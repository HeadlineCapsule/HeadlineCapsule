# 民主党捐助者警告乔·拜登：对加沙的立场威胁到连任竞选 

乔·**拜登**在2024年寻求连任之际面临潜在威胁，他因对以色列与哈马斯的持续冲突中支持以色列而受到批评。这一批评来自于民主党的重要捐款人乔治·克鲁普（George Krupp），后者敦促总统停止向以色列运送武器。随着加沙人道主义危机的恶化，拜登在战争问题上的立场及其对以色列的支持也在民主党内部造成越来越多的分歧。包括克鲁普在内的捐助者和活动人士表示关切，认为拜登模棱两可的态度会损害他的连任前景。拜登批准了一项价值10亿美元的对以军事援助计划，但在**本杰明·内塔尼亚胡**政府对加沙的空袭造成大量平民伤亡后，暂时停止了向以色列运送炸弹。此举招致了一些民主党人的批评，他们希望看到拜登政府对以色列采取更强硬的回应。 

民主党担心这个问题可能会导致他们的选票出现分裂。年轻的选民可能因为反对以色列的行动而放弃拜登，而支持以色列的民主党人则可能转向唐纳德·特朗普。这一点在密歇根州的初选中已有所体现，许多民主党人在那里的选举中投了 "未作承诺 "的票，以表达他们对拜登支持以色列立场的不满。与此同时，超级捐款者海姆·萨班批评拜登暂停向以色列运送重型武器，强调支持以色列的犹太选民的重要性。然而，民权组织谴责了这些言论，而其他知名人士，如纽约州州长凯西·霍楚尔和J街的帕特里夏·戈登则表达了对拜登方法的支持，同时承认需要减少加沙平民伤亡。 

尽管到2024年3月底，拜登成功筹集到的资金比特朗普多6,600万美元，但民主党内部仍存在担忧。他们担心，目前民意调查中特朗普领先以及对拜登处理以巴冲突方式的批评可能会损害他的连任机会，如果现在举行选举的话。

# Democratic donors warn Joe Biden that Gaza stance threatens re-election bid 

**Joe Biden**, facing a potential threat to his **2024 reelection bid**, has come under fire from prominent **Democratic Party** donor George Krupp, who urged the president to halt arms shipments to Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas. This appeal comes as there is growing division within the Democratic Party over Biden's stance on the war and his support for **Israel**. Krupp, along with other donors and activists, has expressed concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and believes that Biden's equivocation is damaging his reelection prospects. The president's approval of a $1 billion military aid package to Israel, while temporarily pausing a shipment of bombs over Netanyahu's stance on Rafah, has drawn criticism from some Democrats who want a tougher response against **Benjamin Netanyahu**'s government as the death toll in Gaza mounts. 

There are fears that this issue could cause a split in the Democratic vote, with younger voters opposed to Israel's actions potentially abandoning Biden and pro-Israeli Democrats possibly defecting to Donald Trump. This was reflected in Michigan's primary elections, where a significant number of Democrats voted "uncommitted" due to Biden's stance on Israel. Meanwhile, mega donor Haim Saban criticized Biden for halting a shipment of heavy weapons to Israel, citing the importance of Jewish voters who support Israel as a key factor. However, civil rights groups have condemned these remarks, and other prominent figures such as New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Patricia Gordon of J Street expressed their support for Biden's approach while acknowledging the need to mitigate civilian casualties in Gaza. 

Despite Biden's successful fundraising efforts outpacing Trump's by $66 million at the end of March 2024, there are concerns within the Democratic Party that opinion polls favoring Trump coupled with ongoing criticism over his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict could jeopardize his reelection chances if the election were held today.
