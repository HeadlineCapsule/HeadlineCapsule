杰夫·贝索斯支持《华盛顿邮报》陷入困境的负责人，并向员工发表备忘录

**杰夫·贝索斯支持《华盛顿邮报》领导层度过危机** 

亚马逊创始人、亿万富翁杰夫·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）公开表达了对《华盛顿邮报》（Washington Post）领导层的支持，强调在保持高标准新闻报道的同时，需要发展业务实践。针对首席执行官威尔·路易斯（Will Lewis）和面临道德指控的新编辑们，贝索斯向《邮报》高级员工发送了一封题为“优质新闻”的电子邮件。

贝索斯承认该组织因世界快速变化而需要改变，但保证高标准将保持不变：“《邮报》不能一切照旧……这一点不会改变，也不会被改变。”

这份备忘录旨在平息反对路易斯（由贝索斯在2019年任命）的反对声浪，并表明他支持这位首席执行官：“我会全力支持你们维护我们都相信的质量、道德和标准。”

在贝索斯十多年前以2.5亿美元收购《邮报》以来，它在唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统任期内取得了增长，但最近面临挑战，包括在2020年大选后失去一半受众，去年亏损7700万美元。

当路易斯取代执行编辑萨莉·巴兹比（Sally Buzbee）任命他的前道琼斯同事时，新闻室反抗路易斯，这引发了对他道德和领导能力的问题。自那时起，《邮报》发起了独立调查，同时声称贝索斯对他们的报道没有任何影响。

知名记者质疑路易斯作为出版商的能力，但这一决定完全取决于贝索斯。

 **Jeff Bezos Supports Washington Post Leadership Amidst Crisis**  

Billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has publicly expressed support for the embattled leadership of The Washington Post amid a recent crisis, emphasizing the need to evolve business practices while maintaining high journalistic standards. In response to backlash against CEO Will Lewis and new editors facing ethical allegations from their past in British journalism, Bezos sent an email titled "Quality Journalism" to senior staff at The Post.

Bezos acknowledged the need for change within the organization due to rapid world evolution but reassured that high standards would remain unchanged:  
_"It can't be business as usual at The Post... That can’t change — and it won’t,"_ he wrote.

The memo aimed to quell opposition against Lewis, who was appointed by Bezos in 2019, and signal his support for the CEO:  
_"You have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,"_ said Bezos.

Under Bezos's ownership since acquiring The Post over a decade ago for $250 million, it experienced growth during Donald Trump's presidency but has faced challenges recently, including losing half of its audience post-2020 election and posting a $77 million loss last year.

The newsroom revolted against Lewis after he replaced executive editor Sally Buzbee with his former colleagues from Dow Jones, leading to questions about his ethics and fitness for leadership. The Post has since launched an independent investigation into the matter while maintaining that Bezos holds no influence over their reporting.

Prominent journalists have questioned Lewis's ability to continue as publisher; however, this decision rests solenly with Bezos.
