戛纳广告节寻找笑点，AI威胁广告业

# 2023年戛纳国际创意节引入幽默类别，强调笑料和讽刺是与受众建立难忘联系的关键元素

## 要点：
- **戛纳国际创意节奖项新增幽默类别**：今年节日上的年度奖项将首次包括幽默类别。目的是庆祝通过笑声与受众建立难忘联系的机智和讽刺。
- **广告行业的 AI 采用**：随着广告机构越来越多地采用人工智能（AI）工具，人们担心这会对该行业的创造力产生影响。高管们相信，人类创造力对于推出幽默且有效的活动仍然至关重要。
- **人类联系与 AI 创造力**：行业专家认为，尽管 AI 可以讲笑话，但它们通常缺乏达到真正有趣所需的共同理解水平。这突显了广告中人类创造力的重要性。
- **AI 的角色和对就业的影响**：哈瓦斯、公共关系、WPP 和电通等机构正在戛纳国际创意节上展示他们在 AI 方面的最新投资。尽管 AI 在创建逼真图像和跨平台优化活动方面很有用，但它也取代了该行业的一些工作。
- **幽默作为创造力增强器**：尽管在过去的 20 年中有所下降，但幽默仍然是广告中受众接受度的重要创造性增强器。康塔尔的研究表明，与非幽默活动相比，幽默活动更具表现力、参与度和独特性。
- **向效果的转变**：广告商面临着来自董事会向下施压的压力，要求他们证明创意活动的价值。许多人认为，让受众发笑就像激发其他情绪（如悲伤或同情心）一样有效，并强调展示结果而不是仅仅关注以目的为导向的广告的重要性。

## 挑战：
- **全球幽默吸引力**：由于不同地区对幽默的看法存在文化差异，因此创建在全球范围内都有趣的活动具有挑战性。
- **幽默的主观性**：幽默的主观性质意味着并非所有受众都会发现相同的东西很有趣，这可能会导致广告活动中的分裂。

 **Summary:**  
The 2023 Cannes Lions festival introduces a new humour category for its annual awards, emphasizing wit and satire as essential elements in creating memorable connections with audiencuences. This addition reflects the industry's concerns over creativity amidst rapid AI adoption within advertising agencies.

**Key Points:**  
- **Humour Category Added to Cannes Lions Awards**: For the first time, a humour category will be included in the annual awards at this year's festival. The aim is to celebrate wit and satire that create memorable connections with audiences through laughter.

- **AI Adoption in Advertising Industry**: As advertising agencies increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) tools, there are concerns about the impact on creativity within the industry. Executives believe that human creativity remains crucial for producing humorous and effective campaigns.

- **Human Connection vs AI Creativity**: Industry experts argue that while AI can produce jokes, they often lack the necessary level of shared understanding to be genuinely funny. This highlights the importance of human creativity in advertising.

- **AI's Role and Impact on Jobs**: Agencies such as Havas, Publicis, WPP, and Dentsu are showcasing their latest investments in AI at Cannes Lions. While AI has proven useful for creating realistic images and optimizing campaigns across platforms, it is also replacing some jobs within the industry.

- **Humour as a Creative Enhancer**: Despite its decline over the past 20 years, humour remains an essential creative enhancer of receptivity in advertising. Kantar's research indicates that humorous campaigns are more expressive, involving, and distinct compared to their non-humorous counterparts.

- **Shift Towards Effectiveness**: Advertisers face pressure from boards to demonstrate the value of creative campaigns. Many believe that making audiences laugh can be just as effective as evoking other emotions like sadness or empathy, and they emphasize the importance of showing results rather than focusing solenly on purpose-led advertising.

**Challenges:**  
- **Global Humour Appeal**: Creating globally funny campaigns can be challenging due to cultural differences in what is considered humorous across various regions.

- **Subjectivity of Humour**: The subjective nature of humour means that not all audiences will find the same things funny, which may lead to divisiveness within advertising campaigns.
