海伊节因抗议活动取消了贝利吉福德的赞助

# Hay Festival 暂停了巴克莱·吉福德（Baillie Gifford）的赞助，因为演讲者和表演者抗议这家总部位于爱丁堡的资产管理公司与以色列和化石燃料行业的涉嫌联系。

在活动人士提出索赔并艺术家面临巨大压力的情况下做出了这一决定，巴克莱·吉福德是艺术界著名的赞助商，为许多英国文学节提供了支持。

## 潜在后果：

- 财务挑战：每年赞助金约为 130 万英镑。
- 影响节日声誉和与其他赞助商或未来潜在赞助商的关系。
- 展示了 Hay Festival 对解决其受众和艺术家所提出问题的承诺，这可能会长期加强他们的关系。

## 巴克莱·吉福德的回应：

- 否认对在被占领的巴勒斯坦领土上经营的公司进行大量投资的指控，声称与以色列的商业往来与其整体业务相比很小。
- 强调他们支持清洁能源，并持有电动汽车制造商特斯拉和瑞典电池制造商 Northvolt 的股份。
- 声称他们不是化石燃料行业的重要投资者，仅将其客户资金的 2% 投资于此类公司。
