朝圣期间极端高温天气导致1300人死亡

**极端高温导致哈吉朝觐1300人死亡**

今年前往麦加朝觐的朝圣者中，有1301人因极端高温天气而死亡。这些死者大多是未经授权的朝圣者，他们在没有遮荫处和休息的情况下长距离跋涉，包括一些老年人和患有慢性疾病的人。

沙特阿拉伯当局在朝觐前几周多次发出警告，敦促人们不要未经授权前往麦加朝圣。他们还建议朝圣者采取预防措施，应对预计将出现的极端高温天气。然而，许多人成功避开了麦加周围的安全检查站，抵达了该城，其中包括来自埃及的数百人。

未经授权的朝圣者无法获得基本服务或适当的住宿，以应对气温升高到近90度（50摄氏度）的高温。卫生部长表示，所有穿着朝觐服的人都被视为朝圣者，无论他们的授权状态如何，都可以获得全面的医疗保健服务。

将对任何为未注册朝圣者组织旅行的公司进行调查，这些公司没有提供后勤支持，导致朝圣者在常规框架之外死亡。埃及总理穆斯塔法·马布利（Mostafa Madbouly）威胁要采取强硬决定和严厉惩罚，以避免类似事件再次发生。

前往麦加朝觐需要特殊的签证，根据各国穆斯林人口的数量进行配额分配。然而，由于朝圣费用高昂，一些国家的等待名单很长，导致许多人选择在官方系统之外旅行。哈吉朝觐的时间由伊斯兰希吉历决定，该历法每年比西方使用的格里高利历向前移动约11天。从2030年开始，朝圣者可以期待几年的气候条件会更加温和，因为那时朝圣季节将落在冬季。

 **Extreme Heat at Hajj Pilgrimage Blamed for 1,300 Deaths**

During this year's hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, extreme temperatures resulted in the death of 1,301 individuals. The majority of these fatalities were unauthorized pilgrims who had walked long distances under direct sunlight without shelter or rest, including elderly people and some suffering from chronic illnesses.

Saudi authorities have issued multiple warnings against attempting to perform the hajj without authorization in the weeks leading up to the pilgrimage earlier this month. They also advised pilgrims to take precautions against the expected hot weather at the holy sites. However, many people managed to evade security checkpoints around Mecca and reach the city, including hundreds from Egypt.

Without authorization, these unauthorized pilgrims had no access to basic services or proper accommodation to deal with the heat as temperatures rose to nearly ninety degrees Celsius (50C). The health minister stated that all individuals dressed for hajj are considered pilgrims and receive full healthcare services, regardless of their authorization status.

Investigations will be launched into any company which organized travels for the unregistered pilgrims who died outside regular frameworks without providing logistical support. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly threatened strong decisions and severe punishment to avoid a repetition.

The hajj requires specific visas, allocated on a quota system based on countries' Muslim populations sizes. However, the high cost of pilgrimage and long waiting lists in some countries lead many to travel outside the official system. The timing of the hajj is determined by the Islamic Hijri calendar, which shifts forward approximately 11 days each year on the Gregorian calendar used in the west. Pilgrims can expect milder weather conditions for several years after 2030 as the hajj season then falls in winter.
