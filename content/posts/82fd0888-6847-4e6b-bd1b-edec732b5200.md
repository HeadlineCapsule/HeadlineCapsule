# 在新一轮工业革命中，英国通信管理局的《儿童法》雄心不足

在数字时代，**儿童在线安全** 已成为日益紧迫的问题，最近的《在线安全法》和英国通信管理局的《**儿童安全实践守则**》旨在解决这一问题。 尽管这些举措是朝着正确方向迈出的一步，但它们可能还不足以保护儿童免受互联网的潜在伤害。

**技术部门** 长期以来忽视了儿童在其平台上的存在，允许他们访问不适当和有害的内容。 新法规旨在通过要求公司关注其儿童用户并采取措施保护他们来解决此问题。 这包括引入**年龄门槛**，以防止访问色情内容，儿童越来越容易访问此类内容，这导致了**强奸文化** 的正常化。

《儿童法》背后的研究凸显了问题的严重性，研究发现，年仅 8 岁的儿童以 18 岁以上的身份注册应用程序，经常遇到推广 **自杀、自残和进食障碍** 的内容。 然而，该法在解决**直播和即时通讯**等高风险功能方面存在不足，也没有鼓励可能更有效的**安全新方法**。

该法并没有专注于**安全设计和默认安全**，而是依赖于儿童选择使用保护工具，但由于大多数人永远不会更改默认设置，因此这可能并不有效。 该法的实施速度缓慢及其复杂性也受到批评，有人担心它可能无法跟上迅速发展的在线环境和迫在眉睫的**人工智能**威胁。

随着我们迈向未来，至关重要的是推动更快、更具雄心的立法，坚持现有的儿童保护原则，应对数字时代带来的独特挑战，包括人工智能的潜在风险。

# In a new industrial revolution, Ofcom’s children’s code is not ambitious enough

**Online child safety** has become an increasingly pressing issue in the digital age, with the recent **Online Safety Act** and **Ofcom's Children's Safety Code of Practice** aiming to address it. While these initiatives are a step in the right direction, they may not go far enough to protect children from the potential harms of the internet. 

/n/n

The tech sector has long ignored the presence of children on their platforms, allowing them access to inappropriate and harmful content. The new regulations aim to address this by requiring companies to be aware of their child users and take steps to protect them. This includes introducing **age-gating** to prevent access to pornography, which has become increasingly accessible to children and has contributed to the **normalization of rape culture**. 

/n/n

The research behind the Children's Code highlights the extent of the problem, with children as young as 8 signing up to apps as 18-year-olds and regularly encountering content promoting **suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders**. However, the Code falls short in addressing high-risk features such as **livestreaming and direct messaging**, and fails to incentivize **new approaches to safety** that could be more effective. 

/n/n

Instead of focusing on **safety by design and default**, the Code relies on children opting into protective tools, which may not be effective given that most people never change default settings. The slow pace of implementation and the complexity of the Code also draw criticism, with concerns that it may not be able to keep up with the rapidly evolving online landscape and the looming threat of **artificial intelligence**. 

/n/n

As we move forward, it is crucial to push for faster, more ambitious legislation that adheres to existing principles of child protection and addresses the unique challenges posed by the digital age, including the potential risks of AI.
