# **腾讯**在网络广告热潮中利润猛增

作为中国市值最高的上市公司，**腾讯**公布其季度利润大幅飙升，**同比增长62%**，2024年第一季度净收入达到**人民币420亿元（5.8亿美元）**。这一出色的业绩归功于对**高利润业务**的重心转移，特别是**网络广告**和**电子商务**。自今年年初以来，腾讯的股价上涨了**30%**以上，表明投资者对中国科技股的信心回归。

腾讯的网络广告销售额大幅增长了**26%**，达到**人民币265亿元**，这得益于其在广受欢迎的**微信平台**上整合**人工智能广告基础设施**和精准广告投放。这一战略举措被视为该公司取得的一项重大胜利。此外，腾讯大举进军**短视频内容**领域，用户关注度提高了**80%**，同时还投资了**直播电商**，丰富了商品品类，并从广告和销售费中获得收入。

一年多前，中国政府放松监管审查，为腾讯提供了有利的背景，政府表示支持国内互联网巨头。腾讯还得益于游戏许可证审批的恢复，其国内游戏业务呈现复苏迹象，得益于像**《Valorant》**和**《失落的方舟》**这样的新游戏。随着**《地下城与勇士》**手游版本的即将推出，腾讯预计第二季度的销售额将强劲增长。

腾讯董事长兼首席执行官**马化腾**将积极成果归功于游戏业务的“团队重组”，并表示有信心为未来游戏收入增长奠定基础。腾讯正按计划实施2024年**1000亿港元（128亿美元）的股票回购计划**，重申了其为股东创造价值的承诺。

随着腾讯不断多元化发展和创新，其强劲的财务表现证明了其在充满活力的中国科技领域的韧性和适应能力。
