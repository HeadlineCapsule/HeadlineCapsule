美国推动全球并购市场初现回暖迹象

# 全球并购交易额达1.5万亿美元

全球并购交易额在2024年上半年达到1.5万亿美元，美国大型交易推动了显著增长。与去年同期相比，这些交易的价值增长了22%，主要由于超过100亿美元的超大型合并和收购交易数量增加以及大额交易数量增加。然而，5000万美元或以下的小型收购数量有所下降，而这种小型收购对于交易市场的基石至关重要。

美国发挥了关键作用，占全球并购交易价值的一半以上（7960亿美元），是自2019年以来的最高份额。欧洲的交易数量也增长了43%，而亚太地区则下降了21%。关键交易包括康菲公司以225亿美元收购马拉松石油公司，以及阿布扎比国家石油公司可能以144亿欧元收购科思创公司。

尽管大型交易有所增加，但并购活动仍因消费者担忧、选举和低于预期利率下降而变得脆弱。金融服务部门表现出潜力，与去年同期相比，交易量增长了60%。由私募股权支持的并购也增长了40%，因为买方投资者寻求出售资产以获得投资回报。

高盛、摩根大通和摩根士丹利等大型银行增加了其在全球并购交易咨询费市场的份额。高盛在2024年上半年是美国和欧洲的首席金融顾问。

 **Summary:**  
Global merger and acquisition (M&A) deals reached $1.5 trillion in the first half of 2024, with a significant increase driven by large-scale transactions in the United States. The value of these deals was up by 22% compared to the previous year, primarily due to a surge in megamergers worth over $10 billion and an uptick in big deals. However, there has been a decline in smaller acquisitions valued at $500 million or less, which are essential for the deal market's backbone.

The US played a crucial role as it accounted for more than half of the global M&A value ($796 billion), marking its largest share since 
2019. Europe also experienced growth in deals with a 43% increase by value, while Asia-Pacific saw a decline of 21%. Key transactions included ConocoPhillips' acquisition of Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company's potential agreement to take over Covestro for €14.4 billion.

Despite the uptick in large deals, M&A activity remains fragile due to concerns about consumers, elections, and slower-than-expected rate reductions. The financial services sector showed promise with a 60% increase in deal volumes compared to the same period last year. Private equity-backed M&A also rose by 40%, as buyout investors aim to sell assets for returns on their backers' investments.

Large banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley increased their share of the global advisory fee market in M&A deals, with Goldman Sachs leading as the top financial advisor in both the US and Europe during the first half of 2024.
