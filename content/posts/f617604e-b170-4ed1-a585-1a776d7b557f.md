# **滴滴**联合创始人卸任董事长

***刘青******（Jean Liu）**从中国网约车巨头**滴滴出行**的**董事长兼董事会成员**职位上卸任。这一决定距离该公司在美国引发争议的首度公开募股(IPO)已过去两年，当时就受到北京方面的严格审查和制裁。 

在周日发给员工的一封电子邮件中，刘青和 **滴滴首席执行官（CEO）程维** 宣布她将转任首席人才官一职，继续留在公司。尽管担任新职位，但刘强调自己仍致力于滴滴未来的成功，并重点关注组织转型和人才发展工作。 

刘曾是中国最知名的女性科技领袖之一，以从苹果公司(Apple)和软银集团(SoftBank)获得大量投资而闻名。然而，在备受争议的IPO后，由于数据违规，该公司被中国监管机构处以44亿美元的罚款，此后她的影响力逐渐减弱，她删除了多年来发布的所有微博帖子，在滴滴也退居幕后。 

此次人事变动正值公司财务状况有所改善之际；然而，它可能会推迟在香港上市的计划——去年转为柜台交易后，股东一直在推动这一计划。随着刘青从高管职位卸任，她的前得力助手**（Stephen Zhu）**于去年先一步离职，这为滴滴潜在的领导层挑战和内部紧张关系提供了线索。 

尽管面临这些挑战，程维坚称，在公司努力摆脱监管麻烦、实现长期增长的过程中，刘青仍然是他的最亲密伙伴

# Didi co-founder steps down as president


**Jean Liu**, who **co-founded** the **Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi**, has stepped down from her role as **president and board member**. The decision comes two years after a contentious initial public offering (**IPO**) in the US that drew scrutiny and sanctions from Beijing. 

In an email to employees on Sunday, Liu and **Didi CEO Cheng Wei** announced she would be transitioning to the role of chief people officer while remaining with the company. Despite her new position, Liu affirmed her dedication to Didi's future success and emphasized that her responsibilities remain unchanged as she focuses on organizational transformation and talent development. 

Liu was once one of China's most prominent female tech leaders known for securing significant investments from Apple and SoftBank. However, following the **controversial IPO**, which resulted in a $4.4 billion fine from Chinese regulators for data breaches, her presence diminished as she deleted years' worth of Weibo posts and took on a more behind-the-scenes role at Didi. 

The transition comes amid improving financial stability within the company; however, it may delay plans for a Hong Kong listing pushed by shareholders following the over-the-counter trading shift in 2022. With Liu's exit from executive roles, **Stephen Zhu**, her former top lieutenant who preceded her departure last year, has shed light on potential leadership challenges and internal tensions at Didi. 

Despite these challenges, Cheng affirmed that Liu remains his closest partner as they navigate the company through regulatory troubles toward long-term growth
