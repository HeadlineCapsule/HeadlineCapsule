英国准备批准40年来最大的上市制度改革方案

**英国金融行为监管局（FCA）将批准对上市制度进行重大改革**

英国金融监管机构 FCA 准备在本月批准对该国 40 年来上市制度进行最大规模的改革。这些变化旨在提振伦敦股市，并在 7 月 4 日选举后新政府成立后的数周内宣布。

FCA 董事会将于 6 月 27 日举行会议，决定是否批准最终规则版本，其中包括放宽在伦敦上市公司的监管要求。这些变化是英国吸引更多企业和投资者进入英国市场的更广泛努力的一部分。然而，人们对这些改革可能带来的风险表达了一些担忧。

FCA 首席执行官 Nikhil Rathi 承认，根据新规则寻求上市的公司存在“失败的可能性”以及“巨大的机遇”。 FCA 的计划包括将伦敦证券交易所（LSE）的优质和标准上市部门合并为一个类别，这可能会导致对合并和收购等企业交易的监督减少。

英国股市一直受到缺乏首次公开募股（IPO）和增加私下交易的影响。例如剑桥芯片设计师 Arm 选择在美国上市，而 Flutter 和 CRH 等富时 100 指数公司已将主要上市地移至纽约。

新的上市规则是英国试图振兴 LSE 市场地位的更广泛努力的一部分。虽然许多城市顾问欢迎这些变化，但一些投资者表达了对改革可能削弱投资者保护的担忧。

 **UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to Approve Major Overhaul of Listing Regime**

The UK’s financial watchdog, FCA, is set to approve the biggest overhaul of the country’s listing regime in 40 years as early as this month. The changes aim at boosting London's ailing stock market and could be announced within weeks following the formation of a new government after the July 
4 election.

The FCA board will meet on June 27 to decide whether to approve the final version of the rules, which include easing regulatory requirements for companies seeking to list in London. The changes are part of a wider effort to attract more businesses and investors to the UK market. However, some concerns have been raised about potential risks associated with these reforms.

FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi has acknowledged that there is "potential for failure" as well as "great opportunity" from companies seeking to list under the new rules. The FCA plans include combining premium and standard listing segments on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) into one category, which could lead to less scrutiny of corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions.

The UK's stock market has suffered from a lack of initial public offerings (IPOs) and an increase in take-private deals. Companebsuch as Cambridge-based chip designer Arm have chosen to float in the US instead, while FTSE 100 companies like Flutter and CRH have moved their primary listings to New York.

The new listing rules are part of a broader attempt by the LSE to revitalize its market presence. While many City advisers welcome these changes, some investors express concerns about potential watering down of investor protection under the reforms.
