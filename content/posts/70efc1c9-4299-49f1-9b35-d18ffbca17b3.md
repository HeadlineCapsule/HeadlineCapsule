支持脆弱民主使命，美国加强选举监督

**支持脆弱民主国家选举：美国加强选举监督**

卡特中心的民主项目正在美国增加选举监督，因为该国政治两极分化加剧，选民对即将于11月举行的总统选举缺乏信心。这个由前总统吉米·卡特创立的项目旨在支持脆弱民主国家的选举，现在将重点关注在美国多达5个州开展的非党派选举观察任务。

**背景**：
民主项目之前曾在刚果民主共和国、委内瑞拉和塞拉利昂等国开展工作。该项目扩大到国内监督，是因为唐纳德·特朗普前总统的支持者对2020年特朗普输给乔·拜登后提出的选举欺诈指控表示担忧。

**项目扩展**：
卡特中心的主席，也是吉米·卡特的孙子杰森·卡特表示，他们已经把他们的国际选举观察专业知识“内化”到解决美国民主令人不安的问题上。该项目于2020年开始支持美国观察员，并在2021年加强了国内工作，为选民提供信息，鼓励美国达到国际选举标准，促进非党派公民观察，并努力缓解可能的选举暴力。

**挑战**：
美国16个州没有立法承认非党派观察员，而代表政党或候选人的党派“投票监督员”越来越积极地提出与他们的利益相反的投票问题。卡特中心主任大卫·卡罗尔强调了保持观察的非党派性质的重要性，这与他们的国际工作类似。

**最近的努力**：
该项目今年早些时候与新墨西哥州和蒙大拿州的当地组织合作，发布了关于米索拉县初选的报告，结论是选举总体上“管理良好”，但呼吁为选民提供更多公开信息，并提高选票透明度。卡特中心计划在即将举行的总统选举中扩大工作范围，重点关注三个摇摆州：密歇根州、亚利桑那州和佐治亚州。

**对美国民主的担忧**：
卡特中心和贝克研究所智库联合发布了一份报告，警告了动荡时期，国内动荡和两极分化加剧。国际民主和选举援助学会将美国评为“高绩效民主国家”，但指出过去五年来，立法监督效果等指标显著下降。

 **Mission to Support Fragile Democracies: US Election Monitoring Steps Up**

The Carter Center's Democracy Program is increasing election monitoring in the United States amid growing political polarization and voter distrust ahead of November's presidential contest. The program, created by former President Jimmy Carter to support elections in fragile democracies, will now focus on non-partisan election observation missions in up to five US states.

**Background:**
The Democracy Program has previously worked in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela, and Sierra Leone. The program's expansion into domestic monitoring comes amid concerns raised by supporters of former President Donald Trump regarding electoral fraud claims following his loss to Joe Biden in 2020.

**Program Expansion:**
Jason Carter, chair of the Carter Center and grandson of Jimmy Carter, stated that they have turned their international election observation expertise "inward" to address troubling aspects of American democracy. The program began supporting US observers in 202amooring elections in 2020 and bolstered its domestic efforts in 2021 by providing information to voters, encouraging the US to meet international election standards, promoting non-partisan citizen observation, and working to mitebate possible electoral violence.

**Challenges:**
Sixteen US states do not have legislation recognizing non-partisan observers, while partisan "poll watchers" representing political parties or candidates are increasingly active in raising concerns around voting that goes against their interests. The Carter Center's director, David Carroll, emphasized the importance of maintaining a non-partisan approach to observation, similar to its international work.

**Recent Efforts:**
The program partnered with local organizations in New Mexico and Montana earlier this year, releasing a report on Missoula County's primaries that concluded the election was "well administered" overall but called for more publicly available information for voters and greater transparency regarding ballots. The Carter Center plans to expand its work for the upcoming presidential elections in three swing states: Michigan, Arizona, and Georgia.

**Concerns Over US Democracy:**
A joint report by the Carter Center and Baker Institute think-tank warned of a tumultuous period marked by domestic unrest and polarization. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance rates the US as "a high-performing democracy" but notes significant declines in measures such as legislative oversight effectiveness over the past five years.
