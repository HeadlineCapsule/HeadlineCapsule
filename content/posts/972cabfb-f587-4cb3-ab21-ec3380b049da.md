# 美国大幅提高对中国电动汽车和半导体进口的关税

**乔·拜登**总统宣布大幅提高对一系列中国进口商品的关税，包括将电动汽车的关税提高四倍，半导体的关税提高一倍。此举旨在保护美国就业岗位，并给予美国企业时间来与中国公司在**绿色技术**领域竞争。提高关税是**拜登在锈带地区竞选选票**的一项选前策略的一部分，白宫的目标是价值180亿美元的中国商品。这包括对中国电动汽车征收100%的关税，以及对钢铁、铝和锂离子电池的更高税率。这一举措得到了工会的欢迎，但遭到商业团体的批评，并引起了**中国外交部的回应**。拜登为自己的做法辩护，称他正在对中国采取一种“明智的方法”，与他的前任**唐纳德·特朗普**形成对比，后者指责拜登行动太慢。美国官员表示，预计这一政策转变不会损害稳定美中关系的努力。

# US sharply raises tariffs on Chinese EVs and semiconductor imports 

**President Joe Biden** has announced a significant increase in tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, including a quadrupling of tariffs on electric vehicles and a doubling of tariffs on semiconductors. The move is designed to protect American jobs and give US companies time to compete with Chinese competitors in the **green technology** sector. The tariff increases are part of a pre-election strategy as **Biden campaigns for votes in the rust belt**, with the White House targeting $18 billion worth of Chinese goods. This includes a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs and higher rates for steel, aluminum, and lithium-ion batteries. The move has been welcomed by unions but criticized by business groups, and has drawn a response from **China's foreign ministry**. Biden has defended his approach, stating that he is taking a "smart approach" to handling China, in contrast to his predecessor, **Donald Trump**, who has accused Biden of acting too slowly. This shift in policy is not expected to undermine efforts to stabilize relations between the US and China, according to US officials.
