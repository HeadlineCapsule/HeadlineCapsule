人工智能数据标注初创公司Scale估值翻倍至140亿美元。

# **AI数据标注初创公司Scale融资10亿美元** 

**摘要：** 

总部位于旧金山的初创公司Scale AI最近在最新一轮融资中成功筹集了10亿美元。该公司专注于为训练**人工智能模型**提供**标签数据**，这一重大投资使其估值翻倍至140亿美元，为其未来的首次公开募股奠定了坚实基础。 

本次融资由Accel、英伟达、Thrive Capital、Tiger Global Management和Index Ventures等现有投资者参与，同时也吸引了亚马逊、Meta、英特尔资本和AMD风险投资等新投资者。这多样化的支持者阵容凸显了数据在快速发展的**人工智能领域**中的重要性。 

Scale AI由Alexandr Wang创立于2016年，最初专注于为自动驾驶系统**标注图像**。从那时起，该公司显著扩大了其业务范围，为尖端的人工智能应用提供大量准确的标签数据，如OpenAI的ChatGPT。尽管在人工智能生态系统中这一领域并不“性感”，但它却至关重要，使Scale成为该行业中的关键参与者。 

Scale AI的独特卖点在于其能够提供**高质量、复杂的的数据集**，从而使人工智能模型在推理和多任务处理等方面取得长足进步。Wang强调了超越容易获取的互联网数据并转向更复杂的数据源的重要性，以推动人工智能开发领域的进一步发展。然而，一位风险投资家也表达了对Scale收入集中于少数现金流烧钱严重的人工智能企业这一现象的担忧。

对此，Wang断言称Scale是一家类似于英伟达和云服务提供商的基础设施供应商，其业务会受到更广泛模型开发生态系统的影响。此外，他还积极与**美国政府接触**，倡导在美国和中国之间赢得“技术冷战”的重要性。这促使美国国防部授予了该公司一项测试和评估人工智能模型的合同。 

随着最新一轮融资的成功，Scale AI为未来的增长和潜在的公开市场上市做好了准备。该公司的成功突显了数据标注在人工智能行业中的关键作用，并强化了**数据就是新石油**的概念。 


## 问与答：

## **AI Data Labeling Start-up Scale Secures $1 Billion in Funding Round** 

Scale AI, a San Francisco-based start-up specializing in providing **labeled data** for training **AI models**, has successfully raised $1 billion in its latest funding round. This significant investment has doubled the company's valuation to an impressive $14 billion, setting the stage for a potential initial public offering. 

The funding round saw participation from existing investors such as Accel, Nvidia, Thrive Capital, Tiger Global Management, and Index Ventures. Notably, it also attracted new investors, including tech giants Amazon, Meta, Intel Capital, and AMD Ventures. This diverse range of backers underscores the importance of data in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. 

Scale AI was founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang with an initial focus on **labeling images** for autonomous driving systems. Since then, it has expanded its operations significantly, providing vast amounts of accurately labeled data to power cutting-edge AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. This "unsexy" yet critical aspect of the AI ecosystem has positioned Scale as a key player in the industry. 

The company's unique selling point lies in its ability to provide **high-quality** and complex datasets that enable AI models to make leaps in capabilities, such as reasoning and multi-tasking. Wang emphasizes the importance of moving beyond easily accessible internet data towards more sophisticated sources to drive further progress in AI development. However, one venture capitalist expressed concern about Scale's revenue concentration within a small group of cash-burning AI businesses. 

In response, Wang asserts that Scale is an infrastructure provider, similar to Nvidia and cloud providers, whose business is influenced by the broader model development ecosystem. Additionally, he has actively engaged with the US government, advocating for the importance of winning the "tech cold war" against China in the realm of AI. This advocacy has resulted in a contract awarded to Scale by the Department of Defense for testing and evaluating AI models. 

With its latest funding round, Scale is poised for future growth and potential public market entry. The company's success highlights the critical role of data labeling in the AI industry and reinforces the notion that **data** is indeed the "new oil." 


## Questions & Answers: 
- What is Scale AI's unique selling point? 
   - Answer: Scale AI's unique selling point is its ability to provide high-quality, complex datasets for training AI models. This focus on data labeling, though considered unsexy by some, is critical to the advancement of AI capabilities and has positioned Scale as a central player in the industry. 

- Who are Scale's biggest customers? 
   - Answer: OpenAI, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Microsoft are among Scale's biggest customers. These companies utilize Scale's labeled data to train their generative AI models and power applications like ChatGPT. 

- What is the potential concern raised by a venture capitalist regarding Scale's business? 
   - Answer: A venture capitalist expressed concern about Scale's revenue concentration, noting that it relies heavily on a small group of AI businesses that are burning through cash in a competitive race to build superior models. This could potentially impact Scale's stability if these customers' fortunes change or they bring data labeling operations in-house. 

- How has Alexandr Wang positioned Scale in the broader AI ecosystem? 
   - Answer: Wang describes Scale as an infrastructure provider, similar to companies like Nvidia and cloud service providers. By drawing this parallel, he emphasizes that Scale's business is influenced by the broader model development landscape, just as data center providers are affected by the activities of their customers. 

- What is the significance of Scale's contract with the US Department of Defense? 
   - Answer: The contract awarded to Scale by the DoD highlights the company's strategic importance in the context of the "tech cold
