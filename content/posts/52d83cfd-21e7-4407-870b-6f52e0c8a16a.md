# 软银的Arm应该会助力孙正义在人工智能领域的发展

**孙正义**对**人工智能**的大胆投资终于有了回报，**软银集团**连续两个季度实现盈利，这要归功于**Arm**。尽管**愿景基金**报告了亏损，而且之前的科技投资也大多不盈利，但软银已经扭亏为盈，上季度实现净利润2310亿日元。这主要得益于**英国芯片设计公司**Arm的表现，软银持有其90%的股份，目前价值超过1100亿美元。Arm大幅提升了软银的净资产价值，其强劲的收益也为软银贡献了6.2万亿日元的巨额现金储备。

有了这一财务缓冲，孙正义加倍致力于**人工智能**和**芯片相关投资**，引领自动驾驶初创企业的融资，并探索在半导体领域的收购。Arm本身也在扩张，成立了一个**人工智能芯片部门**来开发自己的芯片。然而，在高度竞争的**人工智能**和**芯片**市场中，要保持客户中立的同时寻求发展将是一个挑战，尤其是开发成本很高。此外，考虑到软银以往投资亏损的历史，在当前估值水平上，高价收购**人工智能**初创企业的风险也相当大。尽管如此，孙正义目前的战略展示了一个明确的主题，关键是要找到一种可信的方式将Arm整合到这些计划中。

# SoftBank's Arm Should Give Son a Hand in AI 

**Masayoshi Son's** bold bets on **artificial intelligence** have paid off, with **SoftBank Group** achieving profitability for the second consecutive quarter, thanks to **Arm**. Despite the **Vision Fund** reporting losses and a historical trend of unprofitable tech bets, SoftBank has turned a corner with a net profit of ¥231bn in the recent quarter. This success is largely attributed to the performance of Arm, a **UK-based chip designer** in which SoftBank holds a 90% stake, now valued at over $110bn. Arm has driven a significant increase in SoftBank's net asset value, and its strong earnings have contributed to a substantial cash reserve of ¥6.2tn. 

With this financial cushion, Son is doubling down on **AI** and **chip-related investments**, leading funding rounds for self-driving startups and exploring acquisitions in the semiconductor space. Arm itself is also expanding, establishing an **AI chip division** to develop its own chips. However, maintaining customer neutrality while advancing in the highly competitive **AI** and **chip** markets will be challenging, especially with high development costs. Additionally, the risk of overpaying for **AI** startups at current valuation levels is substantial, given SoftBank's history of investment losses. Nevertheless, Son's current strategy demonstrates a focused theme, and the key lies in finding a credible way to integrate Arm into these plans.
