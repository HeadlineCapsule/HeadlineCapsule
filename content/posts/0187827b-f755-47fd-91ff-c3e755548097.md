美国执法官员称，花旗银行是洗钱犯最喜欢的银行。

**新闻摘要：**
美国执法部门官员声称，涉嫌贩毒的犯罪分子青睐花旗集团进行洗钱，因为他们认为其防欺诈控制措施较弱。2021年1月，两名加利福尼亚州居民在花旗银行自动取款机存入近36000美元的非法现金，他们将这笔钱分成低于1万美元的报告门槛的小额交易进行存款。这两人属于一个犯罪网络，通过花旗银行和其他银行洗白了超过5000万美元。

花旗集团制定了严格的**反洗钱**政策，但由于交易报告保密要求，未对此案发表评论。两名被告均不认罪，其中一人声称自己是在逼迫下行事。文章还强调了越来越复杂精妙的洗钱手法，涉及墨西哥毒贩和中国同伙利用加密应用程序、加密货币和地下银行来掩盖他们的踪迹。

**要点：**
- 涉嫌贩毒的犯罪分子选择花旗集团，是因为他们认为其防欺诈控制措施较弱。
- 两名个人将近36000美元的非法现金存入花旗银行自动取款机，通过将这笔钱分成小额交易来避开报告门槛。
- 被告属于一个犯罪网络，通过花旗银行和其他银行洗白了超过5000万美元。
- 两名个人均不认罪，其中一人声称自己是在逼迫下行事。
- 涉及墨西哥毒贩和中国同伙的洗钱计划越来越复杂精妙。

 **Article Summary:**  
US law enforcement officials claim that alleged drug traffickers favored Citigroup for money laundering due to perceived less robust fraud controls. In January 2021, two California residents deposited nearly $36,000 in illicit cash at Citi ATMs by splitting the sum into smaller transactions below the $10,000 reporting threshold. The individuals were part of a criminal network that laundered over $50 million through Citibank and other banks.

Citigroup has robust anti-money laundering policies in place but did not comment on this specific case due to transaction reporting secrecy requirements. Both accused individuals have pleaded not guilty, with one claiming duress as a defense. The article also highlights the increasing sophistication of money laundering schemes involving Mexican drug traffickers and Chinese accomplices using encrypted apps, cryptocurrency, and underground banks to hide their tracks.

**Key Points:**  
- Alleged drug traffickers chose Citigroup for its perceived less robust fraud controls.
- Two individuals deposited nearly $36,000 in illicit cash at Citi ATMs by splitting the sum into smaller transactions to avoid reporting thresholds.
- The accused were part of a criminal network that laundered over $50 million through Citibank and other banks.
- Both individuals have pleaded not guilty, with one claiming duress as a defense.
- Money laundering schemes involving Mexican drug traffickers and Chinese accomplices are becoming increasingly sophisticated.
