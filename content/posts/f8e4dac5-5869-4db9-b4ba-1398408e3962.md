# **数据中心**让**科技巨头**成为大花钱者

**美国科技巨头**正大量投资**人工智能**及其支持基础设施，最近重点关注在农村地区建设大规模**数据中心**。转向**AI**以及对其潜力的兴奋，尤其是在后疫情时代，导致这些公司的**资本支出**增加。Meta、Alphabet、Microsoft 和 Amazon 在雄心勃勃的数据中心项目上领先一步，而 Apple 仍是特立独行者，尚未完全致力于生成式 AI 战略。

随着这些数据中心的建设和维护，带来了巨大的经济负担。**资本支出**的增加反映在这些公司的财务报告中，显示其在**工厂、财产和设备（PPE）**上的支出显著增加。预计这一趋势将继续下去，预测表明折旧费用将进一步加速。

尽管利润率迄今为止一直得到维持，但这是通过削减成本和延长现有设备的使用寿命来实现的。然而，此类策略是有限的，如果这些公司要继续扩大其数据中心并保持盈利，就需要从其 AI 服务中获得回报。

随着争夺 AI 霸权的竞争愈发激烈，这些科技巨头正押注 AI 的未来，这些投资的结果将对其未来几年的利润产生重大影响。

# Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders 

**US tech giants** are investing heavily in **artificial intelligence** and the infrastructure to support it, with a recent focus on building large-scale **data centres** in rural America. This shift towards **AI** and the excitement around its potential, especially in the post-pandemic era, has led to increased capital expenditure for these companies. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon are leading the way with ambitious data centre projects, while Apple remains an outlier, yet to fully commit to a generative AI strategy. 

With the construction and maintenance of these data centres comes a significant financial burden. The increase in **capital expenditure** is reflected in the companies' financial reports, showing a notable rise in spending on **plant, property, and equipment (PPE)**. This trend is expected to continue, with forecasts indicating further acceleration in capex spending, resulting in higher depreciation expenses. 

While profit margins have been maintained so far, this has been achieved through cost-cutting measures and extending the lifespan of existing equipment. However, such tactics have their limits, and for these companies to continue their data centre expansions and remain profitable, they will need to see returns from their AI services.

As the race for AI dominance heats up, these tech giants are making big bets on the future of AI, and the success of these ventures will have a significant impact on their bottom lines in the years to come.
