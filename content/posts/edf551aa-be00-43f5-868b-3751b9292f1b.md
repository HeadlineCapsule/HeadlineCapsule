# 尼日利亚外卖行业吸引国际投资者

然而，由于尼日利亚通货膨胀率飙升，当地货币在过去一年中对美元贬值了70％，该行业面临着挑战。生活成本危机接近34％，食品通货膨胀率达到40.7％。

尽管存在这些挑战，但像Glovo这样的公司正在尼日利亚进行大量投资，以在非洲建立自己并通过减少送货等待时间来改善服务。其他初创公司，如Chowdeck，已经扩大了业务范围，除了外卖之外，还涉足了药品和杂货等领域。这些企业的成功离不开可靠性，这在尼日利亚这样的新兴市场是一个重要的交付标准。

The market is expected to more than double to $2.4 billion over eight years, with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 11 percent. Start-ups like Chowdeck and Heyfood are competing for market share among Nigeria's population that spends about 60% of their income on food.

Despite these challenges, companies like Glovo are investing heavily in Nigeria to establish themselves on the continent and improve their services by reducing waiting times for deliveries. Other start-ups such as Chowdeck have expanded beyond food delivery into other areas like medicine and groceries. The success of these businesses relies on reliability, which is a premium deliverable in emerging markets like Nigeria.
