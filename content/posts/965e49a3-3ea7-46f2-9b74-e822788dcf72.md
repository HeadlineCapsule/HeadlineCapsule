私募股权公司即将拥有美国三大会计公司之一

**私募股权在美国会计公司中的日益存在**

最近，私募股权集团的兴趣激增，导致美国前30家会计公司可能发生变化，据消息人士透露，三分之一的公司可能很快就会落入他们的所有权之下。这一趋势在今年早些时候Grant Thornton和Baker Tilly的重大销售之后出现，为金融买家进一步收购打开了大门。

**参与交易的主要公司：**

1. 亚特兰大的Aprio据报道正在计划将大部分股份出售给Charlesbank Capital。
2. 纽约的PKF O’Connor Davies和阿拉巴马州的Carr, Riggs & Ingram已聘请银行家进行销售流程。
3. 总部位于加利福尼亚州的Armanino一直在与私募资本提供商讨论出售少数股权。

**监管问题：**
私募股权所有权的影响力不断增强，监管机构对此表示担忧，担心这可能会影响会计公司的“高层语气”并影响审计质量。美国证券交易委员会首席会计师敦促公司领导者对这些潜在影响保持敏感。

**私募股权的热情：**
尽管存在监管问题，但私募股权集团对该行业表现出浓厚的兴趣，New Mountain Capital通过以14亿美元收购Grant Thornton 60%的股份而成为该行业的第二个交易。贷款市场也表现出对此类交易的强劲需求，最近向Grant Thornton提供19亿美元的债务融资以重新融资其负债就是证明。

**结论：**
会计行业正在经历前所未有的私募股权参与度，所有规模的公司都成为收购或投资的目标。虽然这种趋势可能会给合作伙伴和公司本身带来财务收益，但它也引发了人们对该行业审计质量和监管合规性潜在影响的担忧。

 **Private Equity's Growing Presence in US Accounting Firms**

A recent surge of interest from private equity groups has led to a potential shift within the top 30 accounting firms in the United States, with talks indicating that one-third may soon fall under their ownership. This trend follows significant sales earlier this year involving Grant Thornton and Baker Tilly, which have opened doors for further acquisitions by financial buyers.

**Key Firms Engaging in Deals:**
1. Atlanta-based Aprio is reportedly planning to sell a majority stake to Charlesbank Capital.
2. New York's PKF O’Connor Davies and Alabama's Carr, Riggs & Ingram have engaged bankers for sale processes.
3. California-based Armanino has been in talks with private capital providers about selling a minority stake.

**Regulatory Concerns:**
The increasing influence of private equity ownership raises concerns among regulators, who worry that it could impact the "tone at the top" and affect audit quality within accounting firms. The US Securcuities and Exchange Commission's chief accountant has urged firm leaders to be sensitive to these potential implications.

**Private Equity Enthusiasm:**
Despite regulatory concerns, private equity groups have shown significant interest in the sector, with New Mountain Capital making its second deal within the industry by acquiring a 60% stake in Grant Thornton for $1.4 billion. The loan market has also demonstrated robust appetite for such deals, as evidenced by a recent $1.9 billion debt sale to refinance Grant Thornton's liabilities.

**Conclusion:**
The accounting profession is experiencing an unprecedented level of private equity involvement, with firms of all sizes being targeted for acquisition or investment. While this trend may bring financial benefits to partners and the firms themselves, it also raises questions about its potential impact on audit quality and regulatory compliance within the industry.
