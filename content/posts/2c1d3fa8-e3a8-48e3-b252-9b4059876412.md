照片分享应用BeReal被Voodoo以5亿欧元收购

**法国游戏和应用程序开发商Voodoo收购照片共享应用BeReal**

总部位于巴黎的法国视频游戏和应用程序开发商Voodoo以5亿欧元收购了照片共享平台BeReal。这次收购由摩根大通提供咨询，是Voodoo历史上规模最大的收购。Voodoo首席执行官Alexandre Yazdi计划在BeReal上推出付费广告，作为实现盈利同时扩大其活跃用户群体的战略。

BeReal通过其平台促进真实性，与Snapchat和Instagram等利用滤镜和编辑功能的竞争对手形成对比。尽管自2022年以来用户增长停滞不前，但BeReal每月保持约5000万活跃用户。

Voodoo的Aymeric Roffé将成为BeReal的新首席执行官，创始人兼联合创始人Alexis Barreyat将继续积极参与公司的运营。这次收购与专注于人工智能（AI）的法国初创公司Mistral AI筹集6亿欧元资金，估值近60亿美元同时发生。

BeReal用户每天都会收到通知，要求他们在收到通知后的两分钟内使用手机的前后摄像头拍摄快照，从而创建一个“不寻常”的社会网络，所有用户都通过分享图像积极参与其中。BeReal的用户群中，大多数人每周至少登录六天，使其成为扩张和货币化的一个有吸引力的选择。

Voodoo计划在保持流畅的用户体验的同时将广告集成到BeReal中。在BeReal最受欢迎时探索订阅模式的想法之后，他们认识到这种方法具有挑战性，因为目标用户的可支配收入较低。

 **Acquisition of Photo-sharing App BeReal by Voodoo**

Voodoo, a French video game and app developer based in Paris, has acquired the photo-sharing platform BeReal for €500 million. The acquisition was advised by JPMorgan and is the largest in Voodoo's history. Alexandre Yazdi, CEO of Voodoo, plans to launch paid advertising on BeReal as a strategy to move towards profitability while expanding its active user base.

BeReal promotes authenticity through its platform, contrasting with rivals like Snapchat and Instagram that utilize filters and editing features. Despite stagnating in terms of user growth since n 2022, BeReal has maintained a steady monthly active user count at about 50 million users.

Aymeric Roffé from Voodoo will become the new CEO of BeReal, while Alexis Barreyat, founder and co-founder, remains actively involved in the company's operations. The acquisition coincides with Mistral AI, a French start-up focused on artificial intelligence (AI), raising €600 million for an almost €6 billion valuation.

BeReal users are notified daily to take snapshots using both front and back cameras of their phones within a two-minute time window after receiving the notification, creating an "uncommon" social network where all users actively engage by sharing images. The majority of BeReal's user base logs in at least six days per week, making it an attractive prospect for expansion and monetization.

Voodoo plans to integrate advertising into BeReal while maintaining a fluid user experience. This move comes after exploring the idea of a subscription model during its peak popularity but acknowledging that targeting users with less disposable income makes this approach challenging.
