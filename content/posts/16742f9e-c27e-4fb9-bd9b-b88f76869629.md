# 尼日利亚回归“正统政策”，新任央行行长如是说

尼日利亚央行新任行长**奥拉耶米·卡德斯托**（Olayemi Cardoso）表示将回归“**正统货币政策**”，与他的**前任戈德温·埃梅菲莱**（Godwin Emefiele）的做法大相径庭。卡德斯托曾担任花旗集团高管，于 9 月上任，并将**抑制飙升的通货膨胀**作为其首要任务。尼日利亚通胀率达到三十年来的最高水平**33.2%**，食品通胀率达到**40%**。央行在 2 月和 3 月分别大幅加息**400**和**200 个基点**，将关键贷款利率上调至**24.75%**。这些举措因稳定**奈拉**币值和吸引外国投资者而受到赞誉。**国际货币基金组织**对尼日利亚银行致力于**价格稳定性**表示认可，并敦促其维持紧缩的货币政策。然而，由于信贷成本高企，卡德斯托的政策面临国内反对，尽管他承认需要在控制通胀和投资及生产激励措施之间取得平衡。尼日利亚经济目前在非洲排名第三，在**博拉·蒂努布**总统的领导下正在进行重大改革，包括取消燃料补贴和结束汇率挂钩。虽然预计这些改革将带来中期收益，但尼日利亚人目前正面临严重的生活成本危机。预计尼日利亚央行将上调**6-9%**的通胀目标，分析师预测今年年底通胀率将降至**23.9-25.8%**。央行还必须解决影响粮食生产的不安全等结构性问题。

# Nigeria returns to ‘orthodox policy’, says new central bank governor

**Olayemi Cardoso**, the new governor of Nigeria's central bank, has signaled a return to **"orthodox monetary policies"**, marking a sharp departure from the practices of his **predecessor, Godwin Emefiele**. Cardoso, a former Citigroup executive, assumed office in September and has made tackling **soaring inflation** his top priority. With inflation at a three-decade high of **33.2%** and food inflation at **40%**, the central bank has raised interest rates aggressively, with hikes of **400** and **200 basis points** in February and March, respectively, taking the key lending rate to **24.75%**. These moves have been praised for stabilizing the **naira** and attracting foreign investors. The **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** has endorsed the bank's commitment to **price stability**, urging it to maintain tight monetary policy. However, Cardoso's policies face domestic opposition due to the high cost of credit, even as he acknowledges the need to balance inflation control with investment and production incentives. Nigeria's economy, currently the **third-largest** in Africa, is undergoing significant reforms under **President Bola Tinubu**, including the removal of fuel subsidies and the end of the currency peg. While these reforms are expected to have medium-term benefits, Nigerians are currently facing a severe cost-of-living crisis. The central bank's inflation target of **6-9%** is expected to be revised upwards, with analysts predicting a decrease in inflation to between **23.9-25.8%** by the end of the year. Structural issues, such as insecurity affecting food production, are also contributing factors that the bank must address.
