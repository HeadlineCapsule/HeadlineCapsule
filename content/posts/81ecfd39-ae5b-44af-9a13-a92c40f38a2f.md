硅谷的Lightspeed将焦点转向二级市场

翻译：
硅谷的LightSpeed将关注点转移到了二级市场。 

注：由于中文表达习惯，"的"和"将...转向..."更为自然流畅，但若严格直译则为："硅谷 Lightspeed 转向二级市场"。

**文章摘要：**
硅谷的光速创投伙伴公司（Lightspeed Venture Partners）正将其关注点转向二级市场，因为传统风险投资模式在融资放缓和初创企业估值下降的情况下面临挑战。这家管理资产约250亿美元的公司计划向美国证券交易委员会申请成为“注册投资顾问”(RIA)。此举将使光速创投能够将其超过20%的资金用于二级市场交易，超过了目前对风投公司的限制。

光速创投曾早期投资了Snap、Rubrik和Nest等公司，并且是活跃购买Anduril、Rippling和Stripe等私营公司**二次股份**的最活跃的风险投资公司之一。在美**国风险资本融资**降至六年来的最低点，这些公司的投资额下降30%的情况下，该公司转向二级市场。

在过去18个月里，风投的新兴二级市场看到了显著的增长，交易量增长超过50%。光速创投的战略部分是由于其支持者要求返还资金的压力驱动，并包括建立一个数据平台来监控二级市场。

尽管硅谷经济面临挑战条件，但光速创投伙伴公司仍致力于支持其当前的投资，同时探索作为风险投资公司在流动性方面的一个替代路径的**二级市场**。

 **Summary of Article:**  
Silicon Valley's Lightspeed Venture Partners is shifting its focus towards secondary markets due to challenges faced by the traditional venture capital model amidst a slowdown in fundraising and start-up valuations. The firm, which has about $25 billion in assets under management, plans to apply for becoming a "registered investment adviser" (RIA) with the US Securader Exchange Commission. This move would allow Lightspeed to use more than 20% of its funds on secondary market trades, exceeding the current cap for venture capital firms.

Lightspeed has made early investments in companies like Snap, Rubrik, and Nest, and is among the most active VC firms purchasing secondary shares in private companies such as Anduril, Rippling, and Stripe. The firm's shift to secondaries comes amidst a six-year low in US venture capital fundraising and a 30% slump in investments made by these firms.

The nascent secondary market for VC has seen significant growth over the past 18 months, with trading volume increasing by more than 50%. Lightspeed's strategy is partly driven by pressure from its backers to return capital and includes setting up a data platform to monitor secondary markets.

Lightspeed Venture Partners remains committed to supporting its current investments while exploring the secondary market as an alternative path to liquidity for venture capital firms amidst challenging conditions in Silicon Valley's economy.
