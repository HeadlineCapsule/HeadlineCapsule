# 导弹为何成为现代战争的首选武器

**导弹技术**的扩散和进步改变了现代战争的方式，2023年，全球多个行为体使用导弹的数量显著增加。 从**伊朗发射的导弹**被**美国和以色列的防御系统拦截**，到**俄罗斯袭击乌克兰**，以及**胡塞武装袭击中东航运**，导弹正成为越来越多行为体的首选武器。

**导弹**起源于**二战时期德国的火箭**，现已发展成为可高度定制和适应的武器。 在**冷战**期间引入**微处理器**和**精密制导系统**，彻底改变了导弹的准确性和多功能性，使其成为进攻和防御的有效工具。 导弹的尺寸和机动性范围广泛，使用者可以根据需求定制弹药库，从较小的、较难被打击的导弹到较大、更具杀伤力的变体一应俱全。

**导弹技术**易于获取和使用，使其成为现代战斗中的优先选择。 导弹所需的后勤支持有限，可以从陆地、空中或海上发射，使各国能够远程打击对手，而无需将有人平台置于敌方领土。 反坦克、防空和反舰能力的发展使平台更不易隐藏，从而使战场对攻击者更加危险。

然而，导弹在取得决定性战略影响方面的有效性值得商榷。 虽然它们改变了作战方式，但目前尚无证据表明导弹可以单独改变冲突的结果。 通过外科手术式打击来削弱政治意愿的企图往往未能达到目的，美国针对越共和塔利班的战役就证明了这一点。

然而，导弹确实能够提高防御者的成本并维持旷日持久的冲突。 最近的导弹交换表明，行为体如何能够利用导弹进行有限战争，同时对对手造成重大的经济损失。 这种动态有利于伊朗、俄罗斯和朝鲜等国家，它们可以使用导弹挑战更强大的军队，而无需跨越全面战争的门槛，否则它们可能输掉战争。

尽管如此，升级的风险依然存在，因为导弹袭击的有效性可能无意中引发全面冲突的螺旋升级。 因此，现代导弹的交换创造了一种微妙的力量平衡，行为体必须谨慎地权衡这种越来越常见的武器的利弊。

# How missiles became the modern weapon of choice

The proliferation and advancement of **missile technology** have transformed modern warfare, with 2023 witnessing a significant increase in their use by various actors across the globe. From **Iran's barrage of missiles** intercepted by **US and Israeli defenses**, to **Russian strikes on Ukraine**, and **Houthi attacks on Middle Eastern shipping**, missiles are increasingly the weapon of choice. 

**Missiles**, with their roots in **World War II-era German rockets**, have evolved to become highly customizable and adaptable weapons. The introduction of **microprocessors** and **precision-guidance systems** during the **Cold War** revolutionized their accuracy and versatility, making them effective tools for both offensive and defensive purposes. Their wide range of sizes and maneuverability allows users to tailor their arsenals, with options ranging from smaller, harder-to-target missiles to larger, more lethal variants. 

The accessibility and flexibility of **missile technology** have made it a favored option in modern combat. Missiles require limited logistical support and can be launched from land, air, or sea, allowing states to strike from a distance without risking manned platforms in adversary territory. They have made battlefield warfare more dangerous for attackers, with advancements in **anti-tank, anti-air, and anti-ship capabilities** making it harder for platforms to hide. 

However, the effectiveness of missiles in achieving decisive strategic impact is questionable. While they have revolutionized operational warfare, there is limited evidence that they can single-handedly alter the outcome of conflicts. Attempts to erode political will through surgical strikes have often fallen short, as seen in the US campaigns against the Viet Cong and the Taliban. 

Missiles do, however, provide a means to raise costs for defenders and sustain protracted conflicts. The recent exchanges have demonstrated how actors can utilize missiles to engage in limited wars while inflicting significant economic damage on their opponents. This dynamic favors states like Iran, Russia, and North Korea, who can leverage missiles to challenge more capable militaries without crossing the threshold into a full-scale war they might lose. 

Nevertheless, the risk of escalation remains ever-present, as the very effectiveness of missile strikes may inadvertently trigger a spiral into all-out conflict. As such, the modern missile exchanges create a delicate balance of power, where actors must carefully navigate the benefits and dangers of this increasingly prevalent weapon.
