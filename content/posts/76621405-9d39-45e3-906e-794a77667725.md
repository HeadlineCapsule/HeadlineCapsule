其余的96％：如何让更多的慈善资产发挥作用

# 摘要：
这篇文章讨论了基金会如何利用其所有资产产生影响，而不仅仅是通过拨款。它强调，捐赠代表了这些基金会可支配资金的很大一部分（96%），并提出了一个问题：如果将它们用于紧迫的社会和环境挑战，它们会产生什么样的影响？这篇文章还提到了一些基金会采用“影响投资”方法的例子，将积极变化与可持续财务回报相结合。

# 有趣的问题：

1. 问题：如何更有效地利用捐赠来产生超越拨款的影响？
   答案：可以通过采用“影响投资”的方法，将捐赠用于紧迫的社会和环境挑战，同时实现积极变化和可持续财务回报。这涉及到考虑所有资产的影响，而不仅仅是通过赠款提供的资金。例子包括将整个捐赠资金转移到符合使命的投资，或利用它们设计解决社会挑战的新金融工具。

2. 问题：一些基金会采用“影响投资”方法的例子有哪些？
   答案：总部位于美国的加州捐赠基金宣布，将将其40亿美元的全部捐赠资金转移到符合使命的投资；而澳大利亚的保罗·拉米塞基金会则将其30亿美元的捐赠资金承诺用于“全面影响方法”。在英国，盖伊和圣托马斯基金会为其捐赠资金设定了双重任务：既要产生影响，又要获得回报。埃斯米·费尔伯恩基金会正在利用其10亿英镑的捐赠资金来设计解决社会挑战的新金融工具。

3. 问题：基金会采用“影响投资”方法时面临哪些挑战？
   答案：挑战包括从被动策略和成本低的集合基金转向考虑影响的更积极策略，这可能需要选择新的管理人员并雇用额外的资源。其他担忧包括一些具有影响力的基金的记录有限、这种投资方式缺乏流动性、认为这些投资必然是“优惠的”，以及担心超越受托人的法律责任。然而，这些都不是开始采用影响投资方法的障碍。

**Summary:**
The article discusses how foundations can generate impact using all of their assets, not just through grant-making alone. It highlights that endowments represent a significant portion (96%) of the money at these foundations' disposal and questions what impact they could have if directed towards pressing social and environmental challenges. The article also mentions examples of foundations adopting an "impact investment" approach, aligning positive change with sustainable financial returns.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: How can endowments be utilized more effectively to generate impact beyond grant-making? 
   A: Endowments can be directed towards pressing social and environmental challenges by adopting an "impact investment" approach, aligning positive change with sustainable financial returns. This involves considering the impact of all assets, not just money given away through grants. Examples include moving entire endowments toward mission-aligned investments or using them to design new financial instruments that address societal challenges.

2. Q: What are some examples of foundations adopting an "impact investment" approach? 
   A: The US-based California Endowment Fund announced it would move its entire $4bn endowment toward mission-aligned investments, while the Australian Paul Ramsey Foundation committed its $3bn endowment to a 'total impact approach.' In the UK, Guy's and St Thomas’ Foundation set dual mandates for their endowments: for both impact and returns. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation is using its £1bn endowment to design new financial instruments that address societal challenges.

3. Q: What are some of the challenges faced by foundations when adopting an "impact investment" approach? 
   A: Challenges include moving from passive strategies and pooled funds, which have low costs, to more active strategies with impact in mind that may require choosing new managers and hiring additional resources. Other concerns are limited track records of some impactful funds, lack of liquidity when investing this way, the belief that these investments are necessarily "concessionary," and worries about going beyond Trustees' legal responsibilities. However, none of these should be blockers to getting started with an impact investment approach.
