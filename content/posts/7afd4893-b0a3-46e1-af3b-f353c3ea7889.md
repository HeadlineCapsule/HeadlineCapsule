# 威爾斯20萬人居住於受重金屬污染的土地附近

根據提交給英國下議院威爾士事務委員會的證據，**威爾斯超過20萬人（約佔總人口的6%）可能受到歷史金屬礦山活動造成的土壤鉛污染影響**。**林肯大學的馬克·麥克林教授**使用**每百萬份中300ppm鉛**的門檻估計了處於危險中的人口數量，世界衛生組織表示這一水平會產生有害影響。

英國缺乏土壤中可接受的鉛濃度最低標準，而美國最近將其門檻降低到**每百萬份200ppm**。委員會了解到廢棄金屬礦山造成的環境和健康風險的證據，每年有**500噸有害金屬**泄漏到威爾士環境中。這影響了用於食品生產的土壤和洪泛區，而氣候變化加劇了這個問題。

調查還發現威爾斯缺乏協調行動和監管監督。雖然**威爾斯自然資源局（NRW）**監測水污染，但沒有土壤污染的綜合測試制度。地方當局負責確定受污染土地，但委員會無法確認是否有任何機構正在積極測試重金屬污染。這引發了人們對當前體制在保護公眾健康方面的有效性的擔憂。

最近的一項研究進一步凸顯了這一情況，該研究發現廢棄礦山下游農場生產的雞蛋中含有有害水平的鉛，可能對食用這些雞蛋的兒童的認知功能產生影響。威爾斯估計有**1300個廢棄礦山**，因此亟需進行修復和有效的監管行動。然而，進展緩慢，自2011年僅啟動了一個大型修復項目，目前仍在進行中。

# 200,000 people in Wales live near land contaminated with heavy metals

**More than 200,000 people in Wales, or 6% of the population, are potentially affected by soil contaminated with lead from historic metal mining activities**, according to evidence presented to the House of Commons Welsh affairs committee. **Professor Mark Macklin of the University of Lincoln** used a threshold of **300 ppm of lead** to estimate the number of people at risk, a level with harmful effects according to the **World Health Organization**. 

/n/n

The UK lacks a minimum standard for acceptable lead concentrations in soil, while the US has recently lowered its threshold to **200 ppm**. The committee heard evidence of the environmental and health risks posed by abandoned metal mines, with **500 tonnes of harmful metals** leaking into the Welsh environment annually. This has impacted soil and floodplains used for food production, and the problem is exacerbated by **climate change**. 

/n/n

The investigation also revealed a lack of coordinated action and regulatory oversight in Wales. While **Natural Resource Wales (NRW)** monitors water pollution, there is no comprehensive testing regime for soil contamination. Local authorities are responsible for identifying contaminated land, but the committee was unable to confirm if any were actively testing for heavy metal pollution. This has led to concerns about the effectiveness of the current system in protecting public health. 

/n/n

The situation is further highlighted by a recent study that found harmful levels of lead in eggs produced on farms downstream from abandoned mines, with potential cognitive impacts on children consuming these eggs. With an estimated **1,300 abandoned mines in Wales**, the need for remediation and effective regulatory action is urgent. However, progress has been slow, with only one large-scale remediation project started in 2011 and still ongoing.
