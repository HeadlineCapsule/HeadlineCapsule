瑞银投资者在美国纽约法院起诉瑞士

**瑞银债权人起诉瑞士** 

在史无前例的一举动中，瑞银的债权人已向纽约法院提起诉讼，起诉瑞士政府。原告正在寻求8220万美元的赔偿，他们声称，在银行去年被竞争对手瑞银救助时，他们的财产权利受到了“不公正的侵犯”。

这些债权人持有价值8000万美元的瑞银债券，认为瑞士在安排交易时优先考虑国家利益而不是其法律义务，该交易在接管期间消除了170亿美元的债务。原告声称，他们持有额外的一级债券（AT1），当贷款人遇到麻烦时，这些债券会转换为股权或被减记，他们的权利受到了非法侵犯。

由Quinn Emanuel Urquhart＆Sullivan代表债权人提起的诉讼指控瑞士放弃了其监管角色，充当私人投资银行。原告声称，在交易期间，股息投资者获得了33亿美元，而他们的AT1债券被不公平地减记。

由于许多国家之间存在互惠投资条约，因此主权国家因征用而被起诉的情况很罕见。然而，瑞士与债权人居住的几个国家，主要是美国，没有这样的条约。Quinn Emanuel有过通过法院起诉国家的历史，去年曾就与阿根廷金融危机后债务重组相关的主权债券对阿根廷胜诉。

瑞士政府没有立即回应对此事的评论请求，这是美国法院首次就瑞银收购瑞银案提起重大索赔。

 **Credit Suisse Bondholders Sue Switzerland**  

In an unprecedented move, bondholders from Credit Suisse have filed a lawsuit against the Swiss government in a New York court. The plaintiffs are seeking damages amounting to $82.2 million for what they claim was an "unjust violation" of their property rights during the bank's rescue by rival UBS last year.

The bondholders, holding **$80 million** worth of Credit Suisse bonds, argue that Switzerland prioritized national interests over its legal obligations when orchestrating the deal to wipe out $17 billion in debt during the takeover. The plaintiffs allege that their rights were unlawfully encroached upon as they held additional tier one (AT1) bonds, which convert into equity or are written down when a lender runs into trouble.

The lawsuit is brought by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan on behalf of the bondholders and accuses Switzerland of abandoning its regulatory role to act as a private investment bank. The plaintiffs claim that equity investors received $3.3 billion during the transaction, while their AT1 bonds were written down unfairly.

This case is unusual for sovereign states being sued for expropriation due to reciprocal investment treaties between many nations. However, Switzerland does not have such treaties with several countries where the bondholders reside, mainly in the US. Quinn Emanuel has a history of taking nation-states through courts and won a case against Argentina last year over sovereign bonds linked to its post-financial crisis debt restructuring.

The Swiss government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this matter, which is the first major claim brought in a US court regarding the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS.
