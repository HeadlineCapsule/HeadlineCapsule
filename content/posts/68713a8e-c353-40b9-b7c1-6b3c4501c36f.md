# P&O 渡轮总裁在解雇英国船员后获得六位数奖金

**彼得-赫布洛瑟**（Peter Hebblethwaite)，P&O 渡轮的首席执行官，在争议性地解雇 800 名英国籍水手一年多后的 2023 年 4 月 4 日，接受了六位数的奖金。这笔金额为 18.3 万英镑的奖金是除了他 32.5 万英镑的年薪之外额外获得的。这一决定引发了众怒，英国部长们誓言将对违反法律的公司领导人采取行动，因为 P&O 对待员工的方法没有遵循适当的程序。

该公司行为导致其**声誉严重受损**，包括失去与赫尔金禧橄榄球联盟俱乐部（Hull KR）的赞助交易。然而，赫布洛瑟为这一决定辩护，声称这是合法的，而且两项**政府调查**中已经有一项结束，没有采取进一步行动。他还透露，被解雇船员的替代者通常来自菲律宾或印度尼西亚，他们获得的基本工资为每小时约 2.90 英镑，包括**加班费**、**奖金**和**假日工资**在内的总工资为 4.87 英镑。

该公司声称其遵守国际海事标准，并认为作为一家在国际水域经营的国际企业，其业务应受国际法管辖。然而，随着法国新立法的出台和英国即将颁布的法律，要求船员获得国家最低工资，P&O 可能需要重新考虑其用人模式。赫布洛瑟向国会议员保证该公司将遵守任何新的立法，但承认满足船员新的**休息要求**是一个挑战，尤其是那些从远方飞来的船员。该摘要重点介绍了有争议的决定及其后果，重点关注财务和法律影响以及对该公司运营和用人模式的潜在影响。

# P&O Ferries Boss Took Six-Figure Bonus After Sacking of UK-Based Crew 

**Peter Hebblethwaite**, CEO of P&O Ferries, accepted a six-figure bonus in April 04, 2023, just over a year after the controversial dismissal of 800 UK-based sailors. The bonus, amounting to £183,000, was in addition to his annual salary of £325,000. The decision has sparked outrage, with UK ministers vowing to take action against company leaders who break the law, as P&O's treatment of its employees failed to follow proper procedures. 

The company's actions led to a significant **reputational fallout**, including the loss of a sponsorship deal with Hull KR. However, Hebblethwaite defended the decision, stating that it was legal and that one of the two **government investigations** had concluded with no further action. He also revealed that the seafarers hired to replace the sacked crew, often from the Philippines or Indonesia, receive a basic hourly wage of about £2.90, which, including **overtime**, **bonuses**, and **holiday pay**, starts at £4.87. 

The company's position is that it complies with international maritime standards and that international law should govern its operations as an international business in international waters. However, with new **legislation** in France and upcoming UK laws mandating the national minimum wage for crew, P&O may need to reconsider its crewing model. Hebblethwaite assured MPs that the company would comply with any new legislation, but acknowledged the challenge of meeting new **rest requirements** for crew, particularly those flown in from long distances. The summary highlights the controversial decisions and their fallout, with a focus on the financial and legal implications, as well as the potential impact on the company's operations and crewing model.
