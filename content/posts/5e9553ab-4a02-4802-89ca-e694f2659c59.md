**Summary:**  
ITV, a British broadcaster, has decided to take a stake in online estate agent Purplebricks through their "media for equity" investment fund. This strategy involves swapping advertising inventory for minority equity stakes in digital businesses. The agreement with Purplebricks will be the first deal of 2024, and ITV plans to launch a new TV advertising campaign for Purplebricks nationally in summer 2024.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: How does the "media for equity" investment strategy benefit both ITV and digital businesses like Purplebricks?  
A1: The "media for equity" investment strategy benefits ITV by allowing them to diversify their portfolio with stakes in promising startups, while also providing advertising inventory. For digital businesses like Purplebricks, this arrangement offers access to traditional TV advertising and the potential to grow operations using more conventional methods after relying on digital platforms.

Q2: What challenges did Purplebricks face before partnering with ITV?  
A2: Before partnering with ITV, Purplebricks faced several challenges including a failed business model that led to overexpansion and lack of traction in the market. This resulted in their stock price collapsing, leading them to sell themselves to Strike for £1. The departure of founders Michael and Kenny Bruce also marked a significant change in leadership.

Q3: How might ITV's investment impact Purplebricks' future growth and disruption of the estate agent market?  
A3: With ITV's investment, Purplebricks is well-positioned to continue its disruption of the estate agent market by leveraging TV advertising to build brand awareness and market share. The partnership could potentially help Purplebrinks reach millions of viewers across Britain, thus driving growth and expanding their customer base.

**Conclusion:**  
ITV's investment in Purplebricks through its "media for equity" strategy represents a strategic move to diversify its portfolio while providing advertising inventory to digital businesses.
