厨师超过软件开发人员成为英国技术工人签证申请人

## 摘要：
文章讨论了英国技术工人签证申请的转变，厨师现在超过软件开发人员，成为这些签证中移民中最常见的职业。这一变化反映了更广泛的趋势和食品及酒店业等低薪行业的劳动力短缺。

2024年3月之前的一年里，有6,203名厨师获得了技术工人签证，比前一年增加了54%。相比之下，在此期间，程序员和软件开发人员的工作许可证数量减少了一半多，从8,752人降至4,280人。

国家统计局报告称，2023年英国移民人数接近纪录水平，约有122万人来英，工作超过学习成为移民的主要原因。这一增长是由护理工人及其亲属签证数量激增所驱动的。

然而，高薪行业的技术工人签证数量有所下降：管理咨询（下降42%）、金融和保险业（下降35%）以及专业、科学和技术活动（下降36%）。政府提高技术工人签证最低工资的要求可能促成了这一转变。

厨师是受这些变化影响最大的职业之一，因为他们2023年4月的平均年薪为22,877英镑，而新的最低工资要求为38,700英镑或年轻工人的30,800英镑。向厨师发放的签证数量增加主要是由于南亚移民的到来。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 问题：英国技术工人签证的格局随着时间的推移发生了怎样变化，哪些因素促成了这些变化？
   答案：随着时间推移，英国技术工人签证中移民最常见的职业发生了转变。厨师现在超过软件开发人员，成为排名第一的职业。促成这一变化的因素包括低薪行业如食品和酒店业的劳动力短缺、政府提高技术工人签证最低工资的要求以及工作超过学习成为移民主要原因所驱动的移民趋势。

2. 问题：这些技术工人签证的转变对英国各行业有何影响？
   答案：技术工人签证的变化对不同行业的影响各不相同。低薪行业，如食品和酒店业，由于劳动力短缺，通过技术工人签证抵达的移民人数有所增加。相比之下，高薪领域的签证数量下降，这很可能受到提高最低工资要求的影响。

3. 问题：政府政策和规则变化如何影响了不同职业的技术工人签证分配？
   答案：政府政策和规则变化，如提高技术工人签证的最低工资要求，对这些签证在不同职业中的分布产生了重大影响。像厨师这样的低薪职业由于平均年薪低于新门槛而更有可能不符合资格。相比之下，高薪行业的技术工人签证数量下降，因为它们更

## Summary:
The article discusses a shift in the UK's skilled worker visa applications, with chefs now surpassing software developers as the most common occupation among migrants arriving on these visas. This change reflects wider trends and labor shortages within lower-paid sectors such as food and hospitality.

In the year to March 2024, there were **6,203** skilled worker visas granted to chefs, a rise of **54%** from the previous year. Conversely, work permits for programmers and software developers more than halved during this period, dropping from **8,752** to **4,280**.

The Office for National Statistics reported that immigration remained close to record levels in 2023 at roughly **1.22 million** people coming to the UK, with work overtaking study as the main reason for migration. This increase was driven by a surge in visas granted to care workers and their relatives.

However, highly paid sectors experienced a decline in skilled worker visas issued: management consultants (down **42%**), finance and insurance sector (down **35%**), and professional, scientific, and technical activities (down **36%**). The government's rule change to increase the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa has likely contributed to this shift.

Chefs are among those most affected by these changes due to their lower average annual salary of £22,877 in April 2023 and the new minimum salary requirements (£38,700 or £30,800 for younger workers). The rise in visa grants to chefs was primarily driven by arrivals from south Asia.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How has the UK's skilled worker visa landscape changed over time and what factors have contributed to these changes?
   A: Over time, there has been a shift in the occupations most commonly represented among migrants arriving on skilled worker visas in the UK. Chefs now surpass software developers as the top occupation. Factors contributing to this change include labor shortages within lower-paid sectors such as food and hospitality, government rule changes increasing minimum salary requirements for a skilled worker visa, and immigration trends driven by work overtaking study as the main reason for migration.
   
2. Q: What impact have these shifts in skilled worker visas had on various sectors within the UK?
   A: The changes in skilled worker visas have affected different sectors differently. Lower-paid sectors, such as food and hospitality, experienced an increase in migrants arriving through skilled worker visas due to labor shortages. Converseby contrast, highly paid areas saw a decline in the number of visas granted, likely influenced by increased minimum salary requirements for eligibility.
   
3. Q: How have government policies and rule changes affected the distribution of skilled worker visas among different occupations?
   A: Government policies and rule changes, such as increasing the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa, have significantly impacted the distribution of these visas among various occupations. Lower-paid occupations like chefs are now less likely to qualify due to their average annual salaries falling below the new thresholds. Conversely, highly paid sectors experienced a decline in skilled worker visas issued as they were more affected by the increased minimum salary requirements.
