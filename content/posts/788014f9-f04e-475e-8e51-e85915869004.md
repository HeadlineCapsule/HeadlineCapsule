# 德国零售存款经纪商莱辛首次实现盈利，客户存款大增

作为一家德国零售存款经纪商，**莱辛**（Raisin）成立 12 年来首次实现盈利，2023 年净利润达 85 万欧元，较去年 3380 万欧元的亏损有了显著改善。这一里程碑式成就归功于客户存款的大幅增长，随着零售客户寻求更高的利率，该公司新增现金流入达 240 亿欧元。

该公司收入接近翻倍，达到 1.585 亿欧元，**息税折旧摊销前利润**（EBITDA）为 2000 万欧元。首席财务官（**CFO**）弗兰克·弗伦德（Frank Freund）将成功归功于公司吸引新客户和资产的能力，并在德国以外的市场表现强劲。通过莱辛进行融资的银行数量增加了 72 家，达到 257 家，管理资产猛增 74%，达到 574 亿欧元。

虽然该公司目前的重点是保持盈利并扩大其在投资产品方面的存在，但在近期并没有上市计划。莱辛的首席财务官表示，公司还没有准备好上市，投资者也没有施加这方面的压力。

凭借其独特的商业模式，莱辛为零售客户提供免费服务，同时从银行赚取佣金，从而成为金融行业的知名企业，吸引了德意志银行、高盛和 PayPal Ventures 等知名投资者的支持。该公司于 2021 年与存款解决方案公司合并，并任命前瑞士银行（**UBS**）董事长兼德国央行（**Bundesbank**）行长**阿克塞尔·韦伯**（Axel Weber）担任其顾问委员会成员，进一步巩固了其地位。

# Raisin turns first profit on surging customer deposits

**Raisin**, a German retail deposit broker, has turned a profit for the first time in 12 years, recording a net profit of €850,000 in 2023, a significant improvement from a €33.8 million loss the previous year. This milestone was achieved due to a surge in customer deposits, with €24 billion in new cash flowing into the company as retail customers sought higher interest rates. 

The company's revenues nearly doubled to €158.5 million, resulting in a positive **EBITDA** of €20 million. **CFO** Frank Freund attributes the success to the company's ability to attract new customers and assets, with a strong performance in markets outside Germany. The number of banks using Raisin for funding increased by 72 to 257, and assets under management surged by 74% to €57.4 billion. 

While the company's current focus is on remaining profitable and expanding its presence in investment products, a potential stock market listing is not on the agenda in the near future. Raisin's **CFO** stated that the company is not yet ready for a public listing and that there is no pressure from investors to move in that direction.

With a unique business model that offers a free service to retail clients while earning commissions from banks, Raisin has established itself as a prominent player in the financial industry, attracting backing from prominent investors such as Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and PayPal Ventures. The company's merger with Deposit Solutions in 2021 and the appointment of **Axel Weber**, former **UBS** chair and **Bundesbank** president, to its advisory board further solidify its standing.
