# 中国“一体机”**AI**产品威胁科技巨头云计算增长战略 

**中国人工智能公司**正推出“**一体化人工智能**”解决方案，让企业可以在自己的场所运行**人工智能应用**，这对**阿里巴巴**、**百度**和**腾讯**等科技巨头提供的**人工智能云服务**构成了威胁。由**华为**引领的这一趋势，将一系列初创企业的**大型语言模型**、**人工智能处理器**和硬件组合在一起进行营销。 

据估计，这些“**全能一体机**”在中国市场的规模预计将于2023年达到**168亿元人民币**（23亿美元），到2027年可能增长到**4500亿元人民币**。这种**人工智能商业化**的转变利用了中国企业对数据保护的担忧，与西方的方法不同。它也可能影响到科技巨头公司的野心，这些公司大量投资于**人工智能基础设施**，并将模型作为云服务出售。 

这一趋势加剧了中国云计算市场的分裂，**华为**在为政府和国有实体提供**私有云**方面占据主导地位，而**阿里巴巴**和**腾讯**则主要为互联网集团服务。后者的商业模式因2021年对科技客户的打击而受到影响，影响了他们的云服务业务。 

分析人士指出，“一体化人工智能”解决方案虽然解决了数据保护问题，但可能不如公共云选项有效，中国企业需要适应变化以求生存。这些产品的泛滥也突显了中国因美国对先进芯片出口管制而面临的**计算能力短缺**的挑战。 

中国的大型国有集团公司更倾向于选择私有云**人工智能**解决方案，这表明市场可能发生转变，对科技巨头公司来说也是一个挑战。

# China’s 'AI-in-a-box' products threaten Big Tech's cloud growth strategies 

**Chinese AI companies** are offering "AI-in-a-box" solutions, allowing businesses to run **artificial intelligence applications** on their own premises, which poses a threat to the **AI cloud services** offered by the country's tech giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. This trend, led by Huawei, involves bundling and marketing **large language models** with **AI processors** and hardware from a range of start-ups. 

The Chinese market for these "all-in-one machines" is expected to reach **Rmb16.8bn** ($2.3bn) in 2023 and could grow to **Rmb450bn** by 2027, according to estimates. This shift in **AI commercialization** capitalizes on data protection concerns among Chinese businesses and diverges from the western approach. It may also impact the ambitions of tech giants that have heavily invested in **AI infrastructure** and models sold as cloud services. 

The trend solidifies the split in the Chinese cloud market, with Huawei dominating **private cloud** provision for government and state-owned entities, while Alibaba and Tencent primarily serve internet groups. The latter's business models were disrupted by the 2021 crackdown on tech customers, impacting their cloud arms. 

Analysts note that while "AI-in-a-box" solutions cater to data protection concerns, they may be less efficient than public cloud options, and Chinese companies will need to adapt to survive. The proliferation of these products also highlights the challenge of **computing power shortages** in China due to US export controls on advanced chips. 

Large state-owned groups in China are showing a preference for private cloud AI solutions, indicating a potential shift in the market and a challenge for tech giants to navigate.
