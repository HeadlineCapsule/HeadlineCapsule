美国最高法院在备受瞩目的案件中避开了财富税问题

**美国最高法院避开了财富税问题**

在最近的一项裁决中，美国最高法院维持了特朗普时代的征税措施，但避免了对实施对超富阶层的财富税的更广泛宪法问题进行裁决。法院的决定让这场备受关注的案件中的双方都感到失望，因为它并没有明确未来这种类型的税收是否会被视为合宪。

查尔斯和凯瑟琳·摩尔提起诉讼，挑战了根据特朗普政府2018年对海外利润征收的强制性遣返税而必须支付的15,000美元。摩尔夫妇认为，这笔钱代表了对他们十年前在印度农村农业企业投资的“未实现”利润的非宪法性掠夺。

最高法院作出了一项狭隘的裁决，大多数法官（7-2）避开了手头的问题，留待将来处理。持反对意见的保守派大法官克拉伦斯·托马斯和尼尔·戈萨奇认为，宪法不允许对未实现收益征税。

税务专家对该裁决的措辞表示松了一口气，该措辞旨在避免质疑证券交易商投资组合中未实现收益等其他现有税收。法院强调，宪法并不要求出现财政灾难，并没有为未来的财富税案件提供明确答案。

总之，虽然美国最高法院维持了特朗普时代的征税措施，但它避开了对实施对超富阶层的财富税的更广泛宪法问题进行裁决。法院的决定留下了这种税收在未来案件中可能被视为合宪的可能性，但没有为政策制定者或活动家提供任何明确的指导。

 **US Supreme Court sidesteps wealth tax question in closely watched case**

In a recent ruling, the US Supreme Court upheld a Trump-era levy but avoided broader constitutional questions regarding the implementation of a wealth tax on the mega-rich. The court's decision disappointed both campaigners for and against such a tax, as it did not provide clarity on whether or not this type of tax would be considered constitutional in future cases.

The case was brought by Charles and Kathleen Moore, who challenged the $15,000 they were forced to pay under the mandatory repatriation tax imposed by the Trump administration's 2018 levy on offshore profits. The Moores argued that this amount represented an unconstitutional raid on "unrealised" profits from their investment in an Indian rural farming enterprise made over a decade earlier.

The Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling, with the majority of justices (7-2) avoiding the question at hand and leaving it for another day. The dissenting conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch argued that the Constitution did not permit a tax on unrealised gain.

Tax experts expressed relief over the ruling's wording, which aimed to avoid calling into question other existing taxes such as those on unrealised gains in securities dealers' portfolios. The court emphasized that the Constitution does not require fiscal calamity and did not provide a clear answer for future wealth tax cases.

In conclusion, while the US Supreme Court upheld the Trump-era levy, it sidestepped broader constitutional questions regarding the implementation of a wealth tax on the mega-rich. The court's decision leaves open the possibility that such a tax could be considered in future cases but did not provide any definitive guidance for policymakers or campaigners.
