# **强硬派**与伊朗民众在德黑兰公园的命运问题上意见分歧

伊朗**强硬派**与普通民众之间，因计划在德黑兰最大的绿色空间之一**盖特拉尔公园**（Qeytarieh Park）建造清真寺而关系紧张。这一争议揭示了伊朗**两极分化的社会**中的分歧，使民众与政权**强硬派**对立。包括**政治和环境活动人士**在内的项目反对者收集了近15万个签名，他们在请愿书中指出，该公园作为污染严重的城市中非常必要的的“肺”，同时也是一座文化遗产遗址。尽管公众反对，德黑兰市长**阿里-礼萨·扎卡尼**（Alireza Zakani）仍坚定不移，他表示将推进该项目，但会重新设计计划以保护成熟树木。

这一争端反映了伊朗民众对强硬派当局更广泛的不满，最近**玛莎·阿米尼**（Mahsa Amini）之死和持不同政见的说唱歌手**Toomaj Salehi**被判处死刑引发的抗议活动就是例证。分析人士认为，反对建造清真寺的活动是伊朗民众表达不满的一种较不对抗的方式。争议还引发了关于宗教在伊朗社会作用的讨论，一些神职人员担心，当局的高压行为正使人们远离宗教，清真寺出席人数减少和日常祈祷人数下降就是证明。支持者声称附近清真寺不够，但反对者反驳说附近已有足够的礼拜场所。

# Hardliners at odds with ordinary Iranians over fate of Tehran park

There is growing tension between **hardliners** and ordinary Iranians over plans to construct a mosque in Tehran's **Qeytarieh Park**, one of the city's largest and oldest green spaces. The controversy has brought to light the divisions in Iran's **polarized society**, pitting citizens against regime **hardliners**. Opponents of the project, including **political and environmental activists**, have gathered nearly 150,000 signatures on a petition, arguing that the park functions as a much-needed "lung" for the polluted city and is also a site of cultural heritage. Despite public opposition, Tehran's mayor, **Alireza Zakani**, remains steadfast, stating that the project will proceed with a redesigned plan to preserve mature trees. 

The dispute reflects a broader discontent with Iran's hardline authorities, as seen in the recent protests triggered by the death of **Mahsa Amini** and the death sentence given to dissident rapper **Toomaj Salehi**. Analysts suggest that the campaign against the mosque construction is a less confrontational way for Iranians to express their discontent. The controversy has also sparked discussions about the role of religion in Iranian society, with some clerics concerned that heavy-handed behavior by authorities is driving people away from religion, as evidenced by sparsely attended mosques and a decline in daily prayers. While supporters of the project argue that there are not enough mosques in the neighborhood, opponents refute this claim, stating that there are already adequate places of worship nearby.
