# **英国** 放弃对露宿者实施严苛处罚计划

面对强烈反对，**英国政府** 放弃了针对**无家可归者**的严厉措施计划，其中包括因“**气味过重**”而对**露宿者**进行**刑事处罚**。在 **保守党议员** 和 **慈善机构** 批评这些提议过于严苛和不人道的压力下，政府做出了这一决定。由前内政大臣 **苏埃拉·布雷弗曼** 起草的原始立法旨在赋予警察对被认为是麻烦制造者的露宿者处以罚款或驱逐的广泛权力，反映了布雷弗曼认为露宿是“一种生活方式选择”的观点。然而，当该计划被揭露包含对帐篷的限制以及针对提供支持的慈善机构的新民事处罚时，它遭到了强烈反对。**慈善机构领导人** 警告称，街头死亡人数可能上升，大约 **40 名保守党议员** 威胁要叛乱。因此，内政大臣 **詹姆斯·克莱弗利** 修改了法案，删除了这些措施。经修改后的立法将使警察能够处理与露宿者有关的特定问题，例如骚扰或环境破坏，但同时将重点放在首先提供支持服务上。政府还承诺在采取行动之前发出额外的警告。虽然这些变化受到欢迎，但批评人士认为，还需要做更多的工作来真正支持无家可归者，包括为 **支持服务** 和 **社会住房** 提供更多资金。

# Plans to criminalise UK rough sleepers dropped after backlash

The **UK government** has abandoned its plans to introduce harsh measures targeting the **homeless population**, which included **criminalizing rough sleepers** for having an **"excessive smell"**. This decision comes after a strong backlash from **Tory MPs** and **charities**, who criticized the proposals as excessive and inhumane. The original legislation, drafted by former home secretary **Suella Braverman**, aimed to give police broad powers to fine or move on "nuisance" rough sleepers, reflecting Braverman's view of rough sleeping as a "lifestyle choice." However, the plan faced intense opposition when it was revealed that it included restrictions on tents and a new civil offense for charities providing support. **Charity leaders** warned of a potential rise in street deaths, and about **40 Conservative MPs** threatened to rebel. As a result, the **home secretary, James Cleverly**, amended the bill, removing these measures. The amended legislation will still enable police to address specific issues related to rough sleepers, such as harassment or environmental damage, but with a focus on offering support services first. The government has also committed to providing additional warnings before taking action. While the changes have been welcomed, critics argue that more needs to be done to truly support the homeless, including increased funding for **support services** and **social housing**.
