## 中国对美国和欧盟发起反倾销调查予以回击 

**中国已启动一项针对来自美国、欧盟、日本和台湾的特定热塑性塑料进口的** **反倾销调查**。 此举被认为是对上述地区近期贸易行动的报复。拜登政府最近宣布将对包括电动汽车和电脑芯片在内的各种中国商品征收关税；而**欧盟也已启动多项针对中国政府补贴产业的调查，涵盖领域如电动车、太阳能电池板以及更广泛的制造业等。** 中国商务部表示该项调查预计耗时一年完成，并有望延长六个月。这一发展延续了特朗普时期所确立的模式，当时类似的针锋相对的行动十分常见。北京方面的回击能力受到与中国和美国及欧盟均存在巨额贸易顺差的限制；尽管如此，此次反倾销调查表明中国有意愿反击那些威胁到中国产业（如清洁能源技术和汽车制造业）的外国贸易壁垒。 对此，欧洲委员会谨慎回应称将在决定7月4日前进一步行动前仔细审查中国的该项调查结果，包括关税或配额等内容。这一来回较量反映了全球贸易政治的复杂动态，各国在清洁能源技术和汽车等关键产业的利益相互博弈。

# China retaliates against the US and EU with anti-dumping probe 

**China has launched an** **anti-dumping investigation** into imports of a specific thermoplastic from the US, EU, Japan, and Taiwan**.** This move is widely seen as retaliation for recent trade actions taken by these regions. The Biden administration recently announced tariffs on various Chinese goods, including electric vehicles (EVs) and computer chips; the **EU has also initiated probes into Chinese government subsidies in sectors like EVs**, solar panels, and manufacturing more broadly. China's Ministry of Commerce stated that it will take a year to complete its investigation with potential for a six-month extension. This development fits a pattern established during the Trump era, where such tit-for-tat actions were common. Beijing's ability to respond is limited by its large trade surpluses with both the US and EU; nonetheless, this probe signals their willingness to counter foreign trade barriers that threaten Chinese industries like clean energy technology and automotive manufacturing. The European Commission has responded cautiously, stating it will review China’s investigation before deciding on further actions regarding EV tariffs or quotas set to be determined by July 4th. This back-and-forth underscores the complex dynamics of global trade politics as countries navigate competing interests in critical industries like clean energy technology and automobiles.
