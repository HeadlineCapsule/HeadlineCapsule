中国贸易机构为俄罗斯买家寻求无人机干扰器

# 中国贸易机构寻求为俄罗斯买家采购无人机干扰器：影响和关切

中国贸易机构**广东省对俄经贸促进会** 最近代表俄罗斯买家寻求购买无人机干扰设备。这一举动凸显了中俄之间的密切联系，同时也引起了美国和欧洲官员对中国向莫斯科供应双重用途技术的担忧。

该协会在其微信社交媒体网站上发布了一则“外国企业采购[无人机]设备通知”，寻求干扰发生器、无人机探测器（贸易名 BorisTone 和 Assel Labs）、无人机压制器、通信频率带干扰器等设备。买家对圣彼得堡 3mx 公司开发的 Bulat 无人机探测器的本地替代品感兴趣。

美国表示希望阻止中国向俄罗斯国防工业供应物资，并认为这是维持俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京战争机器的重要途径。对此，美国财政部副部长沃利·阿迪莫（Wally Adeyemo）称，中国公司必须在在美国/欧洲经济中开展业务或向俄罗斯战争机器提供双重用途商品之间做出选择。

中国在全球无人机供应链中发挥着主导作用，深圳（广东省）的 DJI 是按发货量计算的世界最大商业无人机制造商。美国财政部已经对两个曾经帮助俄罗斯的中国团体实施了制裁：武汉全球传感器技术公司和武汉通胜科技公司。

广东省对俄经贸促进会是在广东省商务厅的指导下成立的，其职责包括协调全球贸易、联系俄罗斯买家、解释经济和贸易政策以及提供与俄罗斯相关的法律咨询服务。该采购通知于 5 月发布。

**问题：**
1. 中国向莫斯科供应双重用途技术有何影响？
2. 这一情况如何影响美国/欧洲与中国的关系，美国对此采取了哪些应对措施？
3. 能否介绍广东省对俄经贸促进会的更多信息及其职责？
4. 双重用途商品是什么，为什么向莫斯科供应这些商品会引起担忧？
5. 中国在全球无人机供应链中的主导地位对这一情况有何影响？

**Chinese Trade Body Seeks Drone Jammers for Russian Buyers: Implications and Concerns**

A Chinese trade body, **Guangdong Province Trade Promotion Association for Russia**, recently sought to purchase drone-jamming equipment on behalf of Russian buyers. This move highlights the close ties between China and Russia amid concerns from US and European officials over China's supply of dual-use technology to Moscow.

The association posted a "Notice of foreign enterprises purchasing [unmanned aerial vehicle] equipment" on its WeChat social media site, seeking interference generators, drone detectors (trade names BorisTone and Assel Labs), UAV suppressors, communication frequency band jammers. The buyers were interested in a locally made equivalent to the Bulat drone detectors developed by St Petersburg's 3mx company.

The US has expressed its desire to halt supplies reaching Russia's defense industry through China and sees this as a vital route for sustaining President Vladimir Putin's war machine. In response, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo stated that Chinese firms must choose between doing business in the US/European economies or equipping Russia's war machine with dual-use goods.

China plays a dominant role in the global drone supply chain, and DJI, based in Shenzhen (Guangdong province), is the world's largest commercial drone maker by shipments. The US Treasury has placed sanctions on two Chinese groups that were previously helping Russia: Wuhan Global Sensor Technology and Wuhan Tongsheng Technology.

The Guangdong Province Trade Promotion Association for Russia was established under the guidance of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce, with responsibilities including coordinating global trade, connecting Russian buyers, interpreting economic and trade policies, and providing legal consultation services related to Russia. The procurement notice was posted on May amo

**Questions:**
1. What are the implications of China's supply of dual-use technology to Moscow?
2. How does this situation affect US/European relations with China, and what measures have been taken by the US in response?
3. Can you provide more information on the role of Guangdong Province Trade Promotion Association for Russia and its responsibilities?
4. What are dual-use goods, and why is there concern over their supply to Moscow?
5. How does China's dominant position in the global drone supply chain impact this situation?
