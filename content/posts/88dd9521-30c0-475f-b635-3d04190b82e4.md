欧盟找到法律漏洞规避匈牙利对支持乌克兰的否决权

# 欧盟法律漏洞：
为了绕过匈牙利对使用俄罗斯被冻结资产利润的否决权，欧盟制定了一个法律解决方案，将布达佩斯排除在有关使用这些资金的决定之外。这一举措也可能促进七国集团为基辅筹集500亿美元的努力，并消除他们计划中的障碍。

# 匈牙利的立场：
作为欧盟中最亲俄的成员国，匈牙利长期以来一直反对27国集团集体军事支持乌克兰。该国还阻挡了七项与武装基辅有关的价值约66亿欧元的决定。

# 欧盟和七国集团的计划：
根据欧盟的计划，自2月以来从俄罗斯被冻结的资产产生的利润将用于购买乌克兰的武器。与此同时，七国集团旨在到12月底为基辅筹集500亿美元贷款，这笔贷款将使用这些资产未来的收益来偿还。

# 法律解决方案讨论：
欧盟外长定于周一讨论这一法律解决方案，这对七国集团协议和今年年底之前发行500亿美元贷款至关重要。这个解决方案将确保匈牙利不会阻挡与武装基辅或无限期冻结俄罗斯资产有关的决定。

# 匈牙利拒绝提议：
尽管布鲁塞尔向布达佩斯提供了一个类似的交易，就像北约上周对总理维克多·奥班所做的那样，即如果不否决其他盟友在联盟伞下协助基辅，就可以选择退出支持乌克兰的活动，但匈牙利拒绝了这些提议。

# 结论：
欧盟的法律解决方案旨在绕过匈牙利对使用俄罗斯被冻结资产利润的否决权，并促进七国集团为乌克兰筹集资金的努力。然而，布达佩斯仍然坚定地反对集体军事支持基辅，并继续在欧盟内部阻挡相关决定。

 **EU Legal Loophole**: To bypass Hungary's veto on using profits from Russia's frozen assets, the EU has devised a legal workaround that excludes Budapest from decisions regarding the use of this money. This move could also facilitate G7 efforts to raise $5n billion for Kyiv and remove hurdles in their plans.

**Hungary's Stance**: Hungary, being the EU's most pro-Russian member state, has long opposed collective military support for Ukraine by the 27-country bloc. The country is also blocking seven other decisions related to arming Kyiv worth about €6.6bn.

**EU and G7 Plans**: Under the EU's plan, profits generated from Russia's frozen assets since February will be used to buy arms for Ukraine. Meanwhile, the G7 aims to raise $50 billion loan for Kyiv by December, which would be paid off using future proceeds from these assets.

**Legal Workaround Discussion**: The EU foreign ministers are set to discuss this legal workaround on Monday, and it is crucial for both the G7 deal and the issuance of the $50 billion loan by year-end. This workaround will ensure that Hungary does not block decisions related to arming Kyiv or keeping Russian assets immobilized indefinitely.

**Hungary's Rejection of Offers**: Despite Brussels offering Budapest a similar deal as Nato did with Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week, giving an opt-out from activities supporting Ukraine in exchange for not vetoing other allies assisting Kyiv under the alliance umbrella, Hungary has rejected these offers.

**Conclusion**: The EU's legal workaround aims to sidestep Hungary'n veto on using profits generated by Russia's frozen assets and facilitate G7 efforts in raising funds for Ukraine. However, Budapest remains firm in its stance against collective military support for Kyiv and continues to block related decisions within the EU.
