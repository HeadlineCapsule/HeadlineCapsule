# 波音供应商 Spirit AeroSystems 面临现金和库存双重困境

为波音 737 Max 制造**机身**的供应商 **Spirit AeroSystems** 由于其主要客户波音公司实施的更严格的质量控制措施而面临财务压力。此举源于 1 月份的阿拉斯加航空公司 737 Max 航班中出现的**舱门面板**脱落事件。因此，Spirit 交付速度放缓，导致库存积压和现金流大幅下降。该公司第一季度净亏损 6.17 亿美元，现金储备从去年的 8.24 亿美元下降至 3.52 亿美元。

Spirit 首席执行官 **Pat Shanahan** 承认了这些挑战，但强调了增加检查的益处，认为这将提高**质量控制**水平，并对两家公司的生产系统有利。然而，这些调整也带来了财务和运营压力，Shanahan 指出，改变的检查流程延缓了已完成机身的付款进度。

该公司 2024 年的财务前景并不明朗，目前正在探索提高流动性的方案。在阿拉斯加航空公司事件后，Spirit 也受到了监管机构的严格审查，调查发现其制造和质量控制存在问题。此外，Spirit 在为空中巴士项目制造的部件上也出现了巨额**预期损失**，而该公司在波音和空客项目之间划分工作，尤其是分离亏损业务，是一项复杂的任务。

波音公司为提高运营质量而潜在重新收购 Spirit 的讨论仍在进行中。同时，Spirit 预计建造的 737 Max 机身数量将少于之前的目标，并且由于生产速度提升缓慢，预计在波音 787 梦想飞机项目的部件上也会出现预期损失。而近期美国联邦航空管理局（FAA）因波音伪造检查记录而展开的调查也使情况更加复杂。受此影响，两家公司的股价均略有下跌。

# Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems’ cash and inventory woes mount

**Spirit AeroSystems**, the manufacturer of **fuselages** for Boeing’s 737 Max, is facing financial strain due to increased quality control measures implemented by its main customer, Boeing. The heightened scrutiny follows an incident in January involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max, where a **door panel** detached in mid-flight. As a result, Spirit has experienced a slowdown in deliveries, leading to a buildup of inventory and a significant increase in cash burn. The company reported a net loss of $617 million in the first quarter, with cash reserves declining to $352 million from $824 million a year ago. 

/n/n

Spirit's chief executive, **Pat Shanahan**, acknowledged the challenges but emphasized the benefits of increased inspections, believing they will enhance **quality control** and benefit the production system between the two companies. However, the adjustments have also brought about financial and operational pressures, with Shanahan noting that the changed inspection process has delayed payments for completed fuselages. 

/n/n

The company's financial outlook for 2024 is uncertain, and it is exploring options to improve liquidity. Spirit is also under regulatory scrutiny following the Alaska Airlines incident, with investigations revealing issues in manufacturing and quality control. Adding to its challenges, Spirit has booked significant **forward losses** on parts built for Airbus programs, and its ability to separate work for Boeing and Airbus, particularly loss-making operations, is a complex undertaking. 

/n/n

The potential reacquisition of Spirit by Boeing, aimed at improving operational quality, remains in discussion. Meanwhile, Spirit expects to build fewer 737 Max fuselages than previously targeted and anticipates forward losses on components for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program due to a slower production rate increase. The recent FAA investigation into Boeing over falsified inspection records further complicates the situation. As a result, shares in both companies have dropped slightly.
