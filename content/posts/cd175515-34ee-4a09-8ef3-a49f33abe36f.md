日本十年期国债收益率十一年来首次突破 1%。

## 概要：
日本**10 年期国债收益率**在 11 年内首次超过 **1%**，因为投资者预计日本央行（BoJ）将进一步加息并减少政府债券购买量。在日本央行于3月结束实施了8年的负利率政策后，自5月13日以来，当日本央行在定期操作中购买的五年期至十年期日本国债数量低于预期时，收益率持续上升。

由于日元跌至 **34 年低点**，这家中央银行面临着收紧政策的压力，据信它多次干预货币市场。SMBC日兴证券利率策略师**香织正治**表示，日本央行可能以快于预期的速度减少债券购买量，这可能是推动收益率上升的原因。

文章还提到了高盛预测的日本央行政策利率在 **2027 年达到 1.5%**以及 10 年期国债收益率到 2026 年年底达到 **2%**。


## 有趣的问题：
问：日本十年期国债收益率十一年来首次超过1%，其原因是什么？
答：日本十年期国债收益率上升的原因是投资者预计日本央行将进一步加息并减少政府债券购买量。这一转变发生在日本央行决定结束实施八年的负利率政策之后，以及市场对该央行在定期操作中购买的债券数量少于预期所做出的反应。

问：若减少购债的速度快于预期会如何影响金融市场和投资者行为？
答：根据 SMBC 日兴证券利率策略师香织正治的意见，减少购债速度加快可能会导致长期债务收益率上升。这可能导致政府和企业借贷成本增加，进而影响投资决策和经济增长。此外，投资者也可能因这些变化而调整他们的投资组合，从而导致金融市场波动。

问：日元贬值对日本经济有何潜在影响？
答：日元走弱可能会对日本经济产生正反两面的影响。一方面，它可能有利于出口商，使他们的产品在国际市场上更具竞争力；但另一方面，也会增加原材料和能源进口成本，从而导致通货膨胀率上升。此外，货币疲软还可能促使当局采取干预措施以稳定日元汇率，进而影响日本央行的货币政策决定。

## Summary:
The article discusses Japan's **10-year yield** surpassing **1% for the first time in 11 years**, as investors anticipate further interest rate hikes and a reduction in government debt purchases by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The BoJ ended its policy of negative rates in March after eight years. Since May 13th, when it bought less than expected amounts of five- to ten-year Japanese government bonds, yields have steadily risen.

The central bank has faced pressure to tighten policies due to the yen's decline to a **34-year low** and is thought to have intervened multiple times in currency markets. Rates strategist Kaoru Shoji from SMBC Nikko Securities suggests that the BoJ may reduce its bond purchases at a faster pace than expected, which could be driving the rise in yields.

The article also mentions Goldman Sachs' prediction of the BoJ raising its policy rate to **1.5% by 2cu27** and 10-year bond yields reaching **2% by the end of 2026**.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: What factors have contributed to Japan's 10-year yield surpassing 1% for the first time in a decade?
A: The rise in Japan's 10-year yield can be attributed to investors increasing their bets on further interest rate hikes and reductions in government debt purchases by the Bank of Japan. This shift follows BoJ's decision to end its negative rates policy after eight years, as well as recent market reactions to smaller than expected bond purchases during regular operations.

Q: How might a faster-than-expected reduction in bond purchases impact financial markets and investor behavior?
A: A quicker pace of reducing bond purchases could lead to higher yields on long-term debt, as observed by rates strategist Kaoru Shoji from SMBC Nikko Securities. This may result in increased borrowing costs for the government and businesses, potentially affecting investment decisions and economic growth. Investors might also adjust their portfolios to account for these changes, which could lead to volatility in financial markets.

Q: What are some potential consequences of a declining yen on Japan's economy?
A: A weakening yen can have both positive and negative effects on the Japanese economy. On one hand, it may benefit exporters by making their products more competitive in international markets. However, it also increases import costs for raw materials and energy resources, which could lead to higher inflation rates. Additionally, a weaker currency might prompt further interventions from authorities to stabilize the yen's value, impacting monetary policy decisions by the Bank of Japan.
