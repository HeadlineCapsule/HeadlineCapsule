# 员工感受到财务不安全带来的负担 

**财务不安全**，尤其在**低收入人群中**，会对身心健康造成严重影响。这在英国是一个日益严重的担忧问题，研究预测，到2040年，贫困地区的人群将比富裕地区的人群提前十年被诊断出重大疾病。 

导致这一问题的原因有很多，包括住房条件差、粮食不安全和**就业不稳定**（如零工合同）等因素。这些因素都会导致压力水平升高。此外，与专业办公室工作相比，体力劳动的工作往往对身体造成更大伤害。COVID-19 大流行进一步凸显了这一差异，远程工作的选择基本不适用于医疗保健和制造业等必要行业的工人——该群体因病毒而死亡的可能性更高。 

**盖洛普（Gallup）**、 **普华永道（PwC）** 和 **德勤（Deloitte）** 等机构的研究强调了财务压力与员工生产率之间强关联；根据 PwC 的研究结果，有经济压力的员工在工作中分心可能性几乎是其他员工的5倍。这凸显出雇主有必要超越仅提供额外福利或更高薪资来解决这些问题。 

诸如金融教育项目等措施可以帮助员工提高理财能力，改善整体健康状况并减少压力水平。此外，应对**法定病假工资**、通过改进换班取消政策以增加工作保障也是减轻财务不安全对雇员福祉不利影响的关键步骤。

# Workers feel the burden of financial insecurity 

**Financial insecurity**, especially among **low-wage earners, has debilitating effects on both physical and mental health**. This is a growing concern in the UK, where studies predict that by 2040, people in deprived areas will be diagnosed with major illnesses a decade earlier than those in affluent areas. 

The problem stems from various factors such as poor-quality housing, food insecurity, and **insecure employment**, including zero-hours contracts, all of which contribute to increased stress levels. Additionally, lower-paid manual labor jobs can take a greater toll on the body compared to professional office roles. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted these disparities, with remote work options largely unavailable to those in essential industries like healthcare and manufacturing—resulting in higher mortality rates from the virus for this demographic.

Research by organizations such as **Gallup**, **PwC**, and **Deloitte** underscores the strong correlation between financial stress and employee productivity; financially stressed employees are nearly five times more likely to be distracted at work, according to PwC's findings. This emphasizes the need for employers to address these issues beyond merely offering perks or higher pay. 

Initiatives such as financial education programs can empower workers with better money management skills while improving their overall health and reducing stress levels. Furthermore, addressing **statutory sick pay** and providing greater job security through measures like improved shift cancellation policies are also crucial steps towards mitigating the negative impacts of financial insecurity on employee wellbeing.
