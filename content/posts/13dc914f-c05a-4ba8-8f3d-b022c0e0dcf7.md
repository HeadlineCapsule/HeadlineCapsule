# 福克斯冀望美国选举广告带来推动力，此前初选“令人失望”

**第一段** 

福克斯首席执行官**拉克兰**·默多克对最近的总统初选季表示失望，指出观众参与度和广告收入低下。然而，他仍然相信即将到来的美国选举将提振该媒体集团的业务。默多克将其归因于两党竞选筹集的巨额资金，以及预计这些资金将用于广告宣传，特别是在密歇根州、威斯康星州和宾夕法尼亚州等竞争激烈的参议院席位竞选中。 

**第二段** 

历史上，美国新闻媒体集团在选举年期间的受众人数有所增加，而2016年和2020年的选举则由于人们对**唐纳德·特朗普**的关注而吸引了创纪录的观众，这一现象被称为“**特朗普**效应”，使福克斯和《纽约时报》等媒体受益。然而，今年的选举缺乏类似的戏剧性，因为**特朗普**和现任总统**乔·拜登**很早就成为领先者，尽管民意调查显示大多数美国人都不支持两位候选人中的任何一位。 

**第三段** 

尽管如此，两位候选人都为总统竞选筹集了大量资金，根据联邦披露信息，与拜登有关的团体筹集了4.13亿美元，与特朗普有关的团体筹集了3.26亿美元。这反映在他们的广告支出上，拜登今年花在广告上的钱为3900万美元，而特朗普则为2500万美元。福克斯本季度的收入较上年下降了15%以上，但其净收入却跃升至7.04亿美元，这得益于一次性和解付款。福克斯股价在上午交易中上涨1.9%。

# Fox hopes for US election ad boost after ‘disappointing’ primary 

**Paragraph 1** 

**Lachlan** Murdoch, CEO of Fox, expressed disappointment in the recent presidential primary season, citing low viewer engagement and advertising revenue. However, he remains confident that the upcoming US election will provide a boost to the media group's business. Murdoch attributes this to the significant amount of money raised by both political campaigns and the expectation that these funds will be spent on advertising, particularly in competitive races for the US Senate in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. 

**Paragraph 2** 

Historically, US news media groups have experienced increased audiences during election years, with the 2016 and 2020 elections drawing record viewers due to the fascination with **Donald Trump**. This phenomenon, known as the "**Trump bump**," benefited outlets such as Fox and The New York Times. However, this year's election lacks a similar level of drama, as **Trump** and incumbent **Joe Biden** were early frontrunners, despite opinion polls indicating most Americans did not favor either candidate. 

**Paragraph 3** 

Despite this, both candidates have raised substantial funds for the presidential race, with Biden-affiliated groups raising $413 million and Trump-affiliated groups raising $326 million, according to federal disclosures. This is reflected in their ad spending, with Biden spending $39 million on ads this year, compared to Trump's $25 million. Fox's quarterly revenue has dropped by over 15% from the previous year, but its net income jumped to $704 million due to a one-time settlement payment. Fox shares are up 1.9% in morning trading.
