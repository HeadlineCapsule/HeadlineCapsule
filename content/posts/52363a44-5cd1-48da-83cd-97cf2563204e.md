工党承诺为塔尔伯特港钢铁厂提供更好的交易

# 摘要翻译：

工党领袖乔纳森·雷诺兹（Jonathan Reynolds）计划于周一访问威尔士南部的塔塔钢铁厂，他声称工党政府将为该厂提供更好的救助方案。保守党政府此前同意向印度东家塔塔钢铁公司提供5亿英镑的纳税人资金，以确保该厂在转向使用电弧炉的低碳生产时的未来发展。然而，这一过渡预计将导致2800人失业，因为塔塔钢铁厂将关闭两处高炉，并用碳排放量较低的电弧炉取而代之。

工党批评了与塔塔钢铁公司的交易，并此前敦促该公司重新考虑一项得到工会支持的妥协计划，该计划将保留一个高炉，直到电弧炉投入运行，这可能需要更多的纳税人资金，但可以挽救就业机会。政府与塔塔之间的协议尚未得到商业和贸易部的批准。

工党领袖基尔·斯塔默（Keir Starmer）表示，他的政党不仅要拯救塔塔钢铁厂的就业机会，还要确保英国钢铁工业的未来发展。他承诺提供30亿英镑的“绿色钢铁基金”，以支持该行业向低碳生产过渡。

行业利益相关者不确定工党对塔塔钢铁厂的计划，但希望该党能够与塔塔钢铁公司达成协议，挽救更多的就业机会。乔纳森·雷诺兹批评了政府与塔塔的协议，并要求保守党商务大臣凯米·巴登奇（Kemi Badenoch）确保在选举之前不要做出关于塔塔钢铁厂未来的不可逆决定。

 **Article Summary:**
Labour leader Jonathan Reynolds plans to visit Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales on Monday, where he claims that a Labour government would provide a better rescue deal for the site. The Conservative government had previously agreed to hand over £500 million of taxpayer money to Indian owner Tata Steel to ensure the future of the site as it shifts towards low-carbon production using an electric arc furnace. However, this transition is expected to result in up to 2,800 job losses due to the closure of two blast furnaces at Port Talbot and their replacement by a less carbon-intensive electric arc furnace.

Labour has criticized the deal with Tata Steel and previously urged the company to reconsider a trade union-backed compromise plan that would retain one of the blast furnaces until the electric arc furnace is operational, which could cost more taxpayer money but save jobs. The agreement between the government and Tata has yet to be signed off by the Department for Business and Trade.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer stated that his party aims not only to save Port Talbot's jobs but also secure the future of steel in the country, as losing it would mean never getting it back. Labour has promised a £3 billion "green steel fund" designed to support the industry during its transition towards low-carbon production.

Industry stakeholders are unclear about what a Labour plan for Port Talbot might entail but hope that the party could strike a deal with Tata Steel to save more of their workforce. Jonathan Reynolds criticized the government's agreement with Tata and sought assurances from Conservative business secretary Kemi Badenoch that no irreversible decisions should be made on Port Talbot's future before the election.
