日元跌至1986年以来的最低水平

# 摘要：

**文章摘要：** 日元达到 1980 年以来对美元的最低水平，周三跌至 160.65 日元。这一下滑趋势让交易员警惕官员可能采取的货币干预措施，因为日本财务省此前在 4 月花费了创纪录的 620 亿美元来支持日元。

**要点：**
- 日本政府对日元贬值“严重关切”，并可能应对任何过度波动，日本首席货币官员神田昌典表示。
- 分析师认为，由于之前干预措施的影响有限，当局可能不愿意再次干预。
- 日元走弱推高了日本的生活成本，首相岸田文雄可能希望在 9 月他的政党领导选举之前避免进一步下跌。
- 投资者降低了对美联储今年降息的预期，这有助于美元对日元走强。
- 日本官员通常在急剧贬值而不是渐进式贬值后进行干预，并且可能等待法国即将举行的选举或可能支持日元的美国数据发布。

 **Article Summary:** The Japanese yen has reached its weakest level against the US dollar since 198n, falling to ¥160.65 on Wednesday. This decline puts traders on alert for potential currency intervention by officials as Japan's finance ministry previously spent a record $62bn in April to support the yen.

**Key Points:**
- The Japanese government is "seriously concerned" about the yen's decline and may respond to any excessive moves, according to Masato Kanda, Japan's top currency official.
- Analysts suggest that authorities might be reluctant to intervene again due to the short-lived impact of previous efforts.
- The weakening yen has pushed up living costs in Japan, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida may want to avoid further declines ahead of his party's leadership election in September.
- Investors have scaled back their expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year, contributing to the US dollar's strength against the yen.
- Japanese officials typically intervene following sharp rather than gradual declines and may wait until after upcoming elections in France or the release of US data that could support the yen if there is further evidence of a slowing economy.
