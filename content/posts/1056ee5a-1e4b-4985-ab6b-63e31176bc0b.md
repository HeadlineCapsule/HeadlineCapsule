# **伊朗** 救援人员找到总统直升机坠毁残骸 

根据伊朗国营媒体报道，**伊朗救援队** 在该国西北部的 **山区** 发现了总统 **易卜拉欣·莱希** 直升机 **坠毁** 的 **残骸** 。直升机于周日因恶劣天气坠毁，浓雾和大雪最初阻碍了救援工作。事发时，莱希结束对该国西北部省份的访问正返回途中，坠机地点位于 **阿拉斯巴拉** 森林，靠近 **阿塞拜疆** 边境。目前还没有关于总统健康状况的信息，伊朗媒体敦促公民 **为他的安全祈祷** 。 

据内政部长 **艾哈迈德·瓦希迪** 称，莱希的直升机在通讯困难的浓雾地区 **硬着陆** 。伊朗 **红新月会** 负责人 **皮尔·侯赛因·科利万德** 已向该地区部署了 40 支快速反应队。由于地形崎岖和天气状况恶劣，伊朗政府还向 **土耳其、沙特阿拉伯、俄罗斯** 和 **欧盟** 寻求援助，协助救援行动。 

这起事件引发了人们对伊朗政治格局潜在影响的担忧，因为莱希预计将在明年 **竞选连任** ，并被外界认为是最有可能接替该国 **最高领袖哈梅内伊** 的人选之一。莱希与 **革命卫队** 保持着密切的关系，并对最高领袖表现出无条件的忠诚，结束了伊朗总统与最高领袖之间几十年的紧张关系。

与此同时，哈梅内伊向民众保证，该国事务不会受到干扰，并请求人们为总统的安全归来祈祷。

# Iranian Rescue Services Find President's Helicopter Wreckage 

**Iranian rescue teams** have located the **wreckage** of President **Ebrahim Raisi's** helicopter in a **mountainous region** in the country's northwest, according to state media. The helicopter **crashed** on Sunday due to adverse weather conditions, and rescue efforts were initially hindered by thick fog and snow. The incident occurred as Raisi was returning from a visit to the country's northwestern province, with the crash site located in the Arasbaran Forest near the border with Azerbaijan. There is no information yet on the president's condition, and Iranian media urged citizens to **pray for his safety**. 

Raisi's **helicopter** experienced a **"hard landing"** in a challenging, foggy region for communication, according to the interior minister, **Ahmad Vahidi**. **Pir Hossein Kolivand**, head of Iran's **Red Crescent**, deployed 40 rapid response teams to the area. The Iranian government also sought assistance from **Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Russia,** and the **EU** to aid in rescue operations due to the challenging terrain and weather conditions. 

The incident has raised concerns about the potential impact on Iran's political landscape, as Raisi is expected to **seek re-election** next year and has been considered a top candidate to succeed the country's **supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**. Raisi has maintained a close relationship with the **Revolutionary Guards** and demonstrated unconditional loyalty to the supreme leader, ending decades of tension between Iran's presidents and the supreme leader. 

In the meantime, **Khamenei** has reassured citizens that there will be no disruptions in the country's affairs and has asked for prayers for the president's safe return.
