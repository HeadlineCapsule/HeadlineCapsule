英国零售业：商店通货膨胀重回“正常”水平

英国商店通货膨胀率已**恢复至正常水平 **，这是英国零售商协会（BRC）的数据显示。5 月商店价格同比增长 0.6%，低于 4 月的 0.8%，远低于 2023 年 5 月达到的 9% 的峰值。这种下降归因于家具、体育用品和园艺工具等大宗商品价格下跌。此外，食品通货膨胀放缓，同比增长率为 3.2%，为 2022 年 2 月以来的最低水平。

英国零售商协会（BRC）还提到，异常潮湿的天气影响了春天的销售，促使零售商降低价格以提振需求。

当前的商店通货膨胀率与历史数据相比如何？

目前的商店通货膨胀率为 0.6%，远低于 2023 年 5 月达到的 9% 的峰值。这一最新数据也是 2021 年 11 月以来的最低水平，表明正如英国零售商协会（BRC）首席执行官海伦·迪克森所说，通货膨胀率已“恢复至正常水平”。从前几个月的下降趋势来看，通货膨胀压力已经缓解，零售商正在通过家具等大宗商品降价来做出回应。

当前的商店通货膨胀率可能对大选前的选民情绪产生什么影响？

通货膨胀和借贷成本的走势是选民关注的关键问题，因为它影响他们对经济健康和财务信心的支持。在 7 月 4 日即将举行的大选中，执政的保守党在民意调查中落后于工党约 20 个百分点。商店通货膨胀率恢复至正常水平可能会对选民产生积极影响，如果他们认为这是经济稳定和现任政府有效管理的一个迹象。然而，就业率、工资增长和公共服务等其他因素也将在大选前塑造选民的意见方面发挥重要作用。

## Summary:
UK shop inflation has returned to **normal levels** according to data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). In May, store prices grew at an annual rate of 0.6%, down from 0.8% in April and well below the peak of 9% reached in May 2023. This decrease was attributed to falling prices on big-ticket items such as **furniture**, sports equipment, and garden tools. Additionally, food inflation slowed with annual growth at 3.2%, its lowest since February 

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What factors contributed to the decrease in UK shop inflation rates?
A1: The decrease in UK shop inflation rates can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there was a significant drop in prices for big-ticket items like furniture and other non-food products. This reduction helped bring down overall store price growth from 0.8% in April to 0.6% in May. Additionally, food inflation slowed during this period, with annual growth at its lowest since February 2022. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) also mentioned that unusually wet weather had impacted sales in the spring, prompting retailers to lower their prices and boost demand.

Q2: How does the current shop inflation rate compare with historical data?
A2: The current shop inflation rate of 0.6% is significantly lower than its peak of 9%, which was reached in May 2023. This recent rate is also the lowest since November 2021, indicating a return to more normal levels as stated by Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. The decline from previous months suggests that inflationary pressures have eased and retailers are responding with price cuts on big-ticket items like furniture.

Q3: How might the current state of shop inflation impact voter sentiment ahead of the general election?
A3: The path of inflation and borrowing costs is a key concern for voters, as it affects their view on the economy's health and financial confidence. With an upcoming general election on July 4th, the ruling Conservative party trails Labour by about 20 percentage points in polls. The current state of shop inflation returning to normal levels may influence voter sentiment positively if they perceive it as a sign of economic stability and effective management by the incumbent government. However, other factors such as employment rates, wages growth, and public services will also play significant roles in shaping voters' opinions ahead of the election.
