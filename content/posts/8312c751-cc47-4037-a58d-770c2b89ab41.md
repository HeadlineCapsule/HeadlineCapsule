# **亚马逊网络服务**首席执行官**辞职**，与**竞争对手**的**人工智能**竞赛如火如荼

**亚马逊**宣布了一项出乎意料的高层变动：**亚马逊网络服务（AWS）首席执行官亚当·塞利普斯基（Adam Selipsky）**即将离职，由**公司老将马特·加曼（Matt Garman）**接替。此举正值亚马逊与**谷歌**和**微软**等竞争对手争相开发和提升**人工智能（AI）**产品和服务之际。

塞利普斯基的离职日期定于**6月3日**，这是他在三年前上任时与**亚马逊**首席执行官**安迪·贾西（Andy Jassy）**商定的。在塞利普斯基的任期内，AWS销售额加速增长，第一季度销售额同比增长**17 %达250亿美元**，利润率也不断提高。AWS是亚马逊的核心利润驱动器，为其经营收入做出了重大贡献。

他的继任者加曼自2005年起就在公司工作，并于2006年开始在AWS全职工作。贾西强调加曼拥有"异常强大的技能和经验组合"，能够胜任新职位，而加曼本人也表示，未来几周内AWS将进行一些组织调整。

此次高层变动正值科技行业竞争激烈之际，各公司争相在快速发展的人工智能领域创新和抢占市场份额。

# Amazon Web Services chief steps down amid AI race with rivals

**Amazon** has announced an unexpected leadership change, with **Adam Selipsky**, the **chief executive of Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, stepping down to be replaced by **company veteran Matt Garman**. This move comes as Amazon races against rivals such as **Google** and **Microsoft** to develop and enhance **artificial intelligence (AI)** products and services. 

Selipsky's departure on **June 3** was agreed upon with **Amazon** chief **Andy Jassy** when he took the role three years ago. During his tenure, Selipsky oversaw an acceleration of sales growth at AWS, with sales rising **17% year-over-year to $25 billion** in the first quarter, alongside widening profit margins. AWS is a core profit driver for Amazon, contributing significantly to its operating income. 

His successor, Garman, has been with the company since 2005 and has worked full-time at AWS since 2006. Jassy highlighted Garman's "unusually strong set of skills and experiences" for his new role, while Garman himself noted that there would be some organizational adjustments at AWS in the coming weeks. 

This leadership change occurs during a period of intense competition within the tech industry, as companies race to innovate and capture market share in the rapidly evolving field of AI.
