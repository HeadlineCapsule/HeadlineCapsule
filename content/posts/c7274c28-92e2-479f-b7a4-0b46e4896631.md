高收入人群更容易接触到人工智能，研究发现

# 研究发现高收入者面临更大的人工智能影响

《科学》杂志最近发表的一项研究表明，软件工程师和数据科学家等高收入者比低薪工人更容易受到人工智能（AI）的影响。这项研究考察了900多个职业，发现近五分之一的员工至少有半数的任务可能受到机器学习进步的影响，尤其是区块链工程师、临床数据管理员、公共关系专家和金融量化分析师等高薪职位。

该研究强调了人工智能对劳动力市场影响的不确定性，国际货币基金组织等组织提出了对高技能行业潜在不平等和工作中断的担忧。研究人员使用人类分析和GPT-4大型语言模型相结合的方法来确定哪些任务可以削减一半以上而不会影响质量。

研究结果表明，人工智能对各种职业的影响可能与计算机化造成的不同，以前受影响最大的是基于常规认知任务的低薪工作。然而，该研究还强调了进一步研究员工的需求和担忧的重要性，因为他们适应这些技术变化。

总之，虽然人工智能的暴露对工人来说可能是有益的，也可能是有害的，这取决于他们的职业，但了解其对劳动力需求的长期影响至关重要，并确保研究得到关于人工智能技术实际经验的见解的补充。

 # Summary of Article: Higher Earners Face Greater AI Exposure, Study Finds

A recent study published in **Science** reveals that higher earners such as software engineers and data scientists are more exposed to the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) than lower paid workers. The research examined over 900 occupations and found that almost a fifth of employees would see at least half their tasks potentially affected by advances in machine learning, particularly those in higher-paid positions like blockchain engineers, clinical data managers, public relations specialists, and financial quantitative analysts.

The study highlights the uncertainty surrounding AI's impact on the labor market, with concerns raised by organizations such as the IMF about potential inequality and work disruption in highly skilled industries. The researchers used a combination of human analysis and GPT-4 large language model to determine which tasks could be cut in half or more without compromising quality.

The findings suggest that AI's implications for various jobs may differ from those caused by computerization, with less well-paid jobs based on routine cognitive tasks being most affected previously. However, the study also emphasizes the need for further research into employees' needs and concerns as they adapt to these technological changes.

In conclusion, while AI exposure can be beneficial or detramoal for workers depending on their occupation, it is crucial to understand its long-term effects on labor demand and ensure that studies are complemented by insights into actual experiences with AI technology.
