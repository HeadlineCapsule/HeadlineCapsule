法院在拉尔斯·温多夫同意出席听证会后撤销逮捕令

# 德国法院暂时撤销了对拉尔斯·温豪特的逮捕令

**摘要：**
德国法院暂时撤销了对拉尔斯·温豪特（Lars Windhorst）的逮捕令，他是被指控在汉诺威伊姆泽中心（Ihme-Zentrum）购物中心和住宅区的破产程序中不予配合的争议性德国金融家。在温豪特承诺出席即将举行的庭审后，法院条件性地撤销了逮捕令。

**要点：**
- 因为未能在伊姆泽中心（Ihme-Zentrum）的破产程序中提供合作，对拉尔斯·温豪特（Lars Windhorst）发出了逮捕令，该中心是汉诺威的一家购物中心。
- 这位金融家无视了交出与该综合体所有权结构、支付流等相关的文件和钥匙的要求。
- 温豪特未能在4月22日出席庭审，也没有为缺席提供道歉。
- 在温豪特同意合作并出席本月晚些时候的排定庭审后，法院批准了有条件地撤销逮捕令。
- 撤销逮捕令取决于温豪特履行这些承诺，如果未能履行，可能会导致长达三周的监禁。

**背景：**
由于两名关键的办公租户提前终止合同并停止支付租金，伊姆泽中心（Ihme-Zentrum）被提交了破产程序，因为温豪特未能兑现其投资数百万美元改造购物中心的承诺。汉诺威的一名律师Jens Wilhelm V被该市地方法院任命为管理人。

**额外的法律麻烦：**
温豪特之前面临过法律挑战，包括对潜在的德国银行法违规行为的已结刑事调查，以及因未能在与摩纳哥亿万富翁相关的一家投资公司提起的案件中出席强制执行庭审而被判藐视法庭罪。

 **Summary:**  
The German court temporarily suspended the arrest warrant against Lars Windhorst, a controversial German financier accused of not cooperating in insolvency proceedings related to Ihme-Zentrum shopping centre and housing complex in Hanover. The conditional lifting came after Windhorst promised to attend an upcoming court hearing.

**Key Points:**  
- **Arrest warrant issued against Lars Windhorst** for failing to cooperate with insolvency proceedings of Ihme-Zentrum, a rundown shopping centre in Hanover.
- The financier ignored requests to hand over documents and keys related to the complex's ownership structure, payment flows, etc.
- **Windhorst failed to attend court hearing on April n**22 and did not provide an apology for his absence.
- A conditional suspension of the arrest warrant was granted after Windhorst agreed to cooperate and attend a scheduled court hearing later this month.
- The lifting of the warrant is dependent on Windhorst fulfilling these commitments, as failure to do so could result in up to three weeks imprisonment.

**Background:**  
Ihme-Zentrum was subjected to insolvency proceedings after two crucial office tenants terminated their contracts early and stopped paying rent due to Windhorst's unfulfilled promise of investing millions in the shopping centre revamp. A Hanover-based lawyer, Jens Wilhelm V, was appointed as administrator by the city’s district court.

**Additional Legal Woes:**  
Windhorst has faced legal challenges before, including a closed criminal investigation into potential breaches of the German banking act and being found in contempt of court for failing to appear at an enforcement hearing related to a case brought by an investment firm linked to a Monaco billionaire.
