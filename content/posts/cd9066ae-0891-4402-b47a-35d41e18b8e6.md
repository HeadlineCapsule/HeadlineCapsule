# 瑞典预计将降低利率，与美国联邦储备委员会的政策背道而驰

预计**瑞典央行**将降低利率，成为首批与美联储货币政策背道而驰的主要央行之一。这一举动预计将为瑞典放缓的经济提供支持，三分之二的经济学家和市场表示降低利率的可能性很高。该决定反映了美国和瑞典不同的经济形势，瑞典的通货膨胀和经济增长较为疲软。

此次潜在的降息具有重要意义，因为它展示了**欧洲**在货币政策上独立于美联储影响的意愿。通常情况下，美联储由于其规模和影响力，在改变利率方面发挥主导作用。然而，随着**欧洲**央行面临不同的经济状况，它们现在在降低借贷成本方面发挥着主导作用。预计**欧洲中央银行(ECB)**也将在下次会议上降息，与欧盟经济密切相关的瑞典将对这一举动产生强烈反应。

人们担心欧洲加快降息步伐可能会导致欧元兑美元贬值，影响进口价格和通货膨胀。尽管如此，瑞典央行仍预计将降息，经济学家预测将采取缓慢渐进的方式。瑞典经济出现收缩，有迹象表明通货膨胀将达到瑞典央行的目标，这使降息成为刺激经济增长的可能策略。

# Sweden Expected to Cut Rates in Test of Divergence from Fed

**The Riksbank**, Sweden's central bank, is anticipated to cut interest rates, becoming one of the first major central banks to diverge from the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve. This move is expected to provide support for Sweden's slowing economy, with two-thirds of economists and markets indicating a high likelihood of a rate cut. The decision reflects the differing economic landscapes of the US and Sweden, with the latter experiencing weaker inflation and growth. 

/n/n

This potential rate cut is significant as it showcases **Europe's** willingness to forge its own path in monetary policy, independent of the Fed. Usually, the Fed's size and influence mean it takes the lead in changing rates. However, with **Europe's** central banks facing different economic conditions, they are now taking the lead in lowering borrowing costs. The **European Central Bank (ECB)** is also expected to cut rates at its next meeting, a move that Sweden's economy, closely tied to the EU, will be sensitive to. 

/n/n

There are concerns that faster rate cuts in Europe could depreciate European currencies against the dollar, impacting import prices and inflation. Despite this, the Riksbank is expected to cut rates, with economists forecasting a slow and gradual approach. Sweden's economy has contracted, and there are signs that inflation will reach the Riksbank's target, making a rate cut a likely strategy to stimulate economic growth.
