欧盟试图避免受到维克多·奥班的否决权影响

# 欧盟寻求避免受到维克多·奥班否决权的制约

欧洲联盟（EU）正在采取措施，保护自己免受**匈牙利疑欧派总理** **维克多·奥班**日益增多的否决权的制约。随着匈牙利于7月1日接任欧盟轮值主席国，该国阻挡或推迟了创纪录数量的需要一致通过的外交和安全政策问题。这种阻挠行为被视为试图强迫获得因法治问题而被冻结的欧盟资金。

即将离任的比利时欧盟理事会主席国提出了几种规避布达佩斯否决权的选项，例如：

1. 利用允许某些决定由合格多数而不是一致通过的条约条款。
2. 要求各国在使用否决权时提供更多解释，并明确说明它们可以在哪些情况下阻止政策。
3. 对布达佩斯采取更强硬的态度，包括抵制在匈牙利举行的部长级会议，或制作欧盟文件机密附件，概述其他成员国之间达成协议的其他途径。
4. 考虑推进针对匈牙利的正在进行的所谓的第七条程序，这可能导致剥夺其投票权，尽管这将需要其余26个成员国的共识。

匈牙利官员提出了一个潜在的交易，即布达佩斯将取消对66亿欧元资金的否决权，以偿还向乌克兰发送武器的费用，以换取在12月中旬之前充分获得因法治和腐败问题而被冻结的63亿欧元欧盟资金。然而，鉴于可能的政治反弹，布鲁塞尔拒绝了这一提议。

总之，欧洲联盟正在积极寻求避免受到匈牙利在维克多·奥班领导下日益增多的否决权的制约。欧盟理事会正在探索各种选项，例如合格多数投票和使用否决权更严格的要求。此外，还有讨论采取更强硬的态度对待布达佩斯，包括通过第七条程序潜在地剥夺匈牙利的投票权。

 # EU Seeks to Insulate Itself from Viktor Orbán’s Vetoes

The European Union (EU) is taking measures to protect itself from the increasing use of vetoes by **Hungary's Eurosceptic premier**, **Viktor Orbán**. As Hungary assumes the bloc's rotating presidency on July 1st, it has blocked or delayed a record number of foreign and security policy issues that require unanimity. This obstructionism is seen as an attempt to force access to EU funds frozen over rule-of-law concerns.

The outgoing Belgian presidency of the EU council has proposed several options to circumvent Budapest's vetoes, such as:
1. Utilizing treaty provisions that allow for some decisions to be taken by a qualified majority instead of unanimity.
2. Requiring more explanations from countries when they use their veto and clarifying the circumstances under which they can block policies.
3. Adopting tougher approaches towards Budapest, including boycotting ministerial meetings held in Hungary or producing confidential annexes to EU documents that outline alternative routes for agreement among other member states.
4. Considering advancing an ongoing so-called Article 7 procedure against Hungary which can culminate with the stripping of its voting rights, although this would require consensus among the remaining 26 members.

Hungarian officials have suggested a potential deal where Budapest would lift its veto on €6.6bn worth of funds to reimburse capitals for weapons sent to Ukraine in exchange for full access before mid-December to €6.3bn of EU funds frozen due to rule-of-law and corruption concerns. However, Brussels has rejected this proposal given the likely political backl

In summary, the European Union is actively seeking ways to insulate itself from Hungary's increasing use of vetoes under Viktor Orbán's leadership. The EU council is exploring various options such as qualified majority voting and stricter requirements for using a veto. Additionally, there are discussions about adopting tougher approaches towards Budapest, including the potential stripping of Hungary's voting rights through an Article 7 procedure.
