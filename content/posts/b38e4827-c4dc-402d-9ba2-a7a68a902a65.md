报告发现，自2010年以来，英国的生活水平一直落后于大多数同行国家。

# 英国生活水平落后于大多数同行国家

研究所财政研究（IFS）的报告显示，自 2010 年以来，**英国的生活水平** 一直落后于大多数同行国家。尽管就业增长迅速，中收入者税收大幅减免，但英国 2009-2010 年至 2022-23 年的可支配收入中位数仅增长了 6%。这种低迷表现的主要原因是工资增长缓慢，在通货膨胀因素后，2023-24 年的平均收入仅比 2009-10 年高出 3.5%。英国 2007 年至 2019 年的工作年龄人口收入增长率是美国的一半，落后于德国 16%。

阿伯丁金融公平信托资助的 IFS 研究破坏了财政大臣杰里米·亨特最近提出的说法，即德国、奥地利和瑞典的生活水平下降幅度大于英国。该报告还强调，由于最高收入阶层收入增长疲弱、更多人被拉入高税率税收范围以及福利削减，自 2009-10 年以来，高收入和低收入家庭都表现不佳。

## 有趣的问题：

**英国工资增长与其他富裕国家（如德国和美国）相比如何？**

IFS 报告表明，2007 年至 2019 年，英国工作年龄人口收入增长率是美国的一半（12% vs. 6%）。此外，它还落后于德国 16%，增长率仅为 6%。这一比较显示，英国在这一时期的工资增长速度比这些国家慢。

**自 2010 年以来，哪些因素导致了英国生活水平的低迷表现？**

该报告确定了导致英国生活水平低迷表现的几个关键因素，包括工资增长缓慢、抵押贷款和税收增加、就业机会减少、更多人被拉入高税率税收范围以及福利削减。这些因素共同影响了中收入者和收入光谱两端的家庭。

**英国在生活水平方面的相对表现自 2019 年以来发生了怎样变化？**

IFS 研究表明，没有明确证据表明英国在生活水平方面的相对表现自 2019 年以来有所改善。然而，它还指出，在新冠肺炎大流行期间和之后收集的数据可能不是严格可比的。这种不清晰性使得很难确定英国自 2019 年以来在同行国家中的生活水平地位是否发生了任何重大变化。

## Summary:
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report reveals that **UK living standards** have lagged behind most peer nations since 2010. The UK's median disposable incomes grew by just 6% between 2009-2010 and 2022-23, despite rapid employment growth and significant tax cuts for middle earners. This underperformance is mainly due to sluggish wage growth, with average earnings being only 3.5% higher in 2023-24 than in 2nought nine-ten after accounting for inflation. The UK's working-age income growth between 2007 and 2019 was half the pace seen in the US, falling behind Germany by 16%.

The IFS research funded by the Abrdn Financial Fairness Trust undermines recent claims made by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt that countries such as Germany, Austria, and Sweden have suffered bigger falls in living standards than the UK. The report also highlights that households on both the highest and lowest income brackets fared worse since 2009-10 due to weaker earnings growth at the top; more people being dragged into higher rate tax bands; and cuts to benefits.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: How has the UK's wage growth compared with other wealthy countries, such as Germany and the US?
A: The IFS report indicates that between 2007 and 2019, the UK's working-age income grew at half the pace seen in the US (12% vs. 6%). Furthermore, it fell even further behind Germany with a growth of only 16%. This comparison shows that wage growth has been sluggish in the UK compared to these countries during this period.

Q: What factors have contributed to the underperformance of UK living standards since 2010?
A: The report identifies several key factors contributing to the underperformance of UK living standards, including sluggish wage growth, higher mortgages and taxes, weakened employment, more people being dragged into higher rate tax bands, and cuts to benefits. These elements have collectively impacted both middle-income earners and households on either end of the income spectrum.

Q: How has the UK's relative performance in living standards changed since 2nought nineteen?
A: The IFS research suggests that there is no clear evidence to indicate an improvement in the UK's relative performance in living standards since 2019. However, it also notes that data collected during and after the Covid-19 pandemic may not be strictly comparable across countries. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine whether there has been any significant change in the UK's standing among its peer nations regarding living standards since 2019.
