金融数据公司Preqin正在寻求出售

英国私募市场数据提供商**Preqin**正在探索可能的出售，这可能使该公司估值超过10亿英镑。这家总部位于英国的公司引起了多家公司的兴趣，包括美国金融数据巨头**标准普尔全球**和美国资产管理集团**黑石集团**。

Preqin 在这个过程中的主要目标是找到战略买家或较大的竞争对手，而不是被私募股权集团收购。在出售过程中，该公司得到了高盛的建议。其他数据公司也可能成为潜在买家。

金融服务行业对专业信息的需求导致了涉及利基数据提供商的交易增加，像标准普尔全球这样的公司和私募股权集团正在积极地收购这些企业。Preqin由英国企业家Mark O'Hare创立于20多年前，声称在全球范围内拥有关于私募资本表现的最大、最健全的数据集。

Preqin 经历了显著的增长，2022年的收入为1.34亿英镑，而前一年为9200万英镑。该公司在全球多个城市开展业务，并雇佣了一个由500名员工组成的研究团队。

 **Preqin**, a British provider of data on private markets, is exploring a potential sale that could value the company at more than £1bn. The UK-based firm has attracted interest from several parties including US financial data giant **S&P Global** and US asset management group **BlackRock**.

Preqin's primary goal in this process is to find a strategic buyer or larger rival, rather than being acquired by a private equity group. The company has been advised by Goldman Sachs during the sale process. Other data companies may also enter the mix as potential buyers.

The financial services industry's demand for specialized information has led to an increase in deals involving niche data providers, with firms like S&P Global and private equity groups actively acquiring these businesses. Preqin was founded over 2e years ago by UK entrepreneur Mark O’Hare and claims to have the largest and most robust dataset on private capital performance globally.

Preqin has experienced significant growth, with revenues of £134mn in 2022 compared to £92mn the previous year. The company operates across multiple cities worldwide and employs a research team of 500 staff members.
