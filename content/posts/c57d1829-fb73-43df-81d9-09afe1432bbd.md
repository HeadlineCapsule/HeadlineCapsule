# 你愿意为树莓派付多少钱？

多功能迷你电脑 **Raspberry Pi** 正在考虑在伦敦证券交易所上市，潜在估值为 6.3 亿美元。由于 Pi 的独特特性，包括其 **广泛的应用领域**、**商业模式转变** 和 **不寻常的所有制结构**，该估值很难确定。

Pi 2023 年的收入为 2.658 亿美元，增长了 41%， **息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）** 则翻了一番，达到 4350 万美元。其电脑的平均售价保持在 43 美元左右。由于失去了 RS Group 作为制造商，该公司毛利率受到影响，但更高比例的高端主板提高了每单位的毛利。

评估 Pi 价值的方法多种多样。一种方法是将 Pi 与 **widget 经销商** 进行比较，因为它之前与 RS Group 有合作关系，后者市值为 39 亿英镑，由于供应链问题得到缓解，RS Group 在 2022 年的收入增长与 Pi 相似。另一种方法是将 Pi 作为 **工业机械制造商** 来评估，因为它专注于商业销售和自动化，类似于在伦敦证券交易所上市的 Rotork，该公司估值为税息折旧及摊销前利润的 15 倍。

Pi 也可以被看作是 **廉价电子产品制造商**，但英国市场缺乏类似的消费电子公司作为比较对象。一个可比较的对象是美国公司 Vizio，沃尔玛收购该公司的估值为 2025 年调整后息税折旧摊销前利润的 15 倍，尽管他们的硬件被赋予了较低的价值。摩根大通将 Vizio 的设备部门价值评估为未来收入的 0.5 倍，这将使 Pi 的估值约为 1.5 亿美元。

Pi 估值的一个有趣方面是其 **公共所有制结构**，即大部分股份由 **专注于向儿童介绍编程的慈善机构** 持有。这在其利润最大化和慈善目标之间创造了潜在的冲突。

其他评估方法包括将 Pi 与 **桌面游戏制造商**（如 Games Workshop）进行比较，因为存在部分客户重叠，或者因为其强大的品牌影响力，将其与 **奢侈品制造商** 进行比较，后一种情况的估值可能达到 8.4 亿美元，以开云集团（拥有古驰品牌）为基准。

Pi 此前的私人融资轮次分别估值为 5.45 亿美元和 5.97 亿美元，而此次 6.3 亿美元的上市为私募股权支持者提供了快速退出的机会。尽管 Pi 的股价仍不确定，但其迷你电脑因其多功能性和经济实惠而闻名。

# How much would you pay for a Pi?

Raspberry Pi, the versatile mini-computer, is considering a **London float** with a potential valuation of $630 million. This valuation is challenging to determine due to Pi's unique characteristics, including its **broad range of applications**, **business model shift**, and **unusual ownership structure**. 

Pi's revenue for 2023 is $265.8 million, a 41% increase, with **EBITDA** nearly doubling to $43.5 million. The average selling price of their computers remains stable at around $43. The company's gross margin was impacted by losing RS Group as a manufacturer, but improved gross profit per unit due to a higher proportion of more expensive boards. 

There are multiple approaches to valuing Pi. One is to compare it to a **widget distributor**, given its previous relationship with RS Group, which has a market cap of £3.9 billion and similar revenue growth to Pi in 2022 due to easing supply chain issues. Another approach is to value it as an **industrial machines maker**, given its focus on business sales and automation, similar to Rotork, a UK-listed company with a valuation of 15 times **EBITDA**. 

Pi could also be valued as a **maker of cheap electronics**, but the UK market lacks comparable consumer electronics companies. A US-based comparison is Vizio, bought by Walmart at a valuation of 15 times 2025 adjusted **EBITDA**, although their hardware is given a stub value. JPMorgan values Vizio's devices division at 0.5 times forward revenue, which would place Pi's valuation at around $150 million. 

An interesting aspect of Pi's valuation is its **public ownership structure**, with a majority of shares held by a **charity focused on introducing children to programming**. This creates a potential conflict between maximizing profit and the charity's objectives. 

Other valuation approaches include comparing Pi to a **tabletop games manufacturer** like Games Workshop, given some customer overlap, or a **luxury goods maker** due to its strong brand, with a potential valuation of $840 million using Kering, owner of Gucci, as a benchmark. 

Pi's previous private funding rounds valued it at $545 million and $597 million, respectively, and the $630 million float offers a quick exit for PE backers. While Pi's stock value remains uncertain, its mini-computers are known for their versatility and affordability.
