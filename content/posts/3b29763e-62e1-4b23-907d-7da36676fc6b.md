# 穆巴达拉公司30亿美元收购 Fortress 交易获美国关键监管机构批准

**穆巴达拉资本**（Mubadala Capital）以 30 亿美元竞标收购 **城堡投资集团**(Fortress Investment Group)多数股权的交易，已获得美国**海外投资委员会（Cfius）**的重要批准，交易接近完成。该交易包括穆巴达拉的一些让步，例如承诺将 **城堡的 数据 和 技术**保留在美国，并放弃对该公司的日常控制权。这项交易意义重大，因为它考验了美国官员对中东基金收购美国投资集团的立场，并反映了资产管理行业整合浪潮。 

**城堡投资集团** 是一家著名的信贷市场和美国铁路基础设施投资者，其出售交易是去年与当前日本所有者 **软银**（SoftBank）达成的。尽管人们对 **阿联酋与中国的关系**有所担忧，但该交易仍在进行中，穆巴达拉同意确保 **数据保护** 和 **城堡投资集团** 的独立性。这与软银在 2017 年收购时达成的协议相似。这笔交易将由 CEO **哈勒敦·穆巴拉克**（Khaldoon al-Mubarak）领导的穆巴达拉推向全球信贷投资者的顶级行列，并突显了主权财富基金与著名的美国投资集团建立联系的趋势。

为解决监管方面的担忧，该交易的结构安排使城堡投资集团员工获得了对董事会以及投资决策和融资的独立控制权。随着时间的推移，城堡投资集团高管甚至可能有机会根据业绩表现重新获得投资业务的多数股权。这项交易凸显了资产管理行业不断变化的格局，大型投资集团和金融机构正在通过战略收购和合作伙伴关系，将其业务从上市市场扩展到私人投资领域。

# Mubadala's $3bn Fortress deal clears crucial US regulatory hurdle 

**Mubadala Capital's** $3 billion bid for a majority stake in **Fortress Investment Group** has received significant approval from the **US Committee on Foreign Investment (Cfius)**, bringing the deal closer to completion. The transaction involves concessions from Mubadala, including a pledge to keep **Fortress' data and technology** within the US and to waive day-to-day control over the company. This deal is notable as it tests US officials' stance on **Middle Eastern funds** acquiring US investment groups and reflects a wave of consolidation in the **asset management industry**. 

/n/n

The sale of **Fortress**, a prominent investor in credit markets and US rail infrastructure, was first agreed upon with current owner **SoftBank** of Japan a year ago. Despite concerns over the **UAE's ties with China**, the deal has progressed with Mubadala agreeing to ensure **data protection** and **independence** for Fortress. This mirrors the arrangement made by SoftBank during its 2017 acquisition. The deal propels Mubadala, led by CEO **Khaldoon al-Mubarak**, into the top ranks of global credit investors and underscores the growing trend of **sovereign wealth funds** forging ties with prominent US investment groups.

The transaction is structured to address regulatory concerns, with Fortress employees gaining control of the board and independence in investment decisions and fundraising. Over time, Fortress executives may even have the opportunity to regain majority ownership of the investment operation, subject to performance. This deal highlights the evolving landscape of the asset management industry, where large investment groups and financial institutions are expanding beyond listed markets and into the realm of private investments through strategic acquisitions and partnerships.
