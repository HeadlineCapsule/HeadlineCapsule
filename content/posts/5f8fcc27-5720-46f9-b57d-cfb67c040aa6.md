# 英国大选在即，保守党人士开始寻找新工作

随着英国大选的临近，保守党和工党都感受到了不确定性和期待。尽管**里希·苏纳克首相**表示选举结果还未定论，但他的部分内阁成员和议员已经在探索其他职业道路，这表明他们对保守党前景缺乏信心。与此同时，工党内部也担心，在长期处于反对党地位后，他们是否为潜在的执政做好了充分准备。关于突然举行大选的传言不断，但具体时间仍不确定。保守党正专注于长期竞选策略，严格审视工党的政策，并强调自身在经济成就和移民政策方面的优势。但在工党内部，各团队的准备程度明显不同，一些团队正在积极制定详细的执政计划，而其他团队则不愿意显得过于自信。**基尔·斯塔默爵士** 的幕僚长**苏·格雷**正在监督确保团队间协调和优先事项设置的工作，但一些工党成员认为这与赢得选举的主要目标不符。随着选举日的临近，双方都在加紧竞选，但保守党能否缩小民意调查中的差距并阻止工党获胜仍有待观察。

# Tories scout for post-election jobs as UK parties dial up campaign mode

With a general election on the horizon in the UK, there is a sense of uncertainty and anticipation among the Conservative and Labour parties. While **Prime Minister Rishi Sunak** maintains that the election result is not a sure thing, some of his ministers and MPs are already exploring alternative career paths, indicating a lack of confidence in the party's prospects. In contrast, there are concerns within the Labour Party about their level of preparedness for potentially assuming power after a long period in opposition. Rumors are swirling about a potential snap election, but the timing remains uncertain. The Conservatives are focusing on a prolonged campaign strategy, scrutinizing Labour's policies, and highlighting their own economic achievements and migration policies. However, there is a noticeable difference in the levels of preparation within the Labour Party, with some teams actively making detailed plans for office while others are hesitant to appear too presumptuous. **Sir Keir Starmer's** chief of staff, **Sue Gray**, is overseeing efforts to ensure cross-team coordination and priority-setting, but some Labour members view this as a distraction from the primary goal of winning the election. As the election date draws closer, both parties are intensifying their campaigns, but it remains to be seen whether the Tories can close the gap in the polls and prevent a Labour victory.
