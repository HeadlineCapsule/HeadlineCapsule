新兴市场货币遭遇2020年以来最差开年表现

**新兴市场货币遭遇202年以来最差开年**
- 摩根大通新兴市场货币指数今年迄今已下跌4.4%，降幅是前几年两倍多。
- 导致这一下滑的因素包括美元意外走强和“带息交易”失败。
- 美国经济韧性与新兴市场经济放缓和扩张财政政策形成对比，导致了当前的局势。
- 智利、匈牙利和巴西等主要新兴市场货币因利率下调和对2024年增长前景的担忧而受到影响。
- 带息交易的解盘，尤其是在墨西哥等大型新兴市场，导致其货币显著走弱。政治变化和即将举行的选举带来的波动性增加也发挥了作用。
- 投资者已将焦点转向尼日利亚和埃及等小经济体，高利率仍使其当地货币债券具有吸引力。
- 韩国韩元、泰国铢和印度尼西亚卢比等亚洲货币因中国经济疲弱而苦恼。
- 美元走强是今年新兴市场疲弱的一个重要因素，投资者现在预计联邦储备的利率下调少于最初预期。

 **Summary:** Emerging Market Currencies Experience Worst Start to Year Since 202nce
- The JPMorgan's emerging markets foreign exchange index has fallen by 4.4% so far in the year, which is more than twice as large a drop compared to previous years.
- Factors contributing to this decline include an unexpectedly strong dollar and unsuccessful 'carry trades.'
- The US economy's resilience contrasted with weakening economies and expansive fiscal policies in emerging markets has led to the current situation.
- Currencies from major emerging markets like Chile, Hungary, and Brazil have been affected due to rate cuts and concerns over growth prospects for 2024.
- The unwinding of carry trades, particularly in larger emerging markets such as Mexico, has caused significant weakness in their currencies. Political changes and increased volatility from upcoming elections also played a role.
- Investors have been shifting focus to smaller economies like Nigeria and Egypt where high interest rates still make local currency bonds attractive.
- Asian currencies such as the South Korean won, Thai baht, and Indonesian rupiah have struggled due to weak Chinese economy impacts.
- The dollar's strength has been a significant factor in emerging market weaknesses this year, with investors now expecting fewer rate cuts by the Federal Reserve than initially anticipated.
