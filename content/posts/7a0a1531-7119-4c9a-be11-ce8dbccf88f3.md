游戏驿站股价大涨，因为咆哮的猫咪声称持有大量股份

**GameStop股价暴涨，“咆哮的猫咪”称其持有大量股票**

视频游戏零售商GameStop的股价出现显著上涨，周一股价跳涨高达75%。这一上涨归功于被称为“咆哮的猫咪”（Roaring Kitty）的基思·吉尔（Keith Gill）的说法。他在2021年备受关注的“迷因股”现象中是一个有影响力的人物。

根据吉尔在Reddit上的DeepFuckingValue账户发布的一篇帖子，截至周一收盘，他已经建立了一笔可观的持股和期权头寸，GameStop股票市值约为2.6亿美元。周日发布的截图显示，吉尔持有500万股股票，平均购买价格为每股21.27美元，截至周一收盘，总价值约为1.4亿美元。此外，该帖子还展示了12万份6月21日到期的看涨期权，周一交易后总价值1.2亿美元。

在2021年的“迷因股”热潮中，吉尔因其社交媒体帖子鼓励数百万人投资GameStop而成为焦点，这给押注该股票下跌的对冲基金带来了压力。在保持了三个月的沉默之后，吉尔在X上再次出现，导致GameStop股价再次上涨，但最终回落。

最近的拉升表明零售交易员对这只股票仍兴趣浓厚，无论其作为投资选择的健康状况如何。截至周五收盘，GameStop约15%的流通股被借出，这是短空比例的一个指标，低于5月底的略高于25%。

GameStop通过上个月股价上涨后出售新股筹集了9.33亿美元，预计将于6月11日发布第一季度业绩。根据5月中旬的公告，初步估计显示，该公司的净销售额同比可能下降约25%。

截至周一早间交易，GameStop的估值超过其未来一年每股收益的2300倍。该公司在早间交易中市值增加近40亿美元，并在社交媒体平台X上受到众多致敬，一些用户称吉尔为“有史以来最伟大的交易员之一”。

 **GameStop Shares Surge Amid Claims by 'Roaring Kittn'**

The stock price for video game retailer GameStop experienced a significant surge, with shares leaping up to 75% on Monday. This increase was attributed to claims made by Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty," who is an influential figure in the meme-stock phenomenon of 2021.

According to a Reddit post from Gill's account, DeepFuckingValue, he has built up a substantial stake and options worth approximately $260 million in GameStop shares by Monday's close. The screenshot posted on Sunday showed that Gill held 5 million shares at an average purchase price of $21.27 each, amounting to around $140 million as of Monday's closing value. Additionally, the post displayed 120,000 call options with a June 21 expiration date and a total worth of $120 million after Monday's trading session.

The meme-stock mania in 2021 saw Gill at its center as his social media posts encouraged millions to invest in GameStop, pressuring hedge funds betting on the stock's decline. After a period of silence lasting three months, Gill reappeared on X, causing another surge in GameStop shares that eventually fizzled out.

The recent rally indicates continued interest among retail traders for this stock, regardless of its health as an investment option. As of Friday's close, approximately 15% of GameStop's outstanding shares were on loan, a proxy for short interest, down from just over 25% at the end of May.

GameStop raised $933 million by selling fresh shares after its stock price surge last month and is expected to report first-quarter results on June 11. Preliminary estimates suggest that net sales may have dropped about 25% year over year, according to mid-May announcements.

As of Monday's premarket trading session, GameStop was valued at more than 2,300 times its estimated earnings per share for the coming year. The company added almost $4 billion to its market value in early trading and received numerous tributes on social media platforms like X, with some users hailing Gill as "one of the greatest traders of all time."
