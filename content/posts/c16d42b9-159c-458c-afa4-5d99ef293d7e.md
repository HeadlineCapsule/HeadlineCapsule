# **乌克兰称俄罗斯向哈尔科夫方向推进了10公里**

**乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基** 承认，**俄罗斯**向**乌克兰**第二大城市哈尔科夫方向推进了10公里，但声称乌克兰军队已成功“稳定”局势并阻止了俄罗斯进一步推进。这一评估是在俄罗斯为期一周的攻势之后做出的，其中包括向哈尔科夫方向发起的新一轮攻势，旨在将资源从东部的主要目标**顿涅茨克**地区引开。乌克兰最高指挥官**亚历山大·西尔斯基将军** 确认，俄罗斯迄今未能突破乌克兰的防御体系，但警告说前方还有艰苦的战斗。与此同时，**俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京** 在访华期间声称，俄罗斯目前没有占领哈尔科夫的计划，尽管他们的军队每天都在向前推进。

乌克兰对俄罗斯发动了大规模的**无人机反击**，出动了100多架空中和海上攻击无人机，针对军事基地、石油仓库和炼油厂。俄罗斯国防部报告称，已在包括**克里米亚**、**克拉斯诺达尔**和**别尔哥罗德**在内的多个地区拦截并摧毁了许多无人机。这些打击行动影响了俄罗斯的基础设施，据报道，**新罗西斯克**的一家炼油厂和海港遭到袭击，导致火灾和停电。根据该地区州长**维亚切斯拉夫·格拉德科夫**的说法，袭击还造成人员伤亡，其中包括别尔哥罗德州的两人死亡。

这种局势使得乌克兰处于一种微妙的平衡之中，一方面要加强哈尔科夫的防御，另一方面又要谨慎行事，避免过度消耗其他地区的兵力。同时，由于**美国**及其盟友担心局势升级和对石油价格的影响，乌克兰使用西方提供的武器打击俄罗斯领土的能力受到限制。**泽连斯基** 对这些限制表示沮丧，强调乌克兰使用西方武器是为了防御，而不是进攻。这场持续不断的冲突继续造成广泛的破坏和生命损失，双方都采用了各种军事策略和战术。

# Russia has advanced 10km towards Kharkiv, says Ukraine 

**Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy** acknowledged that **Russia** has advanced 10 kilometers towards **Kharkiv**, Ukraine's second-largest city, but asserted that Ukrainian forces have managed to "stabilize" the situation and halt the Russian advance. This assessment comes after a week-long offensive by Russia, which included a new push towards Kharkiv, intended to draw resources away from the eastern **Donetsk** region, a key target for Moscow. Ukraine's top commander, **General Oleksandr Syrskyi**, affirmed that Russia has thus far been unable to break through Ukraine's defenses, but cautioned that tough battles lie ahead. Meanwhile, **Russian President Vladimir Putin**, during his visit to China, claimed that Russia currently has no plans to take Kharkiv, despite their troops' daily advancements.

Ukraine has launched a massive **drone counterstrike** on Russia, involving over 100 air and naval attack drones, targeting military bases, oil depots, and refineries. Russia's defense ministry reported intercepting and destroying many drones over various regions, including **Crimea**, **Krasnodar**, and **Belgorod**. The strikes have impacted Russian infrastructure, with reports of an oil refinery and seaport hit in **Novorossiysk**, causing fires and power outages. The attacks have also resulted in casualties, including two deaths in Belgorod, according to the region's governor, **Vyacheslav Gladkov**.

The situation has led to a delicate balance for Ukraine, as it reinforces Kharkiv while being cautious not to overly deplete its forces elsewhere. Meanwhile, Ukraine's ability to strike Russian territory with western-supplied arms is limited by concerns from the **US** and its allies regarding potential escalation and the impact on oil prices. **Zelenskyy** expressed frustration with these constraints, emphasizing that Ukraine's use of western weapons is a matter of defense, not offense. The ongoing conflict continues to cause widespread damage and loss of life, with both sides employing various military strategies and tactics.
