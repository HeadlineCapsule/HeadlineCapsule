# **英美资源**集团需要启动防御，应对**必和必拓**的收购企图

**英美资源集团**（**Anglo American**）是一家拥有多元化商品组合和复杂架构的矿业公司，如今成为关注焦点，因为另一矿业巨头**必和必拓**（BHP）表达了收购意向。在收到提议后，英美资源集团必须制定策略保护自身权益并提升公司价值，解决长期以来其股价较同行折价的问题。

文章探讨了英美资源集团重组尝试和外部兴趣的历史，强调了制定全面计划以释放公司全部潜力的必要性。前首席执行官**马克·库蒂法尼**（Mark Cutifani）曾打算精简公司的业务组合，但由于商品价格波动，这一战略被推翻。公司还曾引起印度富豪**阿尼尔·阿加瓦尔**（Anil Agarwal）的兴趣，他收购了大量股份，但最终没有发起竞标。

英美资源集团复杂的架构，包括其在铂金和铁矿石业务中的股份，以及其对南非的风险敞口，都导致了估值差距。为解决此问题，文章建议英美资源集团考虑剥离其铂金和铁矿石资产，以及表现挣扎的**戴比尔斯**（De Beers）钻石业务，该业务可带来一大笔资金。此外，一个更激进的提议是出售其巴西铁矿，这将产生大量资金，并使公司业务重点进一步转向**铜**等更具吸引力的商品。

在现任首席执行官**邓肯·瓦布拉**（Duncan Wanblad）承诺进行战略审查的背景下，英美资源集团有机会采取果断行动，解决一直困扰其估值的各种问题。该公司现在必须向投资者证明，它致力于进行必要的改变以提升自身价值，并抵御潜在的收购企图。

# Anglo American needs to switch on its defense against BHP

**Anglo American**, a mining company with a diverse commodity portfolio and a convoluted structure, finds itself in the spotlight as **BHP**, another mining giant, has expressed interest in an acquisition. With a proposal on the table, Anglo American must devise a strategy to protect itself and enhance its value, addressing the persistent discount at which it has traded compared to its peers. 

The article delves into Anglo American's history of restructuring attempts and external interest, highlighting the need for a comprehensive plan to unlock the company's full potential. **Mark Cutifani**, former CEO, once intended to streamline the company's portfolio, but shifting commodity prices led to a reversal of this strategy. The company also faced interest from Indian tycoon **Anil Agarwal**, who acquired a significant stake but ultimately did not make a bid. 

Anglo American's complex structure, including its stakes in platinum and iron ore businesses, and its exposure to South Africa, have contributed to a valuation gap. To address this, the article suggests that Anglo American should consider divesting not only its platinum and iron ore assets but also its struggling **De Beers** diamond business, which could fetch a substantial sum. Additionally, a more radical proposal is to sell its Brazilian iron ore mine, which could generate significant funds and further shift the company's focus towards more desirable commodities like **copper**. 

With a promise of a strategic review already made by current CEO **Duncan Wanblad**, Anglo American has an opportunity to take bold action and address the issues that have plagued its valuation. The company must now demonstrate to investors that it is committed to making the necessary changes to enhance its value and defend against potential acquisition attempts.
