# 荷兰右翼政府与布鲁塞尔关系紧张

由 **反伊斯兰强硬派盖尔德·维尔德斯** 领导的 **自由党**（**PVV**）组建了荷兰史上首个右翼领导的政府。这一由四个政党组成的联合政府，包括 **保守自由派VVD**、**中右翼的新社会契约党** 和 **民粹主义的农民-公民运动**，在 **移民**、**能源** 和 **气候政策** 等关键问题上与 **布鲁塞尔** 的政策发生冲突。该联合政府计划取消符合 **欧盟绿色协议** 的政策，如转换为 **电动热泵** 和减少 **氮排放**。他们还打算协商减少农业排放的替代措施，这与荷兰农民有争议。在移民问题上，荷兰政府希望选择退出欧盟政策，但若没有条约的更改和其他成员国的批准，这一举动不太可能成功。该联合政府还计划削减对 **欧盟预算** 的贡献，并可能将荷兰驻以色列大使馆迁至耶路撒冷。该政府面临诸多挑战，包括领导层辩论，维尔德斯拒绝辞去 PVV 领导人职位，以及对政府稳定性的预测。由于其政策与欧盟政策相冲突，荷兰右翼领导的政府前景未卜。

尽管联合政府已经组成，但未来的荷兰政府仍面临一些挑战。四个政党的领袖正在讨论未来首相的人选，因为维尔德斯拒绝辞去 PVV 领袖职位，而这是其他政党参加联合政府的条件。领导层问题可能会导致联合政府内部出现分歧。此外，专家和离任政客都对联合政府的稳定性表示怀疑，称其是一个建立在 "财政 Quicksand 上" 的 "不稳定联合政府"。只有时间能证明这个右翼领导的政府能否克服这些初期障碍，有效执政。

# Dutch Far-Right-Led Government Set for Clashes with Brussels 

The **Freedom Party** (**PVV**), led by **anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders**, has formed the Netherlands' first-ever far-right-led government. The four-party coalition, which includes the **conservative liberal VVD**, the **center-right New Social Contract**, and the **populist Farmer-Citizen Movement**, has agreed on a program that sets it at odds with **Brussels** on key issues such as **migration**, **energy**, and **climate policies**. The coalition plans to roll back policies in line with the **EU Green Deal**, such as the switch to **electric heat pumps** and reducing **nitrogen emissions**. They also intend to negotiate alternative measures to reduce agricultural emissions, a point of contention with Dutch farmers. On migration, the government seeks to opt-out of EU policies, a move that is unlikely to succeed without treaty changes and the approval of other member states. The coalition also plans to cut contributions to the **EU budget** and may move the Dutch embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The government faces challenges, including leadership debates, with Wilders refusing to step down as PVV leader, and predictions of instability. With a program that clashes with EU policies, the Dutch far-right-led government faces an uncertain future. 

/n/n

Despite the formation of the coalition, the future Dutch government still faces some challenges. Leaders of the four parties are debating the name of the future prime minister, as Wilders has refused to step down as PVV leader, a condition set by the other parties for their participation. This leadership question could potentially cause divisions within the coalition. Additionally, experts and outgoing politicians have expressed doubts about the stability of the coalition, calling it a "shaky coalition" built on "financial quicksand." Only time will tell if this far-right-led government can overcome these initial hurdles and govern effectively.
