丹麦首相在哥本哈根市中心广场遭到袭击

# 简要新闻摘要：

文章讨论了丹麦首相梅特·弗雷德里克森（Mette Frederiksen）在哥本哈根市中心广场欧洲选举活动期间遭到袭击的事件。这位中间偏左的总理被一名男子击打后“震惊”，警方已逮捕一名与该事件有关的人员。目前还没有关于袭击情况的详细信息。

## 要点：

1. **丹麦首相梅特·弗雷德里克森** 在哥本哈根的 Kultorvet 广场欧洲选举活动期间遭到袭击。

2. 袭击发生后，这位中间偏左的总理“震惊”，警方逮捕了一名嫌疑人，但没有提供有关该事件情况的进一步信息。

3. 丹麦各政党的政治家谴责了这次袭击，强调暴力行为破坏了公共辩论和民主。

4. 外国领导人也对弗雷德里克森遭到袭击表示关切，瑞典首相乌尔弗·克里斯泰森（Ulf Kristersson）表示：“对民选领袖的攻击也是对我们民主的攻击。”
