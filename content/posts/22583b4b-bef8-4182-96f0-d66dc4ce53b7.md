欧洲推动对国防科技初创企业的投资

# 欧洲国防科技初创企业投资

近年来，欧洲国防科技初创企业的投资显著增加。北约10亿美元风险投资基金的负责人相信，该地区可以产生多个潜在的千亿美元公司，与美国的公司相媲美。这种增长潮流是由地缘政治紧张局势和冲突驱动的，这促使欧洲迅速赶上美国的同行。

北约创新基金今年已经直接支持了四家初创企业，包括总部位于威尔士的Space Forge，该公司计划在太空中生产新型材料。该基金还投资于专注于机器人、人工智能（AI）、太空和能源等深科技领域的风险投资基金。

北约创新基金旨在解决传统风险投资公司未能投资于雄心勃勃的长期技术项目的“市场失败”问题。该基金的投资周期超过15年，而大多数风险投资公司必须在10年内归还资金。这为深科技初创企业提供了更长、更集中的研发周期。

总部位于荷兰的北约创新基金还支持了ARX Robotics（德国）、Fractile AI（伦敦）和iCOMAT（布里斯托尔大学孵化器）。该基金投资于开发可用于商业和国防应用双重用途技术的公司。

欧洲很快就会拥有一个本土公司，与美国的Anduril公司相媲美，Anduril是一家新兴的人工智能和机器人公司，估值70亿美元。乌克兰战争和政府对无人机、网络安全和人工智能等具有广泛应用能力的投资，激发了欧洲发展双重用途技术的热情。

欧洲投资银行取消了获得其资金的双重用途科技公司的民用应用最低收入门槛，从而为国防科技公司提供了更多交易机会。这一变化帮助改变了人们对投资国防公司的看法，因为这些公司以前由于环境、社会和治理规则而被视为高风险。

采购流程中的“文化转变”也加速了欧洲国防科技公司的投资。乌克兰战争表明，技术的采用和实验可以比以前更快地进行。最近的投资者包括General Catalyst、Spotify创始人Daniel Ek的Prima Materia和Air Street Capital。

北约创新基金计划在政府技术买家和生物技术、通信、安全和量子计算等领域开发新型产品的初创企业之间发挥“红娘”的作用。该基金的使命是投资于增强北约盟友公民安全并保持北约技术优势的颠覆性技术。

 **Europe's Defence Tech Start-Up Investment**

In recent years, Europe has seen a significant increase in investments within defence technology start-ups. The head of NATO's €1bn venture capital fund believes that the region can produce several potential multibillnion-dollar companies to rival those in the US. This surge is driven by geopolitical tensions and conflicts, which have pushed Europe to catch up fast with its American counterparts.

The Nato Innovation Fund has already backed four start-ups directly this year, including Wales-based Space Forge that plans to produce novel materials in space. The fund also invested in VC funds focusing on deep tech areas such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), space and energy.

The Nato Innovation Fund aims to address the "market failure" where traditional venture capital firms fail to invest in ambitious, long-term technology projects. The fund invests over 15 years, contrasting with most VCs that have to return their funds within 10 years. This allows for longer and more intensive research & development cycles required by deep tech startups.

The Netherlands-based Nato Innovation Fund has also backed ARX Robotics (Germany), Fractile AI (London) and iCOMAT (University of Bristol spinout). The fund invests in companies that develop dual-use technology, which can be applied to both commercial and defence applications.

Europe could soon have a homegrown rival to US company Anduril, an emerging leader in AI and robotics with a $7bn valuation. Europe's enthusiasm for building such dual-use technology has been fueled by the war in Ukraine and government investments into capabilities like drones, cybersecurity, and AI that have broader applications.

The European Investment Bank opened the door to more deals in defence tech companies by removing a minimum threshold of revenues from civilian applications for dual-use tech companies receiving its funds. This change has helped alter perceptions of investing in defence companies, which were previously seen as risky due to environmental, social and governance rules.

A "cultural shift" in procurement processes is also accelerating investments into European defense tech companies. The war in Ukraine demonstrated that technology adoption and experimentation can occur at a much faster pace than before. Recent investors include General Catalyst, Spotify founder Daniel Ek's Prima Materia, and Air Street Capital.

The Nato Innovation Fund plans to act as a "matchmaker" between government buyers of technology and start-ups developing novel products in areas such as biotech, communications, security, and quantum computing. The fund's mission is to invest in disruptive technology that enhances the safety of NATO allies' citizens and maintains NATO's technological edge.
