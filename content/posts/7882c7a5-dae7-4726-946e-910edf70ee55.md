# 迪士尼股价下跌 9.5%，尽管核心流媒体业务首次实现盈利

迪士尼股价在周二大幅下跌 **9.5%**，尽管该公司流媒体业务取得了显著里程碑。截止到三月的季度业绩显示，Disney+ 和 **Hulu** 流媒体部门首次实现营业利润 4700 万美元，较去年同期亏损 5.87 亿美元实现了显著扭转。这要归功于有效的 **削减成本** 措施以及《将军大人》（Shogun）和《厨师》（The Bear）等 Hulu 节目的人气。

然而，投资者似乎更关注主题公园部门可能出现 **放缓** 的迹象，该部门在疫情后复苏强劲。迪士尼首席执行官 **鲍勃·查佩克**（Bob Chapek）强调了流媒体和体验部门的积极季度业绩，其中上海迪士尼等国际主题公园推动了增长。

在面向投资者的电话会议上，迪士尼首席财务官 **休·约翰斯顿**（Hugh Johnston）将潜在放缓归因于新邮轮带来的较高费用以及疫情后旅游需求可能的放缓。这一消息令投资者感到担忧，他们一直依赖主题公园业务的持续复苏。

流媒体业务历来亏损严重，但由于迪士尼削减成本和提高价格的战略决策，该业务现已走上盈利之路。本季度的业绩也展示了该公司良好的财务状况，调整后每股收益为 1.21 美元，超出了华尔街的预期。

展望未来，迪士尼预计流媒体盈利能力将进一步改善，预计综合流媒体业务将在第四季度实现盈利。这一乐观前景是在 **查佩克** 成功应对代理权争夺之后出现的，增强了人们对该公司扭亏为盈和增长战略的信心。

随着迪士尼继续在娱乐业领域航行，提高流媒体盈利能力和提供高质量内容仍是关键优先事项，其电影工作室即将推出的影片有望推动其持续成功。

# Disney shares fall 9.5% despite first profit in core streaming business 

**Disney's** shares experienced a significant drop of 9.5% on Tuesday, despite the company achieving a notable milestone in its streaming business. The quarter ending in March saw the Disney+ and **Hulu** streaming unit turn its first operating profit of $47 million, a remarkable turnaround from the previous year's loss of $587 million. This success can be attributed to effective **cost-cutting measures** and the popularity of Hulu programs such as "Shogun" and "The Bear." 

However, investors' attention seemed to be focused on potential signs of a **slowdown** in the theme parks division, which has been a strong performer in the post-pandemic recovery. **Bob Iger**, **Disney's** chief executive, emphasized the positive quarterly results in streaming and the experiences division, with international theme parks like Shanghai Disney contributing to the growth. 

In a call with investors, **Hugh Johnston**, Disney’s chief financial officer, attributed the potential slowdown to higher expenses from new cruise ships and a possible moderation in post-pandemic travel demand. This message was a concern for investors who had been relying on the sustained recovery of the theme parks business. 

The streaming business, which has historically incurred significant losses, is now on a path to profitability due to Disney's strategic decisions to cut costs and raise prices. This quarter's results also showcased the company's overall financial health, with adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share, exceeding Wall Street expectations. 

Looking ahead, Disney expects further improvements in streaming profitability and anticipates that the combined streaming business will be profitable in the fourth quarter. This positive outlook comes after **Iger's** successful defense against a proxy challenge, reinforcing the confidence in the company's turnaround and growth strategies. 

As Disney continues to navigate the entertainment landscape, the focus on enhancing streaming profitability and delivering high-quality content remains a key priority, with upcoming releases from its film studios expected to contribute to its ongoing success.
