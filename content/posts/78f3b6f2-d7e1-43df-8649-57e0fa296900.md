市场预期减产将继续，OPEC+ 转向线上会议

# 欧佩克+决定从面对面部长级会议转向6月2日的在线会议，届时他们将决定2023年下半年的生产政策。由于担心美国产量和中国经济前景，该集团预计将延长现有的石油减产。这些自愿减产加上之前的减产，导致全球供应大幅减少。

**欧佩克+** 取消了下周在维也纳的正式会议，转而举行视频会议，表明成员国广泛同意延长现有的石油产量配额。该集团现在将于6月2日在线会面，决定今年下半年的生产政策。大多数分析师预计，由于试图在更高的美国产量和中国不确定的经济前景面前支撑价格，欧佩克的成员将延长到6月底到期的**220万桶**的自愿减产。

## 有趣的问题：

Q1：有哪些因素促使欧佩克+从面对面会议转向虚拟会议？
A1：这篇文章表明，这种转变可能是由于对88岁的沙特阿拉伯国王萨勒曼的健康状况的担忧，以及在新冠疫情期间在线会议的以往经验。此外，还提到与去年11月非洲成员就配额发生争端相比，这次讨论预计会更加顺利。

Q2：欧佩克+的产量削减对全球石油供应和价格有何影响？
A2：**220万桶**的自愿减产加上现有的360万桶/日的生产限制，自2022年11月以来，该集团的原油产量减少了约**580万桶/日**，约占全球供应的5%。这些削减在过去18个月中帮助支撑了原油价格，但同时也让沙特阿拉伯承担了大部分成本，使其产量减少了200万桶/日。

Q3：欧佩克+即将举行的会议的生产政策决定可能有哪些潜在结果？
A3：分析师预计，欧佩克+可能会延长现有的石油产量配额，以试图在更高的美国产量和中国不确定的经济前景面前支撑价格。此外，该集团可能会在6月底对成员国的基准生产能力进行审查，然后为2025年的基准做出进一步的决定。

## Summary:
Opec+ has decided to switch from an in-person ministerial gathering to an online meeting on June 2, where they will decide production policy for the second half of the2023. The group is expected to roll over existing oil production cuts due to concerns about US production and China's economic outlook. These voluntary cuts add to previous reductions, resulting in a significant decrease in global supply.

**Opec+** has cancelled its formal meeting in Vienna next week in favour of a video conference, indicating broad agreement for members to roll over existing oil production cuts. The group will now meet online on June 2 to decide production policy for the second half of the year. Most analysts expect Opec's members to extend a voluntary cut of **2.2mn barrels** due to expire at the end of June, as they try to shore up prices against higher US production and an uncertain economic outlook in China.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What factors are contributing to Opec+'s decision to switch from an in-person meeting to a virtual one?
A1: The article suggests that the shift may be due to concerns over the health of 88-year-old King Salman of Saudi Arabia, as well as previous experiences with online meetings during the Covid pandemic. Additionally, it is mentioned that discussions are predicted to be smoother this time around compared to last November's disputes among African members about quotas.

Q2: How have Opec+'s production cuts impacted global oil supply and prices?
A2: The voluntary cut of 2.2mn barrels, added to the existing 3.6mn b/d of production curbs, has reduced the group's crude output by about **5.8mn barrels a day** or approximately 5% of global supply since November 2022. These cuts have helped support crude prices in the past 18 months but left Saudi Arabia shouldering most of the cost, reducing its output by 2mn barrels a day.

Q3: What are some potential outcomes for Opec+'s production policy decisions at their upcoming meeting?
A3: Analysts expect that Opec+ will likely roll over existing oil production cuts to try and shore up prices against higher US production and an uncertain economic outlook in China. Additionally, the group may conduct a review of members' baseline production capacity at the end of June before making further decaturations for 2025 benchmarks.
