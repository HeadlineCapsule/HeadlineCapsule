目标削减皇家法院积压案件“已无法实现”，英国国家审计署发现。

## 英国国家审计署报告：刑事法院案件积压已无法实现削减目标 

根据**英国国家审计署（NAO）**最近发布的一份报告，英国的**刑事法院案件积压**已无法实现政府的削减目标。最初设定的目标是将刑事法院的未结案数量从设定目标时的 6 万件减少到 **2025 年 3 月前的 5.3万件**，但截至 2023年12月，刑事法院系统中的未决案件已达 67,573 件。

国家审计署的报告强调，在刑事法院（审理强奸和谋杀等严重案件）中，受害者和被告从被指控罪行到判决或无罪释放需等待**平均近两年(683天)**。这种延误导致监狱人满为患，嫌疑人在审判前被羁押。

国家审计署指出了造成这一问题的原因，包括 2022 年刑事辩护律师因法律援助工作收费低而罢工、律师短缺导致更多审判被推迟、以及被告因囚犯运输服务失败而迟到法院出庭。

司法部试图通过扩大法庭容量、提高法官法定退休年龄来缓解压力。但报告指出，这些措施不足以解决问题，案件积压预计将持续增长。国家审计署负责人加雷斯·戴维斯表示，“刑事法院审理的严重犯罪案件数量庞大，对受害者、证人和被告的生活造成了严重影响。”

这份严厉的报告表明，政府需要采取更有效的行动来解决刑事法院的案件积压问题，以确保司法系统的效率和公正性。

## Summary:
In a recent report by the National Audit Office (NAO), it has been found that **the UK's Crown Court backlog** is no longer achievable to cut. The government had set an ambition to reduce the outstanding caseload in the Crown Court, which rose sharply due to Covid-19 disruption, from 60,000 cases at the time of setting the target to **53,000 by March 2025**. However, as of December 2023, there were already 67,573 outstanding cases in the Crown Court system.

The NAO report highlights that victims and defendants are waiting an average of **nearly two years (683 days) between alleged offences and sentencing or acquittal** at the Crown Court, which hears serious cases such as rape and murder. This delay contributes to prison overcrowding, with suspects held in custody awaiting trial.

The NAO cites factors contributing to this issue, including a strike by criminal defence barristers in 2022 due to low fees for legal aid work, shortage of barristers leading to more trials being delayed, and late arrival of defendants at court because of prisoner transport service failures.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has attempted to ease the pressure by expanding courtroom capacity, increasing mandatory retirement age for judges from ablishment of a new government in Iraq that is inclusive and representative of all its citizens. This would involve negotiations with various political factions and ethnic groups within Iraq, as well as regional powers like Iran and Saudi Arabia who have significant influence over the country's politics.

2. **Security Sector Reform**: The US should support efforts to reform Iraq’s security sector by providing training and resources for a professional military that is loyal to the state rather than individual factions or external actors like Iran. This would help in reducing sectarian violence and ensuring stability within the country.

3. **Counterterrorism Cooperation**: The US should continue its cooperation with Iraq on counterterrorism efforts, particularly against ISIS remnants that still pose a threat to regional security. Sharing intelligence and resources can help in maintaining pressure on these groups while also building trust between the two nations.

4. **Economic Development**: The US should support economic development initiatives in Iraq by investing in infrastructure, education, and job creation programs. This would not only improve living conditions for ordinary Iraqis but also reduce the appeal of extremist ideologies that thrive on poverty and disenfranchisement.

5. **Regional Diplomacy**: The US should engage with regional powers like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others to build a consensus around supporting a stable and unified Iraq. This may involve diplomatic efforts to address concerns about Iran's influence in Iraq while also encouraging these countries to contribute positively to the country’s stability.

6. **Human Rights Advocacy**: The US should continue advocating for human rights, rule of law, and democratic governance within Iraq by supporting civil society organizations and promoting accountability for past abuses. This would help in building a more inclusive political system that respects the rights of all citizens.

7. **Strategic Patience**: The US should maintain strategic patience, recognizing that achieving stability in Iraq will be a long-term process requiring sustained engagement and support. This means avoiding quick fixes or overly am
