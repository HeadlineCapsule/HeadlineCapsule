前欧洲投资银行行长维尔纳·霍耶因欧盟腐败调查而辞职

一位前欧洲投资银行（EIB）行长Werner Hoyer目前正在接受欧盟反腐败调查，被指控滥用职权和挪用资金。由欧洲公共检察官办公室主导的调查重点关注一项对即将离任的EIB员工的补偿支付，该支付得到了Hoyer的批准。

Hoyer将这些指控描述为“荒谬和毫无根据”，并充分配合调查。这位德国经济学家还要求放弃他的豁免权，以便进一步澄清对他提出的指控。EIB取消了两名前雇员的豁免权，使他们能够与Hoyer一起接受调查。

欧洲公共检察官办公室设在卢森堡，自2021年开始运作以来发起了这一高调案件。该调查旨在收集所有必要证据，充分揭示调查事实，无论是定罪还是无罪。

在2012年至2020年担任EIB行长期间，Hoyer带领银行度过了欧元区债务危机的后果，并将银行定位为专注于气候行动的领先多边贷款机构。他坚决维护该机构的最高信用评级，同时不愿意在应对新冠疫情或俄罗斯入侵乌克兰等危机时承诺其全部财务火力。

EIB表示，它将在此案上与欧洲公共检察官办公室充分合作，允许他们进入其场所和档案进行证据收集。

 A **former European Investment Bank (EIB) president**, Werner Hoyer, is currently under an EU corruption investigation for allegations of abuse of influence and misappropriation of funds. The probe, led by the European Public Prosecutor's Office, focuses on a compensation payment made to a departing EIB staff member that Hoyer signed off on.

Hoyer has described these accusations as "absurd and unfounded" while cooperating fully with the investigation. The German economist also requested his immunity be waived for further clarification of the allegations against him. Two former employees' immunities have been lifted by the EIB, allowing them to be investigated alongside Hoyer.

The European Public Prosecutor's Office is based in Luxembourg and has initiated this high-profile case since its operations began in 2021. The probe aims to gather all evidence needed to shed full light on the facts under investigation, whether incriminating or exonerating.

During his tenure as EIB president from 2012 to 2020, Hoyer steered the bank through the aftermath of the Eurozone debt crisis and positioned it as a leading multilateral lender focused on climate action. He fiercely guarded the institution's top credit rating while being reluctant to commit its full financial firepower in response to crises such as Covid-19 or Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The EIB has stated that it will fully cooperate with the European Public Prosecutor's Office on this matter, allowing them access to their premises and archives for evidence gathering purposes.
