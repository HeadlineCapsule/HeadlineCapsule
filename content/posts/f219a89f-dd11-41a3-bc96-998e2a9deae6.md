# 中国被指控“跨国镇压”留学生 

**大赦国际发布报告**称，**中国当局正在进行跨国镇压**，针对在欧洲和美国大学就读的中国留学生进行骚扰和恐吓。该报告揭示，留学生们遭受了恐吓和监视，导致自我审查和恐惧氛围。**证词**描述了在抗议活动中被**拍照**、在社交媒体上被**跟踪**，以及从中国国内的**家人**那里收到**警告**。这导致留学生们焦虑和孤立，他们避免与华人同学互动，害怕被举报。 

大学领导和各国政府就此展开讨论，寻求有效保护留学生和维护**学术自由**的方法。尽管已经采取了一些措施，例如**不记录讲座内容以鼓励公开讨论**，但大赦国际的报告认为这些努力可能还不够。人权观察和自由之家等倡导组织也呼吁采取更强有力的行动，以保护海外留学生免受此类干预。**北京否认了这些指控**，称该报告“主观且具有误导性”。与此同时，英国和美国等留学生所在国政府承诺将解决这一问题，计划与大学合作，并授予必要的警方权力，以确保校园内所有学生的安全和言论自由。

# China accused of 'transnational repression' of students 

**Amnesty International has released a report** alleging that **Chinese authorities are engaging in transnational repression**, targeting and harassing Chinese students enrolled in European and American universities. The report reveals that students are experiencing intimidation and surveillance, leading to self-censorship and a climate of fear. **Testimonies** describe being **photographed at protests**, **tracked on social media**, and receiving **warnings from family members back in China**. This has resulted in anxiety and isolation, with students avoiding interactions with their Chinese peers for fear of being reported on.

The report has prompted discussions among university leaders and governments about how to effectively protect these students and uphold **academic freedom**. While some measures have been implemented, such as **not recording lectures to encourage open discussion**, the Amnesty report suggests that these efforts may not be sufficient. Advocacy groups like Human Rights Watch and Freedom House have also called for stronger actions to safeguard overseas students from such interference. **Beijing has denied the allegations**, accusing the report of being "subjective and misleading." Meanwhile, governments in host countries, such as the UK and the US, have vowed to address the issue, with plans to collaborate with universities and provide necessary police powers to ensure the safety and freedom of speech for all students on campus.
