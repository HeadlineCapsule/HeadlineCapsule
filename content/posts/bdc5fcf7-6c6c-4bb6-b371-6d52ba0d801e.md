美国百万富翁支持对超级富人征税，民调显示

# 多数美国百万富翁支持对超级富人征收更高税率

最近由爱国百万富翁委托进行的YouGov民意调查显示，大多数美国百万富翁支持乔·拜登的计划，即作为其进步经济战略的一部分，在连任时对超级富人征收更高的税率。该调查发现，近60%的受访者赞成对超过100万美元的收入征收更高的边缘税率，高于目前的顶级税率37%。

民意调查还突显了人们对不断加剧的不平等现象的担忧，有60%以上的人将其视为对民主的威胁，91%以上的人认为极端财富使一些公民能够购买政治影响力。此外，四分之三的人认为富人可以利用平均纳税人无法获得的税收漏洞。

拜登的经济议程包括将最高边缘所得税率提高到39.6%，不仅针对亿万富翁，也针对单身申报人收入超过40万美元以及已婚夫妇收入超过45万美元的家庭。相比之下，共和党总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普旨在续签有利于富人的2017年税收减免。

YouGov民意调查还显示，百万富翁支持在全球合作中防止亿万富翁通过搬迁来逃避更高税率，并支持在G20会议上提议的2%征税。然而，美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦拒绝支持该全球征税方案的现行形式。

## 关键要点：
- 多数美国百万富翁支持乔·拜登的计划，即对超级富人征收更高税率。
- 对极端财富导致的政治影响力和不断加剧的不平等现象表示担忧。
- 拜登提议将最高边缘所得税率提高到39.6%。
- 唐纳德·特朗普旨在续签有利于富人的2017年税收减免。
- 尽管珍妮特·耶伦反对，但支持在全球合作中防止亿万富翁逃避更高税率，并支持在G20会议上提议的2%征税。

 **Article Summary:**  
A recent YouGov poll commissioned by Patriotic Millionaires revealed that a majority of US millionaires support Joe Biden's plan to tax super-wealthy individuals more heavily, as part of his progressive economic strategy for re-election. The survey found that nearly 60% of respondents favored higher marginal rates on income tax above $100mn compared to the current top rate of amoeba37%.

The poll also highlighted concerns about rising inequality, with over 60% viewing it as a threat to democracy and more than 91% agreeing that extreme wealth allows some citizens to buy political influence. Additionally, three-quarters believed the wealthy had access to tax loopholes unavailable to average taxpayers.

Biden's economic agenda includes raising the highest marginal rate on income tax to 39.6%, targeting not only billionaires but also households with incomes above $400,000 for single filers and $450,000 for married couples. In contrast, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump aims to renew the 2017 tax cuts that benefit the wealthy.

The YouGov poll also showed support among millionaires for global cooperation in preventing billionaires from avoiding higher taxes by moving countries and backing a proposed 2% levy on G20 meetings. However, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has ruled out supporting the global levy in its current form.

**Key Points:**  
- Majority of US millionaires support Joe Biden's plan to tax super-wealthy more heavily.

- Biden proposes raising highest marginal rate on income tax to 39.6%.
- Trump aims to renew the 2017 tax cuts benefiting the wealthy.
