国家电网的“轻松”现金调用背后的权力游戏

该文章讨论了国家电网公司进行的一项权利发行交易，尽管巴克莱银行和摩根大通银行不是分销商，但它们被选定为首席承销商。作者质疑为什么国家电网公司选择将其他核心关系银行排除在外，而是青睐他们的企业经纪人并获得全额费用。

文章提出了一些可能导致这一决定的原因：

1. 企业经纪实践：在英国，公司任命两家银行作为企业经纪人，他们不收取费用，希望在未来获得并购或资本市场授权。这些关系被认为是“被束缚的”，可能会影响国家电网公司青睐巴克莱银行和摩根大通银行的决定。

2. 实际考虑：权利发行突然宣布，因此国家电网公司可能不想冒险泄密或在公告后立即提供承销券来分散其内部团队的注意力。这可以解释为什么他们选择与已经熟悉交易并可以接触尽职调查材料的两家企业经纪人合作。

3. 信任顾问：作者指出，国家电网公司奖励值得信赖的顾问而不是贷款银行，这令人耳目一新，这可能促成了他们青睐巴克莱银行和摩根大通银行的决定。

4. 费用结构：交易的费用结构为1.85%的基本费用加上0.15%的激励费用。尽管这大致符合英国的做法，但国家电网公司本可以谈判一个较低的利率，因为巴克莱银行和摩根大通银行获得了全部的经济利益和联赛表格信贷。

作者最后提出，交易的真正技能不在于承销，而在于说服国家电网公司支付全额费用并排除其他核心关系银行，这可能是在巴克莱银行和摩根大通银行方面的战略举措。

The article discusses a rights issue conducted by National Grid, where Barclays and JPMorgan were chosen as lead underwriters despite not being sub-underwriters. The author questions why National Grid chose to exclude other core relationship banks from the deal and instead favored their corporate brokers with full fees.

The article suggests that there may be several reasons for this decision:

1. Corporate Broking Practice: In the UK, companies appoint two banks as corporate brokers who work without charging a fee in hopes of securing future M&A or capital markets mandates. These relationships are considered "captive" and may have influenced National Grid's decision to favor Barclays and JPMorgan.
2. Practical Considerations: The rights issue was announced suddenly, so National Grid might not have wanted to risk a leak or distract their internal teams by offering underwriting tickets immediately post-announcement. This could explain why they chose to work with the two corporate brokers who were already familiar with the deal and had access to due diligence materials.
3. Trusting Advisors: The author notes that it's refreshing for National Grid to reward trusted advisors over lending banks, which may have contributed to their decision to favor Barclays and JPMorgan.
4. Fee Structure: The fee structure of the deal was 1.85% base fee plus an incentive fee of 0.15%. While this is roughly in line with UK practice, National Grid could've potentially negotiated a lower rate given that Barclays and JPMorgan were handed full economics and league table credit.

The author concludes by suggesting that the real skill in the deal lay not in underwriting it but rather in persuading National Grid to pay full fees and exclude other core relationship banks, which may have been a strategic move on Barclays' and JPMorgan's part.
