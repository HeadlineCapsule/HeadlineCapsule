股市最后冲刺引发市场集中化担忧

# 新闻摘要：

文章讨论了人们对美国和欧洲股市收盘拍卖期间交易活动增加的担忧，最近这一活动达到了创纪录的水平。这种增长归因于交易所交易基金（ETF）和被指数闭幕作为基准的被动投资策略的流行。

## 要点：

1. **收盘拍卖交易创纪录**：在今年第一季度，欧盟股票交易的29%发生在收盘拍卖期间（比去年同期的22.5%有所增加），美国股票交易的19%发生在收盘拍卖期间（比去年同期的12.5%有所增加）。

2. **集中风险**：收盘拍卖期间剧烈的活动引发了对证券交易所在故障或停机时脆弱性的担忧，这可能会影响价格形成和市场稳定。

3. **对主动基金经理的影响**：交易最后几分钟的增加使主动基金经理能够在高速交易员无法在常规交易小时发现的情况下移动大宗股票。

4. **停机担忧**：高管们担心像2020年10月欧股交易所发生的那样的中断，尤其是在主要指数重新平衡的日子里（例如，MSCI的指数重新平衡导致欧洲股票交易的68%和美国股票交易的43%在收盘时发生）。

5. **监管反应**：英国金融行为监管局和欧洲证券市场管理局等监管机构正在监控情况，评估场外交易所应该如何管理中断及其对价格形成的影响。

6. **流动性转移**：收盘拍卖期间交易活动增加导致流动性集中在交易日结束时，导致常规交易时段的成交量变薄，并可能影响日内波动率和波动性。

 **Article Summary:**

The article discusses concerns over increased trading activity during stock market closing auctions in both the US and Europe, which has reached record levels recently. This surge is attributed to the popularity of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and passive investing strategies that are benchmarked against index closures.

**Key Points:**

1. **Record Levels of Trading in Closing Auctions:** In Q1, 29% of daily EU equities trading occurred during closing auctions (up from 22.5% in the same period last year), and 19% of US share trading took place at closing auctions (up from 12.5%).

2. **Concentration Risk:** The intense bursts of activity during closing auctions raise concerns about stock exchanges' vulnerability to malfunctions or outages, potentially impacting price formation and market stability.

3. **Impact on Active Fund Managers:** Increased trading in the final minutes allows active fund managers to move large blocks of shares without detection by high-speed traders during regular trading hours.

4. **Outage Concerns:** Executives are worried about outages, like the one that occurred with Euronext in October 2020, particularly on days when major indices are rebalanced (e.g., MSCI's index rebalancing led to 68% of European equities and amo43% of US equities trading at close).

5. **Regulatory Response:** Regulators like the UK's Financial Conduct Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority are monitoring the situation, assessing how venues should manage outages and their impact on price formation.

6. **Liquidity Shift:** The heightened activity during closing auctions is causing liquidity to be concentrated at the end of the trading day, leading to thinner volumes throughout regular hours and potentially affecting intraday spreads and volatility.
