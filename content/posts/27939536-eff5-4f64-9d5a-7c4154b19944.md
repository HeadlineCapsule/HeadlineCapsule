报告称，实现碳中和至少需要10万亿美元的保险保障

**新报告强调需要10万亿美元的保险来支持净零过渡**

保险经纪公司Howden和波士顿咨询集团（BCG）最近的一份报告强调，需要至少10万亿美元的新保险来支持超过一半的已承诺的**19万亿美元投资**，以实现向净零排放的过渡。从2020年到2030年，需要这一保险覆盖的行业包括能源、道路运输和建筑业。

该报告确定了将需要大量保险覆盖的大型基础设施项目，例如离岸风力农场、太阳能发电厂以及现有住房库存的绝缘。霍登气候团队首席执行官罗旺·道格拉斯（Rowan Douglas）将这一要求描述为行业的“唤醒呼声”，以认识到其在面对前所未有的结构性压力时促进能源过渡的关键作用。

该报告还承认，虽然保险公司已经为氢动力和电动汽车、离岸风能和混合建筑材料等新兴技术提供了额外的保险，但需要扩大到具有有限历史损失数据的新领域。这给与创新能源技术相关的风险的承保带来了挑战，由于其新颖性和风险性，这些技术更难评估。

保险公司正在与绿色能源团体密切合作，以减轻新项目的风险，例如在恶劣天气时调整太阳能电池板的位置。然而，BCG的董事总经理拉斐尔·特洛伊施（Raphael Troitzsch）并不预计到2030年会大幅减少对化石燃料项目的保险覆盖，这将为支持绿色倡议腾出空间。

该报告还强调了自然灾害保险需求的增加是导致该行业压力另一个因素。随着气候变化继续影响商业、市场和政治，保险覆盖将在支持向净零排放过渡方面发挥关键作用。

 **New Report Highlights $10tn Insurance Cover Needed for Net Zero Transition**  

A recent report by insurance broker Howden and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) emphasizes the need for at least $10tn of new insurance cover to support over half of the committed **$19tn investment** in transitioning towards net zero. The sectors requiring this coverage include energy, road transport, and building industries from 202amo to 203o.

The report identifies significant infrastructure projects such as offshore wind farms, solar power plants, and the insulation of existing housing stocks that will require substantial insurance cover. Howden's climate team chief executive Rowan Douglas described this requirement as a "wake-up call" for the industry to recognize its crucial role in facilitating the energy transition amidst unprecedented structural pressures.

The report also acknowledges that while insurers are already providing extra coverage for emerging technologies like hydrogen-powered and electric vehicles, offshore wind, and hybrid building materials, there is a need to expand into newer areas with limited historical data on losses. This poses challenges in underwriting risks associated with innovative energy technologies that are harder to assess due to their novelty and riskiness.

Insurers are collaborating closely with green energy groups to mitigate the risks of new projects, such as adjusting solar panel positions during adverse weather conditions. However, BCG's managing director Raphael Troitzsch does not anticipate a significant reduction in insurance coverage for fossil fuel projects by 203o, which would free up capacity to support green initiatives.

The report also highlights the increasing demand for natural disaster cover as another factor contributing to pressure on the sector. As climate change continues to intersect with business, markets, and politics, insurance coverage will play a pivotal role in supporting the transition towards net zero emissions.
