# 印度航空面临虫患和员工罢工，塔塔集团重组任重道远

**印度航空**（**Air India**），作为印度的**国家航空公司**，正面临一系列挑战，考验着**塔塔集团**（Tata Group）对其重组计划的雄心。近日，空乘人员的罢工事件导致近 200 架航班中断，这吸引了人们对该航空公司所面临问题的关注，该公司目前正处于**合并**和**现代化**转型过程之中，由塔塔集团管理。这场劳资纠纷凸显了员工不满可能成为该集团航空雄心的阿喀琉斯之踵。

塔塔集团两年前以 24 亿美元的价格收购了印度航空，目前正将其与**维斯塔拉航空**（Vistara，与**新加坡航空**共同拥有的**优质航空公司**）合并。然而，该集团的航空公司目前仅占有印度国内航空旅行市场不到 30% 的份额，**靛蓝航空**（IndiGo）则主导着国内客运流量，并在国际上迅速扩张。为了扭转局势，塔塔集团任命了经验丰富的的航空业高管**坎贝尔·威尔逊**（Campbell Wilson）来领导转型。威尔逊的目标是将乘客人数增加两倍，并与海湾枢纽竞争转机交通。

威尔逊的关键战略之一是去年下单订购 470 架喷气式飞机，这是该行业有史以来最大的订单之一，旨在升级印度航空老旧的机队。然而，交付延误和供应短缺可能会阻碍这些计划。除了机队现代化之外，印度航空还致力于用新的 IT 系统取代人工纸质流程，并引入由宝莱坞时尚设计师**曼尼什·马赫洛特拉**（Manish Malhotra）设计的新制服。

尽管做出了这些努力，但印度航空的声誉最近还是因几起事件而受损，包括机舱内出现**虫害**和**害虫**的投诉，以及一名 80 岁乘客因轮椅短缺而死亡。这些问题，再加上员工的不满，影响了航空公司的转型计划。该集团引入了新的薪资结构，并将员工平均年龄降低至 35 岁，但管理员工的不满情绪，尤其是引入绩效制合同带来的不满，仍然是一个关键挑战。

随着印度国内航空市场的迅速增长和政府将该国定位为全球航空枢纽的野心，成功改革印度航空具有重要意义。然而，这预计将是一个漫长的过程，分析人士预测，解决服务问题和与员工谈判可能需要长达两年的时间。

# Vermin on planes and staff walkouts: Air India’s woes build as Tata pursues overhaul

**Air India**, the **flag carrier** of India, has been facing a series of challenges that are testing the **Tata Group's** plans for its overhaul. The recent walkout by cabin crew, which disrupted nearly 200 flights, has brought attention to the issues facing the airline as it undergoes a **merger** and **modernization** process under Tata's management. This labor dispute highlights the potential for staff discontent to become the "Achilles heel" of the conglomerate's aviation ambitions. 

The Tata Group acquired Air India in a $2.4 billion deal two years ago and is in the process of merging it with **Vistara**, a **premium carrier** co-owned with **Singapore Airlines**. However, the group's carriers currently hold less than 30% of India's domestic air travel market, with **IndiGo** dominating domestic passenger traffic and rapidly expanding internationally. To turn things around, Tata has appointed **Campbell Wilson**, a seasoned aviation executive, to lead the transformation. Wilson aims to triple passenger numbers and compete with Gulf hubs for layover traffic. 

One of Wilson's key strategies is the massive order of 470 jets last year, one of the industry's largest, to upgrade Air India's aging fleet. However, delivery delays and supply shortages may hinder these plans. In addition to modernizing its fleet, Air India is also working on replacing manual, paper-based processes with a new IT system and introducing new uniforms designed by Bollywood fashion designer **Manish Malhotra**. 

Despite these efforts, Air India's reputation has been damaged by recent incidents, including complaints about **bugs and vermin** on planes and the death of an 80-year-old passenger due to a shortage of wheelchairs. These issues, along with staff discontent, are impacting the airline's turnaround plans. The group is introducing a new pay structure and has lowered the average staff age to 35, but managing discontent among employees, especially with the introduction of merit-based contracts, remains a crucial challenge. 

With India's rapidly growing domestic aviation market and the government's ambition to position the country as a global hub, the successful overhaul of Air India is significant. However, it is expected to be a lengthy process, with analysts predicting it could take up to two years to resolve service issues and negotiate with staff.
