Booking.com首席执行官批评欧盟“愚蠢”的规定

**Booking Holdings 首席执行官批评欧盟法规** 

Booking Holdings 首席执行官 Glenn Fogel 批评欧洲联盟 (EU) 的法规“愚蠢”，并声称这些法规使该公司处于竞争劣势。该集团的新数字规则迫使 Booking 允许酒店公司在自己的网站上提供比其阿姆斯特丹子公司 **Booking.com** 更低的价格。

Fogel 对禁止向客户提供最佳价格的法规表示担忧，并指出他从未拒绝任何可能的事情，包括由于担心欧盟加强对科技公司的监管而将公司总部搬离欧盟。 Booking Holdings 在欧盟面临监管挫折，例如根据《数字市场法》（DMA）被指定为“在线门户守护者”，这增加了诸如在竞争对手之前推广自己的服务等额外负担。

该公司还对布鲁塞尔阻止 Booking 收购瑞典 Etraveli Group 的决定提出上诉，理由是担心会损害竞争。欧盟计划根据 DMA 使用新权力来应对主要的美国科技公司，并考虑对 Google 母公司 Alphabet 采取行动，因为其偏爱自己的应用商店，以及 Meta（Facebook）使用个人数据进行广告。

Fogel 敦促布鲁塞尔和成员国仔细考虑创造一个确保欧洲在技术领域保持领先地位的气候，而欧洲委员会强调，依赖门户守护者平台的企业用户现在根据 DMA 拥有前所未有的机会。

 **Booking Holdings' CEO Criticizes EU Regulations**  

The chief executive officer (CEO) of Booking Holdings, Glenn Fogel, has criticized European Union (EU) regulations as "dumb" and claimed they put the company at a competitive disadvantage. The new digital rules from the bloc have forced Booking to allow hotel companies to offer lower prices on their own websites than on **Booking.com**, its Amsterdam-based subsidiary.

Fogel expressed concerns about regulations that prohibit giving customers the best prices and stated that he never says no to anything possible, including moving the company's headquarters out of the EU due to his worries over increased scrutiny on tech groups by the bloc. Booking Holdings has faced regulatory setbacks in the EU, such as being designated an "online gatekeeper" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which imposes additional burdens like promoting its own services ahead of rivals.

The company is also appealing against a decision by Brussels to block Booking's acquisition of Sweden's Etraveli Group, citing concerns about competition damage. The EU plans to use new powers under the DMA to tackle major US tech companies and has considered taking action against Google parent Alphabet for favoring its own app store and Meta owner Facebook for using personal data in advertising.

Fogel urged Brussels and member states to think carefully about creating a climate that ensures Europe remains a leader in technology, while the European Commission emphasized that business users depending on gatekeepers' platforms now have unprecedented opportunities under the DMA.
