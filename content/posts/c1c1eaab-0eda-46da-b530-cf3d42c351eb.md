安永要求离职员工在英国裁员计划中保持沉默

# PwC英国静默裁员

在最近几周，PwC在英国多个办事处启动了一轮“静默裁员”。该公司指示受影响员工避免披露离职原因，并遵循推荐的辞别消息措辞。这一举动是新的自愿离职计划的一部分，尚未正式内部宣布。

**自愿离职计划细节：**
- 受影响的员工在没有公司正式公告的情况下单独被告知该提议。
- 接受该套餐的员工必须遵守人力资源部门提供的辞别消息脚本，避免提及自愿离职或离职原因。推荐措辞强调了对未来机会的兴奋和对PwC同事的感激之情。

**静默裁员背后的原因：**
PwC的决定是在去年公司裁员后，离职率显著下降的情况下做出的。自愿离职计划针对伦敦和贝尔法斯特办事处的咨询、风险和运营以及托管服务部门。然而，PwC尚未确认其他地点或业务线是否受到影响。

**PwC声明：**
该公司表示，这一举动是为了应对不断变化的客户需求、离职率和新机遇。通过实施有限的有针对性的自愿离职，他们可以继续在入门级和需要不同技能的领域招聘。该计划也恰逢马可·阿米特拉诺（Marco Amitrano）被任命为高级合伙人，接替凯文·埃利斯（Kevin Ellis）几周之后。

**行业背景：**
PwC并非唯一实施裁员的大四会计师事务所；德勤、安永和毕马威也由于经济形势恶化影响了某些服务的需求，在最近几个月减少了员工数量。

 **PwC's Silent Lay-offs in UK**  

In recent weeks, PwC has initiated a round of "silent lay-offs" across multiple offices within the United Kingdom. The firm instructed affected staff to refrain from disclosing their departure reasons and follow suggested wording for farewell messages if they choose to send them. This move is part of a new voluntary severance program, which has not been officially announced internally.

**Voluntary Severance Programme Details:**  
- Affected staff are individually informed about the offer without any official announcements being made within the company.
- Employees who accept the package must adhere to a script provided by HR for farewell messages, avoiding references to the voluntary severance or their reasons for leaving. The suggested wording emphasizes excitement for future opportunities and appreciation of colleagues at PwC.

**Reasons Behind Silent Lay-offs:**  
PwC's decision comes after a significant drop in attrition rates, with the firm cutting around curosrly last year. The voluntary severance program targets consulting, risk and operational, as well as managed service divisions within London and Belfast offices. However, PwC has not confirmed whether other locations or business lines are affected.

**PwC's Statement:**  
The firm stated that the move is necessary to respond to changing client demand, attrition rates, and new opportunities. By implementing limited targeted voluntary severance, they can continue recruiting at entry level and where different skills are needed. The scheme also comes just weeks before Marco Amitrano's appointment as senior partner, succeeding Kevin Ellis.

**Industry Context:**  
PwC is not the only Big Four accountancy firm to implement job cuts in recent months; Deloitte, EY, and KPMG have also reduced their workforce due to a worsening economic backdrop affecting demand for some of their services.
