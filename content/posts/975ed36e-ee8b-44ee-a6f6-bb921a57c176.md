Getir准备拆分并注入Mubadala资金

**Getir** 即将拆分为两家独立企业，并从阿布扎比主权财富基金穆巴达拉投资公司获得大量资金注入。这家快速杂货配送初创公司的股东已同意进行重组：

1. 土耳其食品配送业务由现有投资者 **穆巴达拉** 控制，并由长期经理 Batuhan Gultakan 领导。该公司创始人 Nazim Salur 将继续担任少数股东和董事会成员。
2. 一个单独的独立集团，包括电子商务、打车等其他资产，以及纽约的 FreshDirect 杂货配送服务。这个实体将由 Getir 的联合创始人控制，包括 Salur。

**穆巴达拉投资公司** 将领导 2.5 亿美元的资金注入，并收购 Getir 土耳其杂货业务的大多数控制权。在公司面临因利率上升、科技股价格下跌以及风险资本市场放缓导致的投资者对亏损初创企业兴趣下降等挑战后，该重组于周日获得批准。

Getir 于 2015 年创立，是快速杂货配送服务的的先驱，但由于市场状况，不得不缩减在土耳其以外的业务。该公司估值从 2022 年的近 120 亿美元下降到去年筹集 5 亿美元资金时不到该数额的四分之一。

快速杂货配送领域的大多数竞争对手要么被出售，要么在消费者需求发生变化后关闭，而欧洲和美国的在线食品配送集团在争夺市场份额的同时继续亏损。

 **Getir** is set for a break-up and will receive a significant cash injection from Abu Dhabi's wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company. Shareholders in the rapid grocery delivery start-up have agreed to restructure into two independent businesses:

1. A food delivery business in Turkey, controlled by existing investor **Mubadala** and led by longtime manager Batuhan Gultakan. The company's founder Nazim Salur will continue as a minority investor and board member.
2. A separate standalone group comprising other assets such as ecommerce, taxi hailing, and the FreshDirect grocery service in New York. This entity will be controlled by Getir's co-founders, including Salur.

**Mubadala Investment Company** is leading a $250 million funding injection and acquiring majority control of Getir's Turkish grocebo operations. The restructuring was approved on Sunday after the company faced challenges due to rising interest rates, falling technology stock prices, and reduced investor appetite for loss-making startups during a slowdown in venture capital markets.

Getir, founded in 2015, pioneered rapid grocery delivery services but had to scale back its operations outside Turkey due to market conditions. The company's valuation dropped from nearly $12 billion in 2022 to less than a quarter of that sum when it raised $500 million last year.

Most competitors in the rapid grocery delivery space have either been sold or shut down as consumer demand shifted after lockdowns eased, and online food delivery groups in Europe and the US continue to battle for market share while incurring significant losses.
