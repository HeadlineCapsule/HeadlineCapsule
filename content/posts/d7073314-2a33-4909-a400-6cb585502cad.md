# 美国绿色能源推动预计将带来 470 亿美元的**绿色税收抵免**市场

**《降低通胀法案》** 引发了**绿色税收抵免**新市场的诞生，Blackstone、Vitol 和电影制片厂等投资者寻求抵消税收负债。预计该市场规模将接近 500 亿美元，**Evercore** 预计在 2024 年完全运营的第一年将出售价值 470 亿美元的抵免额。该法案允许自由买卖这些抵免额，为可再生能源项目提供急需的资金。这对面临高利率和通货膨胀的开发商来说是一个令人欢迎的发展，包括施耐德电气和Drax在内的多家公司正在利用这些抵免额来减少他们的美国税单。这些税收抵免也吸引了石油和天然气行业的买家和卖家，他们希望管理自己庞大的税收负债。一些人认为这些抵免额是一个“游戏规则改变者”，预计该市场将继续增长，到 2030 年每年供应将超过 1000 亿美元。然而，过程的复杂性和项目可行性不确定导致一些潜在买家犹豫不决。

# US Green Energy Push Expected to Generate $47bn Market in Tax Credits

The **Inflation Reduction Act** has sparked the creation of a new market for **green tax credits**, with investors such as Blackstone, Vitol, and film studios seeking to offset tax liabilities. This market is expected to reach nearly $50 billion in size, with **Evercore** projecting $47 billion worth of credits to be sold in 2024, the first full year of operations. The act allows for the free buying and selling of these credits, providing much-needed funding for renewable energy projects. This has been a welcome development for developers facing high interest rates and inflation, and a range of companies, including Schneider Electric and Drax, are taking advantage of these credits to reduce their US tax bills. The tax credits have also attracted buyers and sellers from the oil and gas industry, looking to manage their large tax liabilities. The credits are seen as a "game-changer" by some, and the market is expected to continue growing, with an annual supply of over $100 billion by 2030. However, the complexity of the process and uncertainty over project viability have led to some hesitation among potential buyers.
