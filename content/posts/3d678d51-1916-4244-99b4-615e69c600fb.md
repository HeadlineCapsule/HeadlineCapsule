# **英国**雄心勃勃的**财政部**需要改革

**英国**实力雄厚、颇具影响力的**财政部**受到密切关注，人们呼吁进行改革以解决其在管理国家经济事务方面存在的不足。批评主要集中在财政部在平衡其相互矛盾的目标方面面临的困难，以及它倾向于微观管理和保密性方面。

虽然财政部在对政府支出实施纪律方面的作用至关重要，但它对收支平衡和物有所值的关注有时会掩盖其增长任务。这种“财政部思维”的观念导致了对雄心勃勃、前瞻性项目的犹豫不决。此外，财政部的公务员因微观管理资金分配和支出不足而受到批评，阻碍了其他公共机构财务管理能力的提高。

为解决这些问题，建议进行改革，以权力下放和改善部门间协调为目标。这包括将更多权力下放给其他政府和地方当局，提高他们应对区域经济需求和制定有效政策的能力。还建议将财政部的增长单位与预算职能部门同等重要，以确保增长考虑因素成为税收和支出决策的核心。

此外，资源充足的**预算责任办公室**可以更好地监督财政部对增长产生的长期影响。归根结底，虽然需要解决财政部短期行为的倾向，但改革成功与否将取决于下一任首相能否阐明和坚持一致的经济战略。

# Britain's Mighty Treasury Needs to Change

**Britain's** powerful and influential **Treasury** has come under scrutiny, with calls for reform to address its shortcomings in managing the country's economic affairs. The criticism centers on the Treasury's struggle to balance its contrasting objectives and its tendency towards micromanagement and secrecy. 

/n/n

While the Treasury's role in imposing discipline on government spending is essential, its focus on balancing the books and ensuring value for money has sometimes overshadowed its growth mandate. This "Treasury brain" mentality has led to a hesitancy towards ambitious, future-oriented projects. Additionally, the Treasury's civil servants have been criticized for micromanaging funding allocation and underspends, hindering the development of financial management capabilities in other public bodies. 

/n/n

To address these issues, reforms are suggested to decentralize power and improve coordination between departments. This includes devolving more powers to other government and local authorities, enhancing their ability to respond to regional economic needs and design effective policies. Putting the Treasury's growth unit on par with its budgetary functions is also proposed to ensure growth considerations are central to tax and spend decisions.

Furthermore, a well-resourced **Office for Budget Responsibility** could provide better scrutiny of the Treasury's long-term impact on growth. Ultimately, while the Treasury's tendencies towards short-termism need addressing, the success of any reforms will depend on the next prime minister's ability to articulate and commit to a coherent economic strategy.
