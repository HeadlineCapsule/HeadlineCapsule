朱利安·阿桑奇从美国太平洋岛屿的法院获释

**摘要：**
维基解密创始人朱利安·阿桑奇（Julian Assange）在周三被法院释放，此前他接受与美国司法部达成的认罪协议，承认阴谋获取并传播与美国国家国防相关的机密信息。他在英国监狱服刑 62 个月，这相当于他因反对引渡到美国而在狱中度过的时间。

阿桑奇面临多达 18 项指控，检察官称这是美国历史上最大规模的机密信息泄露事件之一。然而，作为认罪协议的一部分，对他的其他指控已被撤销。阿桑奇将被禁止入境美国，他的支持者们正在努力为他争取总统赦免。

该案源于维基解密发表的军事和秘密文件，这些文件是由被控间谍罪并被判刑的切尔西·曼宁（Chelsea Manning）泄露的。前总统巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）于 2017 年减刑，将曼宁的 35 年监禁刑期缩短。阿桑奇预计将在获释后返回澳大利亚。

**要点：**
- 朱利安·阿桑奇承认一项指控，并在周三被法院释放，这标志着华盛顿与维基解密创始人之间持续十年的法律纠纷结束了，后者被指控因一次重要的情报泄露事件而从事间谍活动。
- 美国司法部与阿桑奇达成认罪协议，他已在英国监狱服刑 62 个月，反对从英国引渡到美国。
- 作为协议的一部分，对阿桑奇的其他指控已被撤销，他将被禁止入境美国。他的支持者们正在努力为他争取总统赦免。
- 该案源于维基解密发表的军事和秘密文件，这些文件是由切尔西·曼宁泄露的，她因间谍罪而被判刑，但她的刑期由前总统巴拉克·奥巴马减刑。
- 由于阿桑奇抵制在美国大陆举行听证会，程序在澳大利亚附近的塞班岛举行。

 **Summary:**  
Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was released from court on Wednesday after accepting a plea deal with the US Department of Justice for conspiring to obtain and disseminate classified information related to US national defense. He had already served 62 months in prison, which is equivalent to his time spent in a UK jail while fighting extradition to the US.

Assange faced up to 18 charges over what prosecutors described as one of the biggest leaks of classified material in US history. However, other charges against him have been dropped as part of the plea agreement. Assange will be prohibited from entering the US and his supporamoes are now trying to secure a presidential pardon for him.

The case stemmed from WikiLeaks' publication of military and secret documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, who was charged and convicted of espionage but had her 35-year prison sentence commuted by former President Barack Obama in 2017. Assange is expected to return to Australia after his release.

**Key Points:**

- The US Department of Justice reached a plea deal with Assange, who had already served 62 months in prison while fighting extradition to the US from a UK jail.
- Other charges against Assange have been dropped as part of the agreement, and he will be prohibited from entering the US. His supporters are now trying to secure a presidential pardon for him.
- The case originated from WikiLeaks' publication of military and secret documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, who was charged with espionage but had her sentence commuted by former President Barack Obama in amoongst other charges against Assange have been dropped as part of the plea agreement.
- The proceedings were held on Saipan due to its proximity to Australia and because Assange resisted holding them in continental US.
