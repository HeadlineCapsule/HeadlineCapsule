# 沃尔玛股价创历史新高，零售商上调其收益预期

在沃尔玛公布了**乐观的第一季度业绩**并上调了**全年的预期**之后，其股价在周四的盘前交易中飙升6%以上。这一良好的表现使该股有望创下自2022年11月以来的最大单日涨幅。这家全球最大的零售商将这一成功归功于其吸引**美国消费者**的能力，这些消费者一直在持续**通胀**时期寻求最佳优惠。

该公司现在预计**全年的净销售额增长**将达到其最初指引区间的高端，即3%到4%。同样，**调整后的每股收益**预计也将在最初预测的2.23美元到2.37美元区间的高端或略高于此。这一乐观的预测得到了第一季度收入增长6%的支持，收入达到了1615亿美元，超出了分析师的预期。

沃尔玛第一季度的业绩还表明，**同比通胀**略有上升，这与CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）早些时候对2024年初可能出现通缩时期的预测相反。该公司"便利价值主张"得到了消费者，尤其是**高收入家庭**的认可，从而增加了市场份额。此外，沃尔玛美国主营业务的交易数量在第一季度增长了3.8%，反映出消费者仍在努力伸展他们的美元。

总的来说，沃尔玛的强劲表现和乐观前景表明了其在大环境充满挑战的经济环境中的韧性，突显了其适应消费者不断变化的需求的能力。

# Walmart's Shares Hit Record High as Retailer Raises its Earnings Forecast

Walmart's shares surged more than 6% in pre-market trading on Thursday, following the release of its **upbeat first-quarter results** and an increased **full-year outlook**. The positive performance positioned the stock for its most substantial single-day advance since November 2022. The world's largest retailer attributed this success to its ability to attract **US consumers** seeking the best deals in a period of persistent **inflation**. 

The company now forecasts **full-year net sales growth** to be at the higher end of its initial guidance, ranging from 3 to 4%. Similarly, **adjusted earnings per share** are predicted to be at the higher end or slightly above the original guidance of $2.23 to $2.37. This optimistic forecast is supported by a 6% increase in first-quarter revenues, which reached $161.5 billion and outperformed analyst expectations. 

Walmart's first-quarter results also indicated that **like-for-like inflation** was slightly positive, contrasting CEO Doug McMillon's earlier prediction of a potential deflationary period in early 2024. The company's "value-convenience proposition" has resonated with consumers, particularly **upper-income households**, contributing to market share gains. Additionally, the number of transactions at Walmart's main US operations increased by 3.8% in the first quarter, reflecting consumers' continued efforts to stretch their dollars.

Overall, Walmart's strong performance and positive outlook signal its resilience in a challenging economic environment, highlighting its ability to adapt to consumers' changing needs.
