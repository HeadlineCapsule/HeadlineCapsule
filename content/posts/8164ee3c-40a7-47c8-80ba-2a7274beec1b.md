美国大学4名教师在中国被捅伤

**四名美国学院教师在中国被刺伤** 

周一发生的一起孤立事件导致四名美国学院教师在北华大学和康奈尔学院组织的交流项目期间被刺伤。这起袭击发生在吉林东北部中国大学校园附近的公共公园。视频片段显示，三名受伤者躺在地上，身边流着鲜血，向周围的中国公民求助。

在美中关系去年达到最低点后，两国都在努力缓和紧张局势。在11月与美国总统乔·拜登举行峰会后，中国国家主席习近平表示有兴趣在五年内邀请5万名美国人到中国学习。目前，在中国学习的美国人不到1000人。

受害者包括三名美国公民和一名印度籍人士。美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文对这起事件表示深切关注，并祝愿受害者早日康复。他还提到，他们的团队已经与美国和中国双方联系，以确保采取适当的医疗和执法措施。

中国外交部表示，警方认为这次袭击是一起孤立事件，正在进行调查。发言人林建强调中国是世界上最安全的国家之一，并保证将继续保护所有外国人的安全。中国政府一直采取有效措施促进中美之间的文化交流。

吉林警方逮捕了一名55岁的男子，姓崔，他在公园里走路时撞到一名外国人，参与了这次袭击。爱荷华州州长金·雷诺兹对这一令人毛骨悚然的事件表示关切，并正在就此事与国务院联系。

一些中国社交媒体用户质疑，中国国家媒体煽动的排外和反美情绪是否导致了这次袭击，强调需要进一步研究这些情绪对公众行为的影响。

 **Four US College Teachers Stabbed in China**  

An isolated incident occurred on Monday when four teachers from a US college were stabbed during an exchange program organized by Beihua University and Cornell College. The attack took place at a public park near the university campus in Jilin, north-eastern China. Video footage showed three people lying injured on the ground with bleeding profuseby their sides as they called for help from a crowd of Chinese citizens.

The incident comes amidst efforts by both the US and China to ease tensions after relations reached rock bottom last year. Following his summit with President Joe Biden in November, President Xi Jinping expressed interest in inviting 50,000 Americans to study in China over five years. Currently, there are fewer than 1,000 US students studying in the country.

The victims included three American citizens and one Indian national. The United States' National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed deep concern for the incident and wished the victims a speedy recovery. He also mentioned that their team had been in touch with both Americans and Chinese counterparts to ensure proper medical treatment and law enforcement measures were taken.

China's foreign ministry stated that police believed this attack was an isolated incident, and an investigation is underway. Spokesperson Lin Jian emphasized China as one of the safest countries in the world and assured that the safety of all foreigners would continue to be protected. The Chinese side has always taken effective measures for cultural exchanges between China and the US.

Jilin police arrested a 55-year-old man, surnamed Cui, who was involved in the attack after bumping into a foreign national while walking in the park. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds expressed her concern over this horrifying incident as she is in touch with the state department regarding it.

Some Chinese social media users questioned whether anti-foreign and anti-US sentiment fueled by Chinese state media could have led to the attack, highlighting a need for further examination of these sentiments' impact on public behavior.
