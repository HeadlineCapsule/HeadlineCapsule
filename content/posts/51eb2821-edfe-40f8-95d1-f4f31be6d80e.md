尽管监管处于“空白”，但 Revolut 仍在加那利码头扩张

**Revolut 扩大总部到金丝雀码头，应对监管挑战**

总部位于英国的金融科技公司 Revolut 宣布计划将其总部扩展到位于金丝雀码头的 YY 大楼，尽管在获得全面银行牌照方面面临监管障碍。这一举措将增加 40% 的办公空间，总面积约为 **113,000 平方英尺**，占据新装修的 YY 大楼顶层四层。

Revolut 自 2015 年成立以来，总部一直设在金丝雀码头；然而，这一扩张标志着该公司迈出了重要的一步，因为它寻求巩固其在伦敦金融城的存在。YY 大楼以前是汤森路透社的所在地，以其显赫的位置和独特的股票市场行情显示而闻名。

做出扩张决定时，Revolut 正遇到获得银行牌照的持续挑战，这将使 Revolut 能够提供更多产品和服务，并增加在英国的贷款能力。由于审计人员无法完全核实 2021 年账户的收入数字等问题，该公司申请牌照已经拖延了三年多。

尽管面临这些挑战，Revolut 仍致力于其增长和扩张计划，重点是加强在英国市场的存在。该公司在广告上的投入也很大，2022 年仅营销和广告支出就达到 1.29 亿英镑，比前一年增加 5200 万英镑。

Revolut 搬到金丝雀码头被视为对该公司所在地和该地区本身投下了信任票，因为自大流行病改变了工作习惯以来，该地区经历了高调的离职和空置率。YY 大楼于 2019 年被 Quadrant 和 Oaktree Capital Management 收购，并于 2023 年完成装修。

随着 Revolut 全球员工人数不断增长——目前在全球拥有约 **10,000 名员工**，其中英国约有 **1,300 人**——这一扩大到金丝雀码头的举措是该公司的一个重要里程碑，表明了其致力于在伦敦金融城建立自己作为主要参与者的决心。

 **Revolut Expands Headquarters to Canary Wharf Amid Regulatory Challenges**

UK-based fintech company Revolut has announced plans to expand its headquarters into the YY building located at Canary Wharf, despite facing regulatory hurdles in obtaining a full banking license. The move will increase office space by 40%, totaling approximately **113,000 sq ft** and occupying the top four floors of the newly refurbished YY building.

Revolut's headquarters have been situated at Canary Wharf since its inception in 2amoyu 2015; however, this expansion marks a significant step forward for the company as it seeks to solidify its presence within London's financial district. The YY building was previously home to Thomson Reuters and is known for its prominent location and distinctive stock market ticker display.

The decision to expand comes amidst ongoing challenges in securing a banking license, which would allow Revolut to offer additional products and services as well as increase lending capabilities within the UK. The company's application has been stalled for over three years due to issues such as auditors being unable to fully verify revenue figures from 2021 accounts.

Despite these challenges, Revolut remains committed to its growth and expansion plans, with a focus on strengthening its presence in the UK market. The company has also been investing heavily in advertising, spending £129mn on marketing and advertising in 2022 alone – an increase from £52mn the previous year.

Revolut's move to Canary Wharf is seen as a vote of confidence not only for its home country but also for the area itself, which has experienced high-profile departures and vacancy rates since the pandemic altered working habits. The YY building was acquired by Quadrant and Oaktree Capital Management in 2019, with refurbishment completed in 2023.

As Revolut continues to grow its global headcount – currently standing at around **10,000 employees** worldwide, including approximately **1,300 in the UK** – this expansion into Canary Wharf represents a significant milestone for the company and demonstrates its commitment to establishing itself as a major player within London's financial district.
