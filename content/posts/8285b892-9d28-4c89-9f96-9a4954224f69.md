# 丰田混合动力汽车的热销使其在电池电动汽车方面仍需赶超

**丰田汽车公司**的利润实现了显著增长，在最新一季度增长近80%，这得益于**混合动力汽车**在全球汽车市场上意外复苏。然而，在快速转向**电动汽车**（EVs）的趋势下，该公司保守的战略（包括继续专注于混合动力汽车和**插电式混合动力汽车**（PHEVs））受到了批评。尽管该战略在今年取得了丰厚的回报，大幅提升了营业利润，但丰田对当前财年的预测却预计利润将大幅下滑，揭示了其在**电池电动汽车**（BEV）市场落后的真实程度。

丰田的成功得益于日元走弱以及美国等市场对混合动力汽车的强劲需求，混合动力汽车占其全球销量的多数，而BEV仅占约1%。然而，该公司不能忽视BEV的重要性，特别是在**中国**市场。中国是丰田的关键市场之一，预计BEV将占今年汽车销量的的一半。中国本土制造商在价格和智能汽车软件方面展开竞争，丰田的目标是提高其在这个关键市场的份额。为实现这一目标，该公司正投资于一项多元化战略，包括扩大其BEV和**氢燃料电池汽车**的产品线。

此外，丰田还在努力从近期丑闻中恢复，其附属公司和供应商被爆存在违规行为和操纵测试结果。尽管面临这些挑战，丰田的股价在过去一年中几乎翻了一番，交易价格是竞争对手大众汽车的两倍多。要想维持这种溢价，丰田必须开拓中国市场，重塑其声誉。

# Toyota's hybrid surge still leaves it playing catch-up on battery EVs

**Toyota Motor Corporation** has experienced a remarkable surge in profit, with a nearly 80% increase in the latest quarter, driven by the unexpected comeback of **hybrid vehicles** in the global car market. However, the company's conservative strategy, which includes a continued focus on hybrids and **plug-in hybrid vehicles** (PHEVs), has drawn criticism in the face of the rapid shift towards **electric vehicles** (EVs). While this strategy has paid off handsomely this year, with a significant boost in operating profit, Toyota's forecast for the current financial year anticipates a substantial drop, revealing the true extent of its lag in the **battery electric vehicle** (BEV) market. 

/n/n

The weak yen and strong demand for hybrids in markets like the US have contributed to Toyota's success, with hybrids making up the majority of its global sales, while BEVs account for only about 1%. However, the company cannot ignore the importance of BEVs, especially in **China**, one of its key markets, where they are expected to comprise half of all car sales this year. Local manufacturers in China are competing on both price and intelligent vehicle software, and Toyota aims to increase its market share in this critical market. To achieve this, the company is investing in a multipronged strategy that includes expanding its BEV and **hydrogen vehicle** offerings.

Toyota is also working to recover from recent scandals involving irregularities and manipulated test results by affiliates and suppliers. Despite these challenges, the company's stock has nearly doubled in the past year, trading at more than twice the valuation of rival Volkswagen. To maintain this premium, Toyota must address the Chinese market and restore its reputation.
