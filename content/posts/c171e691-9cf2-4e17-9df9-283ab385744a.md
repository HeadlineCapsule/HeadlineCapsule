# **瑞安航空**称夏季机票价格将低于预期 

欧洲最大的**低成本航空公司**——**瑞安航空**对高峰期的**机票价格**给出了谨慎的预测。尽管首席执行官**迈克尔·奥莱里**表示需求依然强劲，但近期的定价趋势却较为疲软，与之前的预期有所不同。这意味着票价将较去年持平或仅略有上升，而此前曾预计今年会提高10%。瑞安航空在发布这一更新的同时，也公布了截至3月的12个月财务业绩，显示利润大幅增长。该航空公司本财年的旅客人数预计将增加**8%**，但同时也担心潜在的干扰和交付延迟会影响其表现。

瑞安航空报告称税后利润跃升**34%**，达到19亿欧元，超越了疫情前的水平。尽管取得了不错的成绩，但由于可能影响运营的外部因素，该航空公司对未来的预测仍持谨慎态度。这些因素包括潜在的地缘政治冲突或干扰，以及波音飞机交付方面的持续挑战。瑞安航空原本预计到5月份会收到**211架** **波音737 Max** 喷气式客机，但现在预计至少会少交付23架飞机，而且还有可能出现进一步延迟。 

为了解决盈余现金储备的问题，该航空公司宣布了一项金额达7亿欧元的股票回购计划，并计划扩充董事会，前保守党内阁成员安伯·拉德将于今年7月加入董事会。瑞安航空谨慎乐观的信息与整个行业疫情后对空中旅行需求强劲反弹的大趋势形成对比，同时也凸显了依赖**波音公司**交付飞机的航空公司所面临的潜在阻力和复杂运营环境，包括供应链问题和地缘政治紧张局势等因素的影响。

# Ryanair says summer airfares will be lower than expected  

**Ryanair**, Europe's largest **low-cost carrier**, has issued a cautious forecast for peak summer **airfares**. While demand remains positive according to chief executive **Michael O'Leary**, recent pricing trends have been softer than anticipated. This marks a shift from previous expectations of a 10% increase in fares, now projected to be flat or only moderately higher compared to the previous year. The update comes alongside Ryanair's financial results for the 12 months ending March, which showed a significant profit surge. The airline is aiming for an **8%** increase in passenger numbers this financial year but remains wary of potential disruptions and delivery delays impacting its performance.

Ryanair has reported a **34%** jump in post-tax profits to €1.9bn, outperforming pre-pandemic levels. Despite the positive results, the airline is taking a cautious stance on future projections due to external factors that could impact operations. These include potential geopolitical conflicts or disruptions and ongoing challenges with aircraft deliveries from Boeing. Ryanair had anticipated receiving 211 **Boeing 737 Max** jets by May but currently expects a shortfall of at least 23 planes, with the possibility of further delays. 

To address surplus cash reserves, the airline has announced a €700mn share buyback program and plans to expand its board with former Conservative cabinet member Amber Rudd joining in July. Ryanair's message of cautious optimism stands in contrast to the broader industry trend of booming post-pandemic demand for air travel but underscores the potential headwinds faced by airlines reliant on **Boeing** deliveries as they navigate a complex operating environment marked by supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions
