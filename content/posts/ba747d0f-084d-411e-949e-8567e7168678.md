# 银行与非银行金融机构之间的界限日益模糊 

**非银行金融机构** (**NBFIs**) 历来被视为与传统银行分离的实体，由于其规模较小且业务运作不同，因此监管较为宽松。然而，随着 **NBFI** 业务和风险与银行日益 **交织**，这种区别正在变得模糊。Acharya、Cetorelli 和 Tuckman 的这篇论文探讨了银行与 **NBFIs** 之间不断演变的关系，对二者应分开运作和监管的传统观点提出了挑战。 

这些作者认为，**NBFIs** 不再只是受到轻微监管的“小老弟”，它们的活动和风险与银行深度 **相互依存**。他们举例说明了这种 **相互依存** 关系，例如银行向 **NBFIs** 出售贷款，以及 **NBFIs** 使用银行信贷额度进行仓储融资。这挑战了仅监管银行足以保护金融体系免受 **NBFIs** 失败影响的观点。 

论文的研究结果通过和弦图直观呈现，该图说明了银行与 **NBFIs** 之间复杂的联系。该图表揭示了它们之间关系的多样性和相互连接性，突显了将二者视为分离实体所可能产生的监管挑战和风险。

# The increasingly blurred lines between banks and NBFIs 

**Non-bank financial institutions** (**NBFIs**) have historically been considered separate from traditional banks, with looser regulations due to their smaller size and different operations. However, this distinction is blurring as **NBFI** businesses and risks become increasingly **interwoven** with those of banks. This paper by Acharya, Cetorelli, and Tuckman explores the evolving relationship between banks and **NBFIs**, challenging the traditional view of their separate operations and regulatory needs. 

/n/n

The authors argue that **NBFIs** are no longer just "under-regulated little big brothers" to banks but that their activities and risks are deeply interconnected. They provide examples of this **interdependence**, such as the sale of loans from banks to **NBFIs** and the use of bank credit lines by **NBFIs** for warehouse financing. This challenges the notion that regulating banks alone is sufficient to protect the financial system from the failures of **NBFIs**. 

The paper's findings are visualized through a chord diagram, illustrating the complex linkages between banks and **NBFIs**. This chart reveals the diverse and interconnected nature of their relationships, highlighting the potential regulatory challenges and risks that may arise from treating them as separate entities.
