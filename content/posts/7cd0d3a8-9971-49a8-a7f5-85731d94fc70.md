社会流动性必须重新进入政治词汇。

## 摘要：
这篇文章讨论了英国政治中**社会流动性下降**的问题，以及它如何影响来自平凡背景的人在各个领域取得成功的愿望，如首席执行官、外科医生、政治家、演员和企业家。作者强调了导致这种下降的几个因素：

1. **住房成本** 将社区按收入划分，限制了跨阶层友谊。
2. 从稳定的收入转向更加不稳定的中产阶级，增加了工作和住房的不安全感。
3. 生活费用上升，无偿工作的投资组合增加，使有才能的人更难展示他们的技能并确保获得有偿职位。
4. 伦敦以外的机会有限，因为高薪职业集中在首都。
5. 有必要改变政策以解决这些问题，并将**社会流动性**作为政治优先事项。


## 有趣的问题：
**Q1:** 收入从稳定转向不稳定的中产阶级是如何影响个人规划未来的能力？
**A1:** 这种变化使人们更难做出长期计划，因为他们面临着工作和住房的不安全感。收入稳定性的不确定性妨碍了他们储蓄或投资于可能导致向上社会流动的机会的能力。因此，由于担心经济不稳定，个人可能会不太愿意追求高等教育或冒险职业发展。

**Q2:** 住房成本和社区隔离是如何影响跨阶层友谊和愿望的？
**A2：** **住房成本**导致收入隔离加剧，富裕人士与低收入人群分开居住。这种分离限制了不同社会经济背景的人互动和建立关系的机会。跨阶层友谊可以在使看似遥不可及的志向正常化方面发挥关键作用；然而，当社区被收入所隔离时，这些联系的可能性就会减少。对多元化观点缺乏了解可能会阻碍出身平凡者的抱负，并限制他们对潜在职业道路或生活选择的认识。

**Q3:** 政策变化如何解决伦敦以外省份向上流动者获得高薪职位面临的挑战？
**A3：** 政策变化可以侧重于在各个地区创造更多技能岗位机会，而不是仅限于伦敦。这可能涉及到投资基础设施和资源以支持全国其他地区提供优厚报酬职位的行业。此外，旨在改善城市之间交通网络的政策可以使伦敦以外的人更容易获得首都内的工作机会。通过将高薪职业扩展到伦敦之外，具有向上流动潜力的人士将在所选择的领域取得成功的几率更大，并促进英国各地的社会流动性。

## Summary:
The article discusses the decline of social mobility in UK politics and its impact on individuals from humble backgrounds aspiring to achieve success in various fields such as CEOs, surgeons, politicians, actors, and entrepreneurs. The author highlights several factors that have contributed to this decline:

1. **Housing costs** segregating neighborhoods by income and limiting cross-class friendships.
2. A shift from stable incomes to a more precarious middle class with increased job and housing insecurities.
3. Rising living expenses for unpaid work portfolios, making it harder for talented individuals to demonstrate their skills and secure paid roles.
4. Limited opportunities outside of London due to the concentration of high-paying occupations in the capital city.
5. The need for policy changes that address these issues and reinvigorate social mobility as a political priority.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How has the shift from stable incomes to precarious middle class affected individuals' ability to plan for their future?
A1: This change has made it more difficult for people to make long-term plans, as they face increased job and housing insecurities. The uncertainty of income stability hinders their capacity to save money or invest in opportunities that could lead to upward social mobility. As a result, individuals may be less likely to pursue higher education or take risks on career advancement due to the fear of financial instability.

Q2: In what ways have housing costs and neighborhood segregation impacted cross-class friendships and aspirations?
A2: Housing costs have led to increased income segregation, with wealthier individuals living in separate areas from those with lower incomes. This separation limits the opportunities for people from different socioeconomic backgrounds to interact and form relationships. Cross-class friendships can play a crucial role in normalizing aspirations that might otherwise seem unattainable; however, when neighborhoods are segregated by income, these connections become less likely. This lack of exposure to diverse perspectives may hinder the ambitions of individuals from humble backgrounds and limit their understanding of potential career paths or life choices.

Q3: How can policy changes address the challenges faced by upwardly mobile provincials in accessing high-paying occupations outside of London?
A3: Policy changes could focus on creating more opportunities for skilled jobs across various regions, rather than concentrating them solely in London. This may involve investing in infrastructure and resources to support industries that offer well-paid positions in other parts of the country. Additionally, policies aimed at improving transportation networks between cities could make it easier for individuals from outside London to access job opportunities within the capital city. By expanding high-paying occupations beyond London, upwardly mobile provincials would have a better chance of achieving success in their chosen fields and contributing to social mobility across the UK.
