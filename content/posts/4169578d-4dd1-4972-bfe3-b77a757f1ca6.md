# TikTok 在法院挑战美国“极端”的《强制出售或禁令法案》

**TikTok** 及其中国母公司**字节跳动**已向美国政府提起诉讼，挑战一项近期通过的法律，该法律要求该公司要么**强制出售**给非中国企业，要么面临在美国市场被禁。该法律以**国家安全**担忧和对中国共产主义政党通过访问美国用户数据进行**间谍活动**的恐惧作为理由，于上月通过。

TikTok 在其请愿书中辩称，该法律**违反宪法**，侵犯了其受**《第一修正案》**保护的言论自由权。他们还声称，该行为构成“**非法占有私有财产**”，并且由于其业务的集成性质和规定的时限较短，出售或剥离股权并不可行。随着这起诉讼的发生，美国和中国之间的紧张关系升级，这起诉讼可能会变成一场旷日持久的法律战，并对 TikTok 在美国市场的未来产生潜在影响。

TikTok 为消除国家安全担忧所做的努力，例如其 **"Project Texas"** 倡议和与**美国外国投资委员会 (CFIUS)** 提议达成的安全协议，似乎都未得到回应，该公司声称其折衷尝试被忽视。继之前 TikTok 针对特朗普政府在 2020 年试图禁止该应用一事成功提起诉讼之后，又发起了此项法律挑战。此案的结果将对 TikTok 的未来和美国与中国的更广泛技术格局产生重大影响。

# TikTok challenges 'extreme' US divest-or-ban bill in court 

**TikTok** and its Chinese parent company, **ByteDance**, have filed a lawsuit against the US government, challenging a recent law that mandates the company to either **divest** from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the US market. The law, passed last month, cites **national security** concerns and fears of potential **espionage** by the Chinese Communist Party through access to data of US users. 

In their petition, TikTok argues that the law is **unconstitutional**, violating their **First Amendment rights** to free speech. They also claim that the act constitutes an **"unlawful taking of private property"** and that a sale or divestment is not a feasible option due to the integrated nature of their business and the short timeline stipulated. The lawsuit escalates the tensions between the US and China and is likely to be a protracted legal battle, with potential implications for the future of TikTok in the US market. 

TikTok's efforts to assuage national security concerns, such as their **"Project Texas"** initiative and a proposed security agreement with the **Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)**, have apparently fallen on deaf ears, with the company claiming that their attempts at compromise were ignored. This legal challenge follows a previous successful lawsuit by TikTok against the Trump administration's attempt to ban the app in 2020. The outcome of this case will have significant consequences for the future of TikTok and the broader US-China technological landscape.
