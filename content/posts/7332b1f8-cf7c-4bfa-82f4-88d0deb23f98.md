英伟达股价下跌，市值蒸发超过5500亿美元

# **英伟达市值暴跌** 

这篇文章讨论了领先的芯片制造商和科技公司英伟达（Nvidia）市场价值显著下降的情况。自上周短暂成为全球市值最高的公司以来，其股价已下跌16%，使其市值缩水超过5000亿美元。这次下跌使英伟达在上市公司中排名第三，仅次于微软和苹果。

**要点：**
- **英伟达市值下跌**：自上周以来，该公司市值损失超过5500亿美元，其股价周一下跌近7%。目前，其市值约为2.91万亿美元。
- **对标普500指数的影响**：英伟达的涨幅约占标普500指数2024年上涨的三分之一，因此人们担心其下跌可能导致更广泛的市场下挫。
- **CEO 出售股票**：在英伟达成为全球市值最高的公司之前不久，其 CEO Jensen Huang 出售了近9500万美元的股票。这些销售是3月份制定的一项预先安排的10b5-1销售计划的一部分。
- **与思科公司的比较**：迅速上涨随后下跌的情况与网络设备制造商思科（Cisco）类似，思科在2000年3月互联网泡沫高峰期短暂成为全球市值最高的公司后，其股价下跌了约80%。
- **对更广泛市场的影响**：英伟达的股价下跌影响了更广泛的芯片制造行业和纳斯达克综合指数，尽管其他行业上涨，但蓝筹股标普500指数收低。小盘股罗素2000指数上涨0.4%。

**分析师观点：**
一些分析师警告说，英伟达的大规模卖出可能引发更广泛的市场下跌，而另一些人则认为这对市场来说是一个“非常健康的发展”。科技部门及其对整体股票市场的影响的前景仍不确定。

 **Nvidia's Market Value Plummets**  

The article discusses Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and technology company, experiencing a significant drop in market value. Since briefly becoming the world's most valuable company last week, its shares have fallen 16%, erasing over $500 billion from its market capitalization. The decline has caused Nvidia to fall back to third place among publicly listed companies, behind Microsoft and Apple.

**Key Points:**  
- **Nvidia's Market Value Drop**: Since last week, the company lost more than $550 billion in market value as its shares fell almost 7% on Monday. The current market capitalization stands at approximately $2.91 trillion.
- **Impact on S&P 500 Index**: Nvidia's gains were responsible for roughly a third of the S&P 500's increase in 2024, and concerns have been raised that its decline could lead to broader market slumps.
- **CEO Share Sales**: The recent drop follows disclosures about Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang selling almost $95 million worth of shares shortly before the company became the world's most valuable firm. These sales were part of a previously scheduled Rule 10b5-1 sale plan set up in March.
- **Comparison to Cisco**: The rapid ascent and subsequent decline have drawn comparisons with networking equipment maker Cisco, which lost about 80% of its value after briefly becoming the world's most valuable company at the peak of the dotcom boom in March 2000.
- **Broader Market Impact**: Nvidia's decline has weighed on the broader chipmaking sector and affected the Nasdaq Composite, while the blue-chip S&P 500 closed lower despite gains in other sectors. The small-cap Russell 2000 index rose by 0.4%.

**Analysts' Perspectives:**  
Some analysts warn that a significant sell-off for Nvidia could spark broader market slumps, while others view the decline as a "super-healthy development" for the market. The future of the tech sector and its impact on the overall stock market remains uncertain.
