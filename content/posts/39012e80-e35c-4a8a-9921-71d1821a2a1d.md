# 加密货币资产管理公司灰度投资（Grayscale Investments）首席执行官离职 

**格雷斯克尔投资**公司的首席执行官[**迈克尔·松恩辛**](Michael Sonnenshein)已从他的职位上卸任，结束了他长达十年的任期。在这十年中，该公司确立了自身在加密货币资产管理领域的领先地位。他离职之际，正值 **比特币交易所交易基金 (ETF)** 新兴市场中的竞争日趋激烈。 

Sonnenshein 于 2014 年加入 Grayscale，在建立其**比特币投资信托**方面发挥了关键作用，并于 2021 年成为首席执行官。在他的领导下，Grayscale 今年早些时候实现了一个重要的里程碑：法庭胜利为 **美国证券交易委员会 (SEC)** 批准现货比特币 ETF 清除障碍。这一决定还允许 Grayscale 将自己的比特币信托转换为 ETF，使其在市场上抢先一步，资产管理规模达 280亿美元。 

然而，随着竞争对手（如**贝莱德公司(Fidelity)****、Ark Invest 和 BlackRock）推出收费较低的类似产品**，这家加密货币投资公司的领先地位已经动摇。因此，自今年1月以来，Grayscale ETF 的持有人已撤回了数十亿美元资金，使其资产管理规模降至约 194 亿美元。相比之下，贝莱德公司的比特币 ETF 的资产规模飙升至 184 亿美元。 

从 2023 年 8 月开始，Grayscale 将由前高盛员工 **彼得·明茨伯格(Peter Mintzberg)** 担任 Sonnenshein 的继任者。明茨伯格在一家世界领先的金融机构工作期间积累了丰富的战略和资产管理经验。新任首席执行官对 Grayscale 在加密货币领域的发展势头表示鼓舞，而 Sonnenshein 在领英上表达了他对与该公司共事经历的感激之情，并表示他将追求其他兴趣。 

Grayscale 还经营着规模庞大的**以太坊信托**，并正积极寻求美国证券交易委员会批准推出以太坊 ETF 产品。随着本周两项以太坊 ETF 申请决定期限迫近，该公司在这个细分市场的前景悬而未决。在明茨伯格于8月15日正式上任之前，格雷斯克尔公司将由首席财务官爱德华·麦吉（Edward McGee）领导过渡团队。

# Head of crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments steps down 

**Michael Sonnenshein**, chief executive of **Grayscale Investments**, has stepped down from his position, marking the end of a decade-long tenure that saw the firm establish itself as a leading cryptocurrency asset manager. His departure comes amidst increasing competition in the emerging market for **bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs)**. 

Sonnenshein joined Grayscale in 2014 and played a pivotal role in building up its bitcoin investment trust, becoming CEO in 2021. Under his leadership, Grayscale achieved a significant milestone with a court victory that paved the way for the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. This decision also allowed Grayscale to convert its own bitcoin trust into an ETF, giving it a head start in the market with $28 billion in assets under management. 

However, this lead has been eroded by rivals such as **Fidelity**, **Ark Invest**, and **BlackRock** offering similar products at lower fees. As a result, holders of the Grayscale ETF have withdrawn billions since January, causing its assets under management to drop to approximately $19.4 billion. In comparison, BlackRock's bitcoin ETF has surged to $18.4 billion in assets. 

Grayscale is now turning to **Peter Mintzberg**, formerly of Goldman Sachs, as Sonnenshein's successor starting in August 2023. Mintzberg brings expertise in strategy and asset management from his time at one of the world's leading financial institutions. The incoming CEO expressed enthusiasm for Grayscale's momentum in the crypto asset class, while Sonnenshein shared gratitude for his journey with the firm on LinkedIn as he moves on to pursue other interests. 

Grayscale also manages a substantial **ethereum trust** and is actively seeking approval from the SEC for an ethereum ETF product launch. With deadlines approaching this week for decisions on two ethereum ETF applications, Grayscale's future in this segment hangs in the balance. The company will be led by its CFO Edward McGee during the transition period until Mintzberg takes office on August 15th.
