玻利维亚将军因明显政变企图而被捕

# 玻利维亚将军在未遂政变后被逮捕

在戏剧性的转折中，被指控策划玻利维亚未遂政变的将军于周三晚上被该国武装部队逮捕。当军事车辆离开拉巴斯中央广场时，事件发生，全副武装的士兵强行进入国家宫殿。

**路易斯·阿尔塞总统谴责未遂政变**

玻利维亚总统路易斯·阿尔塞（Luis Arce）是前左翼领导人埃沃·莫拉莱斯（Evo Morales）的得力助手，在装甲军事车辆撞上总统宫入口后不久，他在电视直播中谴责了未遂政变。他呼吁玻利维亚人动员起来反对阴谋家，并用另一位陆军指挥官取代了胡安·何塞·苏尼加将军（Juan José Zúñiga），该指挥官敦促士兵们放下武器。

**苏尼加被捕，呼吁组建新内阁**

苏尼加将军穿着军服被拘留，而电视摄像机在场。他对当前局势表示失望，并呼吁成立新的部长会议。此外，他还要求释放多名被监禁的政治人士，包括前总统杰尼娜·阿涅兹（Jeanine Áñez）和路易斯·费尔南多·卡马乔（Luis Fernando Camacho）。

**莫拉莱斯呼吁支持者捍卫民主**

尽管他在2019年因争议性选举辞职后仍对玻利维亚具有重大影响力，埃沃·莫拉莱斯（Evo Morales）敦促他的支持者动员起来并捍卫民主。他说，他们不会允许武装部队侵犯民主原则或恐吓人民。

**国际社会谴责未遂政变**

这次未遂政变迅速受到国际社会的谴责，美国和欧盟都对任何试图破坏玻利维亚宪法秩序的行为表示关切。美洲国家组织呼吁军队服从玻利维亚合法选举产生的民事权力。

 **Bolivian General Arrested After Coup Attempt**

In a dramatic turn of events, the general accused of orchestrating an attempted coup in Bolivia was arrested by the country's armed forces on Wednesday night. The incident unfolded as military vehicles left the central plaza in La Paz and armed soldiers forcefully entered the national palace. 

**President Luis Arce Denounces Coup Attempt**

Bolivian President Luis Arce, a former protégé of ex-leftist leader Evo Morales, denounced the attempted coup on live television shortly after an armored military vehicle rammed into the entrance of the presidential palace. He called for Bolivians to mobilize against the plotters and replaced General Juan José Zúñiga with another army commander who urged soldiers to stand down.

**Zúñiga Arrested, Calls for New Cabinet**

General Zúñiga was detained in front of television cameras while wearing his military uniform. He expressed dismay over the current state of affairs and called for a new cabinet of ministers. Additionally, he demanded the release of several jailed politicians, including former president Jeanine Áñez and Luis Fernando Camacho.

**Morales Calls on Supporters to Defend Democracy**

Evo Morales, who still holds significant influence in Bolivia despite his resignation from the presidency following a disputed election in 2019, urged his supporters to mobilize and defend democracy. He stated that they would not allow the armed forces to violate democratic principles or intimidate people.

**International Condemnation of Coup Attempt**

The attempted coup drew swift international condemnation, with both the United States and European Union expressing concern over any attempts to disrupt Bolivia's constitutional order. The Organization of American States called on the army to submit itself to the legitimately elected civil power in Bolivia.
