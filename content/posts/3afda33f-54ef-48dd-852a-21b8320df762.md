法国左翼联盟在提前选举前开始出现裂痕

**法国新左翼集团在即将举行的补缺选举中面临裂痕**

法国最近成立的* 新人民阵线*（NPF）在其成立后不久就经历了内部动荡，这对埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的温和派联盟构成了威胁。 NPF的成立是为了在即将于6月30日举行的补缺选举中统一左翼力量，对抗极右翼和支持马克龙候选人，并可能在7月进行第二轮决选。

**极左翼领袖让-吕克·梅朗雄（Jean-Luc Mélenchon）清理党内温和派人士的做法引起了争议，导致其他左翼领导人如社会党领袖奥利维耶·法尔（Olivier Faure）的反弹。** 这种内部冲突可能会损害支持马克龙候选人的选举前景，使他们更难进入第二轮决选。

NPF是在四个左翼政党之间进行激烈谈判后成立的，这些政党在经济政策、欧盟政策和乌克兰问题上存在严重分歧，但他们团结起来反对玛丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）的国民联盟。然而，梅朗雄的清理行动给这个集团的团结带来了压力。

**极右翼政府可能成立，而左翼反对派成为最大的反对力量，这一前景震撼了金融市场，导致本周法国债务和股票出现抛售。** 作为回应，根据警方估计，大约75,000人在星期六下午巴黎的示威活动中抗议极右翼。

梅朗雄决定从法国不屈服党（France Insoumise）的选举候选人名单上删除几名同事，这一举动引起了批评，并受到左派女权主义原则的背叛指责。 这场争议导致LFI议员Quatennens（被妻子指控家庭暴力的备受争议的人物）在周日早上退出竞选。

**法国前总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德（François Hollande）确认他将在他的家乡科雷兹省（Corrèze） تحت اسم NPF 竞选议会席位。** 如果当选，奥朗德将成为法国第五共和国期间第二位担任国民议会议员的前国家元首。

马克龙的温和派联盟正在努力与拒绝支持国民联盟的中心右翼候选人达成地方互惠协议，以确保尽可能多的席位，而Les Républicains党在领导人埃里克·西奥蒂（Eric Ciotti）单方面同意与极右翼结盟后面临混乱。

总之，法国新人民阵线在其成立后不久就面临内部挑战，这可能会影响即将举行的补缺选举的结果，并对该国的左翼和温和派政党产生重大影响。

 **France's New Leftwing Bloc Faces Cracks Ahead of Snap Elections**

The recently formed *New Popular Front* (NPF) in France is experiencing internal turmoil just days after its creation, posing a threat to Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance. The NPF was established as a unified leftwing front against the far-right and pro-Macron candidates for the upcoming snap elections on June 30th with a potential second round runoff on July nk.

**Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon's purge of moderates within his party has sparked controversy, leading to backlash from other leftwing leaders such as Olivier Faure, the socialist chief.** This internal conflict could potentially harm pro-Macron candidates by making it more difficult for them to qualify for the second round runoff.

The NPF was formed after intense negotiations between four leftwing parties that are deeply divided on economic policies, EU policy, and Ukraine but have united against Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National. However, Mélenchon's purge has put the unity of the bloc under strain.

**The possibility of a far-right government with left opposition as its largest force has rattled financial markets, leading to sell-offs in French debt and equities this week.** In response, approximately 75,000 people demonstrated against the far-right in Paris on Saturday afternoon, according to police estimates.

Mélenchon's decision to remove several colleagues from France Insoumise (France Unbowed) election candidate lists has been met with criticism and accusations of betraying leftist feminist principles. The controversy led Quatennens, a protégé and controversial LFI MP accused by his wife of domestic violence, to withdraw his candidacy on Sunday morning.

**Former French president François Hollande has confirmed he will run for parliament under the NPF banner in his home region of Corrèze.** If elected, Hollande would become only the second former head of state to take a seat in the National Assembly during France's fifth republic.

Macron's centrist alliance is attempting to secure as many seats as possible by striking reciprocal local deals with center-right candidates that refuse to support RN, while Les Républicains party faces disarray after its leader Eric Ciotti unilaterally agreed on an alliance with the far-right.

In summary, France's New Popular Front is facing internal challenges just days after its formation, which could potentially impact the outcome of the upcoming snap elections and have significant implications for both leftwing and centrist parties in the country.
