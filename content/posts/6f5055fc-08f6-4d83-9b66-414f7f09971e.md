# 社交媒体投资骗局猖獗，顾问担忧

**英国金融监管机构正采取行动打击在社交媒体上由网红推广的欺诈性投资方案的激增现象**。**金融行为监管局（FCA）** 指控多位前真人秀明星通过 Instagram 推广一项风险较高的外汇计划，凸显了由**网红助长的投资骗局**问题。本周的指控是针对**网红金融推广**的广泛打击行动的一部分， FCA 在 2023 年删除了 10,000 条误导性广告，比前一年大幅增加。

巴克莱银行报告称，2022 年**投资骗局几乎增加了三分之一**，平均索赔金额超过 14,000 英镑，男性的平均损失为 16,000 英镑。**诈骗者经常使用先给出高额回报的战术来说服受害者投资的合法性**，导致损失更大、持续时间更长。**骗子还会利用值得信赖的公众人物的形象诱骗人们投资虚假基金**。在新冠肺炎疫情期间，在线投资（包括日内交易、加密货币和 "迷因股 "）的兴起也助长了骗局的激增。

**更令人担忧的是，许多年轻人更倾向于相信网络名人的金融信息，而不是独立财务顾问提供的信息**。顾问行业组织 Pimfa 警告说，这一趋势是财富管理和财务顾问行业专业人士的 "真正担忧"。 Stop Scams UK 敦促消费者保持警惕，在网上投资前寻求值得信赖的渠道提供的建议。

# Advisers worry as social media investment scams surge

**UK financial regulators are taking action against the surge in fraudulent investment schemes promoted by influencers on social media**. The **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** has charged several former reality TV stars for promoting a risky foreign exchange scheme via Instagram, highlighting the growing issue of **investment scams amplified by influencers**. This week's charges are part of a broader **crackdown on financial promotions by influencers**, with the FCA removing 10,000 misleading advertisements in 2023, a significant increase from the previous year. 

Barclays reports a **nearly one-third increase in investment scams** in 2022, with an average claim of over £14,000, and men losing an average of £16,000. **Fraudsters often use tactics like paying out initial high rewards to convince victims of the legitimacy of the investment**, leading to larger and more prolonged losses. **Scammers also use images of trusted public figures to lure people into fake funds**. The rise in online investment during the Covid-19 pandemic, including day trading, cryptocurrencies, and "meme stocks", has contributed to the surge in scams. 

**The issue is further exacerbated by the fact that many young people trust financial information from online personalities over independent financial advisers**. Pimfa, an adviser trade body, warns that this trend is a "genuine concern" for professionals in the wealth management and financial advice sectors. Stop Scams UK urges consumers to be cautious and seek advice from trusted sources before investing online.
