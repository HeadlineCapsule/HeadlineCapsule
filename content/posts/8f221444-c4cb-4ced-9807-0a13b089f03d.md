美联储批评了美国银行、花旗银行、高盛和摩根大通的“生前遗嘱”

**美联储批评美国大型银行的“遗嘱”**

联邦储备系统（美联储）和联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）发现了美国银行、花旗集团、高盛公司和摩根大通公司提交的“遗嘱”中的不足之处。这些遗嘱概述了每家银行如何处理自己的失败，以防止金融部门的系统性风险。

**发现的不足之处：**
- 这四家银行在用于对冲和交易风险的衍生品合同一方面存在问题。
- 在摩根大通和美国银行的某些衍生品交易解约系统中发现了小问题，因为它们没有经过充分测试。
- 高盛公司缺乏有关其衍生品交易的“交易级”信息；该银行被命令在9月初之前提交一份计划以解决此问题。
- 花旗集团收到了最严厉的批评：他们的解决方案计划被认为不可信，并且不会促进根据美国破产法进行有序的解决。 FDIC还引用了以前评估中未解决的“解决数据完整性”问题。

**监管响应：**
- 美联储认为花旗集团的数据管理弱点是一个不太严重的不足，但 FDIC 认为这削弱了其解决方案计划的可行性。
- 监管机构已要求这些银行在明年7月1日之前解决其遗嘱中发现的问题。

**银行回应：**
- 花旗集团表示，他们致力于解决监管机构提出的问题，并相信花旗集团可以在没有不利系统影响或纳税人资金的情况下得到解决。花旗集团首席执行官简·弗雷泽承认她在领导下的监管合规进展缓慢。
- 美国银行、高盛公司和摩根大通公司拒绝对此事发表评论。

**背景：**
“遗嘱”是在2008年金融危机之后引入的，以防止大型贷款机构失败导致的系统性风险。银行必须每两年提交一次计划供批准，监管机构发现不足的情况并不会受到处罚并不常见。

 **Federal Reserve Criticizes 'Living Wills' of Major US Banks**

The Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have identified shortcomings in the "living wills" submitted by Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. These living wills outline how each bank would handle its own failure to prevent systemic risk within the financial sector.

**Shortcomings Found:**
- All four banks have issues related to their derivatives contract portfolios used for hedging and trading risks.
- Minor problems were found in JPMorgan's and Bank of America's systems for unwinding certain derivatives trades, as they had not been fully tested.
- Goldman Sachs lacked "trade-level" information on its derivatives transactions; the bank was ordered to submit a plan by early September to resolve this issue.
- Citigroup received the most severe rebuke: their resolution plan was deemed not credible and would not facilitate an orderly resolution under US bankruptcy code. The FDIC also cited unresolved "resolution data integrity" issues from previous assessments.

**Regulatory Responses:**
- While the Fed found Citigroup's data management weakness to be a less severe shortcoming, the FDIC viewed it as a deficiency that undermined the feasibility of its resolution plan.
- The regulators have given these banks until July 1 next year to address the identified shortcomings in their living wills.

**Bank Responses:**
- Citigroup stated they are fully committed to addressing the concerns raised by the regulators and expressed confidence that Citi could be resolved without adverse systemic impact or taxpayer funds. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, acknowledged slow progress in regulatory compliance under her leadership.
- Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the matter.

**Background:**
Living wills were introduced following the 200cu>The financial crisis as a preventive measure against systemic risk from major lender failures. Banks must submit their plans for approval every other year, and it is not uncommon for regulators to flag shortcomings with little penalty.
