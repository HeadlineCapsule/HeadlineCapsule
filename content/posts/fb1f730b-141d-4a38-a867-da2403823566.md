# 伊万·波斯基，1937-2024年，遭定罪的交易员

**伊万·波斯基**（Ivan Boesky），一名与**80年代内幕交易丑闻**息息相关的[**华尔街套利商**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Boesky)**去世了，享年 87岁。波斯基以**并购专家**而闻名，他预测企业合并的能力让他声名鹊起，但他参与非法活动才真正定义了他的遗产。他的故事是华尔街过度投机的警示 tale，也导致了监管上的重大改变。

波斯基出生于底特律一个经营餐馆的中产阶级犹太家庭，他于20世纪60年代中期凭借岳家的资金踏入**华尔街**。他创办了自己的公司，专门从事被称为“**并购套利**”的策略，从企业合并期间股价的小幅差异中获利。他的最大胜利是雪佛龙以130亿美元收购海湾石油公司，这次交易为他带来了惊人的6500万美元的意外之财。

波斯基的能力迅速吸引了许多寻求投资机会的富人和机构。他被认为具有“超人”能力的名声与日俱增，对市场的影响力也越来越大——仅仅是传出"**波斯基在买入**"的耳语便能撼动股市。然而，他的成功建立在非法内幕交易活动之上； 波斯基用装满现金的皮箱贿赂银行家，以获取有关即将到来的交易的机密信息。

**1986年**，他因共谋罪认罪，不仅结束了自己的职业生涯，也连累了行业中的其他人士，如迈克尔·米尔肯（Michael Milken）和德崇证券公司（Drexel Burnham Lambert）。这起丑闻促使国会和美国证券交易委员会(SEC)颁布新的规则，首次明确定义内幕交易，为更严格的执法和未来对华尔街不当行为的调查铺平了道路。

尽管波斯基在积极从事非法活动的同时还在大学讲授有关并购的课程，但他遗留下的是贪婪和欺骗的名声。他的人生提醒人们过度追求财富的危险以及监管干预在遏制市场滥用行为方面的关键作用。

# Ivan Boesky, convicted trader, 1937-2024 

**Ivan Boesky**, a **Wall Street arbitrageur** who became synonymous with **insider trading scandals of the 1980s**, has passed away at age 87. Boesky's fame as a **mergers expert** and his ability to predict corporate combinations brought him into the limelight, but it was his involvement in illegal activities that defined his legacy. His story serves as a cautionary tale of Wall Street excess and led to significant regulatory changes. 

Born into a middle-class Jewish family running restaurants in Detroit, Boesky ventured onto **Wall Street** in the mid-1960s with capital from his wife's family. He founded his own firm specializing in an obscure strategy called **merger arbitrage**, exploiting small differences in stock prices during mergers for profit. His biggest triumph was Chevron’s $13bn takeover of Gulf Oil, generating a staggering $65 million windfall. 

Boesky's prowess quickly attracted wealthy individuals and institutions seeking investment opportunities. His reputation as someone with "superhuman" abilities grew, along with his influence on the market – a mere whisper that “**Boesky is buying**” could move markets. However, this success was built on illegal insider trading activities; Boesky bribed bankers with suitcases of cash for confidential information about upcoming deals. 

In 1986, he pleaded guilty to **conspiracy**, which not only ended his career but also brought down others in the industry such as Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank. This scandal prompted Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enact new rules defining insider trading for the first time, paving the way for stricter enforcement and future investigations into Wall Street misconduct. 

Despite teaching college courses on mergers while actively engaged in illegal activities, Boesky's legacy remains one of greed and deception. His life serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and the crucial role of regulatory intervention to curb market abuses.
