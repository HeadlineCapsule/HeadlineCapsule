# **雷·达里奥** 警告美国债务对国债市场的危险

**雷·达里奥**，**桥水公司**的亿万富翁创始人，表达了对美国不断上升的债务对国债债券影响的担忧，建议投资者将其投资组合多元化到国际市场。达里奥警告说，高债务水平和利率可能会吓跑外国投资者，尤其是美国对俄罗斯等国实施制裁的情况下。他的担忧与**国会预算办公室**和**美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔**的担忧一致，他们预见美国目前的财政路径将带来长期的经济挑战。今年，借贷成本已经攀升，影响了10年期国债收益率。达里奥建议投资于财务状况良好、内部稳定、在地缘政治冲突中保持中立的国家，比如印度、新加坡和一些海湾国家。他还强调了地域多元化投资的重要性，并认为黄金是良好的投资选择。达里奥的研究发现，美国发生“内战”的可能性越来越大，这不一定是指暴力冲突，而是政治极化的加剧。他认为2024年的总统选举将是应对这些风险的关键节点，包括气候变化和人工智能的影响。虽然没有明确支持任何候选人，但达里奥提到了他很欣赏泰勒·斯威夫特团结不同人群的能力。

# Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio warns of danger of US debt on Treasury market

**Ray Dalio**, billionaire founder of **Bridgewater Associates**, has expressed concerns about the impact of rising US debt on Treasury bonds, suggesting investors diversify their portfolios internationally. Dalio warns that high debt levels and interest rates could deter foreign investors, especially with the US imposing sanctions on countries like Russia. His worries align with those of the **Congressional Budget Office** and **Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell**, who foresee long-term economic challenges due to the country's fiscal path. Borrowing costs have already climbed this year, impacting 10-year Treasury yields. Dalio recommends investing in countries with strong balance sheets, internal order, and neutrality in geopolitical conflicts, naming India, Singapore, and some Gulf states as examples. He also highlights the importance of geographic diversification and considers gold a good investment option. Dalio's research identifies a growing likelihood of a US "civil war," not necessarily a violent one, but an escalation of political polarization. He believes the 2024 presidential election will be pivotal in addressing these risks, including climate change and the impact of artificial intelligence. While declining to endorse a candidate, Dalio mentions his appreciation for Taylor Swift's ability to unite diverse people.
