黑石公司转向“最佳和最终”报价收购Hipgnosis歌曲基金

**黑石公司对Hipgnosis歌曲基金的“最佳最终报价”**

美国私募股权集团黑石公司已提出其“最佳最终”要约，以收购英国上市公司音乐版权所有者Hipgnosis Songs Fund。这一举动旨在防止在下个月关键股东投票前，在该公司持有大量股份的对冲基金推动更高的价格。

一群美国和英国的对冲基金已经收购了Hipgnosis超过25%的股份，这可能足以在即将举行的会议上阻止黑石公司的报价。为了确保其收购获得批准，黑石公司需要在7月的股东投票中获得75%的多数票。

持有大量股份的对冲基金包括TIG（14%）、Glazer Capital（8%）、Kryger Capital（6.6%）和Sand Grove Capital Management（超过6%）。其中一些对冲基金已表示有兴趣获得更高的价格，称为“绿邮”。

然而，黑石公司最佳最终报价向对冲基金发出信号，任何阻止收购的企图都可能导致交易失败。美国私募股权集团已将其竞购结构调整为安排方案，将接受水平从50%提高到75%。这一变化防止了Hipgnosis少数股东在收购后继续成为股东，简化了完成交易的过程。

作为这次重组的一部分，黑石公司的报价价格小幅上涨，每股从1.30美元上涨至1.31美元。

 **Blackstone's 'Best and Final Offer' for Hipgnosis Songs Fund**

US private equity group, Blackstone, has made its "best and final" offer to acquire UK-listed music rights owner, Hipgnosis Songs Fund. This move aims to prevent hedge funds with significant stakes in the company from pushing for a higher price ahead of an essential shareholder vote on the $1.6 billion deal next month.

A group of US and UK hedge funds has acquired over 25% of Hipgnosis' shares, potentially enough to block Blackstone's offer at the upcoming meeting. To secure approval for its acquisition, Blackstone requires a 75% majority vote from voting shareholders in July.

Hedge funds that own significant stakes include TIG (14%), Glazer Capital (8%), Kryger Capital (6.6%), and Sand Grove Capital Management (over 6%). Some of these hedge funds have expressed interest in a higher price, known as "greenmailing."

However, Blackstone's best-and-final offer signals to the hedge funds that any attempt to block the takeover could result in the deal's collapse. The US private equity group has restructured its bid into a scheme of arrangement, raising the acceptance level from 50% to 75%. This change prevents minority Hipgnosis investors from remaining shareholders after the acquisition and simplifies completing the transaction.

Blackstone's offer price was modestly increased as part of this restructuring, moving from $1.30 per share to $1.31 per share.
