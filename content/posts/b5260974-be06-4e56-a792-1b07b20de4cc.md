# “逆向洋基”交易蓬勃发展，欧洲低借贷成本吸引美国企业

**美国公司** 越来越多地转向欧洲债券市场，**“逆向洋基”** 交易大幅增加。这一趋势受到多种因素的推动，包括**跨境并购** 的激增和对利率走势的重新评估，因为发行人希望利用欧洲相比美国更低的**借贷成本**。这些交易的总价值预计将在 2024 年达到约 850 亿欧元，接近 2019 年的创纪录水平。影响这一转变的一个因素是**欧洲和美国公司借贷成本** 之间的差距不断扩大，以欧元计价的公司债券收益率显著较低，为多元化和成本节约提供了吸引人的机会。欧元发行量最近激增的另一个原因是欧元区通胀回落到目标范围内的前景乐观，促使人们预期**欧洲中央银行** 将在**联邦储备委员会** 之前降息。

拥有多种货币收入流的大型美国公司对这种策略尤其感兴趣，逆向洋基债券的发行增加，与外国借款人在美国市场发行的“洋基”债券形成对比。**美国银行的巴纳比·马丁** 指出，欧盟和美国之间货币政策的分歧是主要动机。值得注意的例子包括**强生公司** 25 亿欧元的交易，为收购 Shockwave 提供资金，以及**默克公司** 34 亿欧元的债券发行，为在美国的收购和管理即将到期的债务融资。这种趋势也出现在信用评级低于投资级的公司中，表明其吸引力不仅限于投资级发行人。

# 'Reverse Yankee' deals boom as Europe's low borrowing costs lure US groups 

**US companies** are increasingly turning to Europe's bond markets, with a significant rise in **'reverse Yankee'** deals. This trend is driven by a combination of factors, including a surge in **cross-border mergers and acquisitions** and a reevaluation of interest rate trajectories, as issuers seek to take advantage of **lower borrowing costs** in Europe compared to the US. The total value of these deals is expected to reach approximately €85bn in 2024, just shy of the 2019 record. This shift is influenced by the widening gap between **European and US corporate borrowing costs**, with yields on euro-denominated corporate debt being significantly lower, creating an attractive opportunity for diversification and cost savings. The recent surge in euro issuance is also driven by the optimism surrounding Eurozone inflation returning to target, prompting expectations of the **European Central Bank** lowering interest rates before the **Federal Reserve**. 

Large US companies with diverse revenue streams in multiple currencies are especially drawn to this strategy, and the increased issuance of reverse Yankee bonds is named in contrast to "Yankee" bonds, which are issued by foreign borrowers in US markets. The divergence in monetary policies between the EU and the US is a key motivator, as noted by **Barnaby Martin of BofA**. Notable examples include **Johnson & Johnson's** €2.5bn deal to fund their acquisition of Shockwave and **Merck's** €3.4bn bond issuance to finance a US acquisition and manage upcoming debt maturities. The trend is also observed among companies with sub-investment grade credit ratings, indicating a broader appeal beyond just investment-grade issuers.
