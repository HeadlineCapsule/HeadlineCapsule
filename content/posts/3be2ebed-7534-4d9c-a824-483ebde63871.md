特朗普的审判以对明星证人迈克尔·科恩相互矛盾的描述而告终

# 摘要：
这篇文章讨论了前总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）审判的结案陈词和关键点，重点关注他在2016年总统大选前涉嫌参与一项计划以沉默色情女星斯托米·丹尼尔（Stormy Daniels）的指控。起诉方严重依赖迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）的证词，他用自己13万美元的钱支付了丹尼尔，后来又因联邦罪名认罪。特朗普被指控虚假记录这些付款为法律费用，以规避选举法。

辩护方认为科恩是一个不可靠的证人，因为他过去说过谎话，而且有个人利益动机，而起诉方则强调了支持科恩叙述的证据。陪审团将于周三开始审议，最有可能在当天宣布裁决。如果被判有罪，特朗普可能面临经济处罚，并将成为第一位被定罪的美国总统。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）过去的行动如何影响他在这次审判中的可信度？
   - 辩护方认为科恩曾经对联邦法官、国会、家人以及银行说过谎，使他成为“合理怀疑的人类体现”。这一历史被用来质疑他反对特朗普证词的可靠性。然而，检察官强调了支持科恩叙述的证据，包括支票、发票、短信、通话记录以及特朗普书籍的摘录。

2. 双方在结案陈词中提出了哪些关键证据？
   - 辩护方专注于因科恩过去的谎言和个人利益动机而贬低他，而起诉方则强调了支持科恩叙述的特朗普参与沉默斯托米·丹尼尔计划的文件。这些包括支票、发票、短信、通话记录以及特朗普书籍的摘录。

3. 这次审判可能会对唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的政治未来产生什么影响？
   - 如果被判有罪，特朗普可能面临经济处罚，并将成为第一位被定罪的美国总统。虽然他不太可能入狱，但这可能会影响他在即将举行的选举中的地位或任何未来的竞选公职。到目前为止，该审判对特朗普在民意调查中的支持率几乎没有影响，但额外的报道表明，乔·拜登（Joe Biden）的竞选团队在结案陈词期间派代表前往法院外。

**Summary:**
The article discusses the closing arguments and key points in the trial of former President Donald Trump, focncing on his alleged involvement in a scheme to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. The prosecution relied heavily on testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels with $130,000 of his own money and later pleaded guilty to federal charges. Trump is charged with falsely recording these payments as legal expenses in order to circumvent election laws.

The defense argued that Cohen was an unreliable witness due to past lies and motivations for personal gain, while the prosecution emphasized evidence supporting Cohen's narrative. The jury is set to begin deliberating on Wednesday, with a verdict potentially coming as soon as then. If found guilty, Trump could face financial penalties and would be the first US president convicted of a crime.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: How did Michael Cohen's past actions impact his credibility in this trial? 
   A: The defense argued that Cohen had previously lied to federal judges, Congress, family members, and banks, making him the "human embodiment of reasonable doubt." This history was used to question the reliability of his testimony against Trump. However, prosecutors emphasized evidence supporting Cohen's narrative, including documents such as cheques, invoices, text messages, call logs, and extracts from Trump's books.
   
2. Q: What were the key pieces of evidence presented by both sides during closing arguments? 
   A: The defense focused on discrediting Cohen due to his past lies and motivations for personal gain, while the prosecution emphasized documents supporting Cohen's narrative that Trump was involved in a scheme to silence Stormy Daniels. These included cheques, invoices, text messages, call logs, and extracts from Trump's books.
   
3. Q: How might this trial impact Donald Trump's political future? 
   A: If found guilty, Trump could face financial penalties and would be the first US president convicted of a crime. While he is unlikely to be jailed, it may affect his standing in the upcoming election or any potential run for office in the future. The trial has done little to dent his support in the polls so far, but additional reporting suggests that President Joe Biden's campaign team sent surrogates outside the courthouse during closing arguments.
