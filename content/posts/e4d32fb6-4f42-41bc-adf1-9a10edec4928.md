对冲基金空头在英国收购热潮中遭到重创

# 英国收购潮给对冲基金空头投资者带来损失

这篇文章讨论了如何对冲基金空头投资者因英国收购浪潮而遭受巨大损失。当Hargreaves Languish、Darktrace和Keywords Studios等股票在收购要约后出现大幅度价格上涨时，千禧管理、GLG和格拉德斯顿资本管理等知名基金措手不及。

对冲基金经理们对英国中型股公司低估值表示担忧，这使得它们成为外国竞争对手或私募股权买家的吸引目标。文章强调，由于这些风险以及股票被收购时可能发生的损失，短线操作英国中型股被认为是“疯狂”的。

根据伦敦证券交易所集团的数据，今年涉及英国目标公司的并购活动（M&A）同比2023年同期增长了84%。这种增长归因于英国股票与美国等市场股票之间的估值差距。

一些对冲基金经理通过在各种英国股票中分散短头投资或减少新投资规模来调整策略，以减少来自收购要约的潜在损失。文章得出结论称，估值仍然具有吸引力，私募股权公司持有大量未分配资金寻找交易机会，这对空头投资者来说存在风险。

 # Summary of Article: Hedge Fund Short Sellers Burnt by Flurry of UK Takeover Bids

The article discusses how hedge fund short sellers have faced significant losses due to a wave of takeover bids in the United Kingdom. Prominent funds such as Millennium Management, GLG and Gladstone Capital Management were caught off guard when stocks like Hargreaves Languish, Darktrace, and Keywords Studios experienced sharp price increases following acquisition offers.

Hedge fund managers have expressed concerns about the low valuations of UK mid-cap companies, which make them attractive targets for foreign rivals or private equity buyers. The article highlights that shorting a UK mid-cap stock is considered "insane" due to these risks and potential losses if the stock gets bid for.

The surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity involving UK targets has been 84% higher this year compared to the same period in 2023, according to data from London Stock Exchange Group. This increase is attributed to a valuation gap between UK stocks and other markets like the US.

Some hedge fund managers have adjusted their strategies by spreading short positions across various UK stocks or reducing the size of new bets in order to mitebate potential losses from takeover bids. The article concludes that valuations remain attractive, and there is a significant amount of unallocated capital held by private equity firms looking for deals, which poses risks on the short side of the book.
