# 保守党右翼必须为选举失败负责

本文对**保守党**右翼自我开脱和转移该党选举挫折的指责提出了质疑。作者认为，右翼应为其颓势负责，并指出**派对门**、**伊丽莎白·特拉斯的袖珍预算案**和**英国脱欧**是关键因素。文章驳斥了将目前的困境全部归咎于**里希·苏纳克**的说法，他既是前**英国脱欧支持者**，也是**鲍里斯·约翰逊**的“助推者”。相反，它断言右翼民粹主义议程损害了党的声誉，导致其不受欢迎。文章最后强调，准确地归咎于责任对于塑造保守党反对党的未来并确保有可选的工党替代方案至关重要。

文章对保守党右翼明显回避对该党选举斗争的责任表示震惊。它强调，右翼的偶像**鲍里斯·约翰逊**和**伊丽莎白·特拉斯**在民意调查意向大幅下降期间掌权。作者还认为，“终极项目”**英国脱欧**的支持率下降是保守党颓势的一个因素。

作者认为，**苏纳克**与右翼议程的联系，特别是他对**英国脱欧**的支持和对约翰逊的纵容，是他对该党困境的实际贡献。他们断言，右翼转移指责的企图忽视了事实，可能会损害该党的未来选举能力。文章最后强调，需要准确地归咎于责任，并摆脱右翼议程，以确保保守党的反对力量保持活力。

# The right must own the Tory defeat 

**The Conservative** right-wing's self-exoneration and deflection of blame for the party's electoral woes is challenged in this article. The writer argues that the right-wing is responsible for the party's slump, citing **Partygate**, **Liz Truss' mini-budget**, and **Brexit** as key factors. The article refutes the notion that **Rishi Sunak**, a former **Brexiteer** and **enabler of Boris Johnson**, is solely responsible for the party's current predicament. Instead, it asserts that the right-wing's populist agenda has soiled the party's reputation and contributed to its unpopularity. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of assigning blame accurately to shape the future of the Conservative opposition and ensure an electable alternative to Labour.

The article begins by expressing disbelief at the Conservative right's apparent detachment from responsibility for the party's electoral struggles. It highlights that the right-wing's idols, **Boris Johnson** and **Liz Truss**, were at the helm during significant drops in polling intentions. The writer also attributes the decline in support for **Brexit**, the right's "ultimate project," as a contributing factor to the Conservative slump. 

/n/n

The writer argues that **Sunak's** association with the right-wing agenda, particularly his support for **Brexit** and **enabling of Johnson**, is his actual contribution to the party's woes. They assert that the right-wing's attempts to deflect blame ignore the facts and could hinder the party's future electability. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for an accurate assignment of blame and a break from the right-wing agenda to ensure a viable Conservative opposition.
