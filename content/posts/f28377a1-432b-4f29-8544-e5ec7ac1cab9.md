亚马逊违反了英国对俄罗斯的制裁，前雇员在法庭上声称

# 摘要：
前 AWS 员工查尔斯·福雷斯特（Charles Forrest）指控其前雇主亚马逊网络服务（Amazon Web Services，AWS）在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后向莫斯科提供面部识别技术，违反了英国制裁。该指控于本周在伦敦中心就业法庭的初步听证会上提出。

# 要点：
- 前 AWS 员工查尔斯·福雷斯特（Charles Forrest）指控亚马逊在乌克兰被入侵后向莫斯科提供面部识别技术，违反了英国制裁。
- 该索赔是他在对 AWS 的不当解雇案中提出的证据的一部分。
- **面部识别技术**：福雷斯特声称亚马逊与俄罗斯公司 VisionLabs 达成交易，通过荷兰的一家空壳公司为其提供技术访问权限。英国在乌克兰被入侵后对莫斯科实施了制裁。
- **亚马逊的回应**：AWS 否认这些指控，并指出他们期待在法律程序中证明其论点。他们还反驳了福雷斯特因严重不当行为而被解雇的说法，称终止他的原因是未能遵守合同工时、出席会议或回复邮件。
- **其他指控**：福雷斯特声称，他在 2023 年 5 月向英国众议院国防特别委员会和严重欺诈办公室报告了 AWS 面部识别技术的非法活动。他还声称亚马逊违反了其自我强加的禁令，即禁止警方使用其面部识别技术，尽管在乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）谋杀案后实施了禁令。
- **亚马逊的反论**：该公司否认福雷斯特作出了任何受保护的披露，并质疑所披露的信息的识别以及与国际制裁相关的法律义务。他们还争辩说，他们不知道向严重欺诈办公室报告的内容，也不知道违反了自我强加的面部识别技术警察使用禁令。

该案件在就业法庭继续审理中。

 **Article Summary:** 
Former AWS employee Charles Forrest has accused his former employer, Amazon Web Services (AWS), of breaching UK sanctions by allegedly providing Moscow with facial recognition technology after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2nv23. The claim was presented during a preliminary hearing at the central London employment tribunal this week.

**Key Points:**
- **Charles Forrest,** an ex-AWS worker, alleges that Amazon breached UK sanctions by supplying Moscow with facial recognition technology post-invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
- The claim is part of evidence presented at a preliminary hearing for his unfair dismissal case against AWS.
- **Facial Recognition Technology:** Forrest alleges that Amazon closed a deal with Russian company VisionLabs, providing access to its technology through a shell company based in the Netherlands. The UK imposed sanctions on Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine.
- **Amazon's Response:** AWS denies these claims and states they look forward to demonstrating their merit during legal proceedings. They also refute that Forrest was dismissed for gross misconduct, citing his failure to work contractual hours and attend meetings or respond to emails as the reason for termination.
- **Other Allegations:** Forrest claims he reported illegal activity involving AWS's facial recognition technology to the UK’s House of Commons defense select committee and Serious Fraud Office in May 2023. He also alleges that Amazon broke its self-imposed moratorium on police forces using its facial recognition technology, despite a ban put in place after George Floyd's murder.
- **Amazon's Counterarguments:** The company denies Forrest made any protected disclosures and challenges the identification of information allegedly disclosed or legal obligations related to international sanctions. They also dispute that they knew what was reported to the SFO, as well as their knowledge of breaching the self-imposed moratorium on police use of facial recognition technology.

The case continues at the employment tribunal.
