# 美国制裁涉莱菲泽与奥列格·德里帕斯卡未遂交易的实体

**美国财政部** 制裁了三个实体和一名个人，他们都与 **奥地利莱菲泽银行国际公司** 和俄罗斯寡头 **奥列格·德里帕斯卡** 之间一项最近终止的资产交换交易有关。根据 **美国国务院** 的说法，被制裁方参与了一个“试图 **逃避制裁的计划**”。莱菲泽原计划收购 **Strabag** 建筑公司 25% 的股份，以换取其在俄罗斯的资产。此前，德里帕斯卡拥有这家奥地利建筑公司 25%的股份。然而，由于莱菲泽未能获得监管批准，该交易未能成功。美国于 2018 年首次对德里帕斯卡实施制裁，最近的制裁措施凸显了与俄罗斯有联系的西方企业持续面临的压力。由于 **资本管制**，莱菲泽在试图从俄罗斯撤回资产时面临挑战，而且其在该国家的利润增长也引起了审慎的关注，人们担心可能面临监管反弹。此外，该银行也面临 **欧洲中央银行** 施加的压力，要求其进一步缩减在俄罗斯的业务组合和贷款。

莱菲泽银行国际公司在国际制裁和监管压力复杂交织的大环境中努力寻求平衡，但这场未遂交易和随后的制裁措施凸显了与被制裁个人有联系的企业所面临的风险，也突出了在高度政治化的经济环境中经营所面临的挑战。

# US sanctions entities involved in Raiffeisen's aborted Oleg Deripaska deal

The **US Treasury** has sanctioned three entities and an individual connected to a recently aborted asset-swap deal involving **Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International** and the Russian oligarch **Oleg Deripaska**. The sanctioned parties were involved in an "attempted **sanctions evasion scheme**", according to the **US State Department**. Raiffeisen had planned to acquire a 25% stake in the Austrian construction company **Strabag** previously owned by Deripaska in exchange for its assets in Russia. However, the deal fell through as Raiffeisen could not get regulatory approval. The US first sanctioned Deripaska in 2018, and the recent sanctions highlight the ongoing pressure on Western businesses with Russian ties. Raiffeisen has faced challenges in its attempts to repatriate assets from Russia due to **capital controls**, and its growing profits in the country have attracted scrutiny and concerns about potential regulatory backlash. The lender is also facing pressure from the **European Central Bank** to further reduce its portfolio and lending in Russia.

Raiffeisen Bank International found itself in a difficult situation as it tried to navigate the complex landscape of international sanctions and regulatory pressures. The aborted deal and subsequent sanctions underscore the risks faced by businesses with connections to sanctioned individuals and the challenges of operating in a highly politicized economic environment.
