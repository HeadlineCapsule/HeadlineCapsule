英国国民西敏寺银行将关闭波兰业务

**国民西敏寺**计划在明年年底前关闭其在波兰的业务，这将影响该银行金融犯罪部门的大部分员工。这一决定是在一些员工完成了一个特定项目后做出的。这个过程将分两个阶段进行，是**保罗·瑟怀特**简化银行运营的一部分，其中包括在今年早些时候将执行委员会减少三分之一，以减少不必要的复杂性。

在波兰完成的金融犯罪项目侧重于了解客户流程和对客户的尽职调查。虽然波兰的员工将失去工作，但国民西敏寺61,000人的劳动力中预计将减少700到800人。该银行打算在其金融犯罪部门在英国和印度创建新的职位，目前这两个国家总共雇佣了约5,000人。

国民西敏寺的这一举措是在劳埃德银行集团在今年早些时候也对风险管理职能进行了改革之后做出的，导致150个工作岗位被裁减。自瑟怀特担任英国国民西敏寺首席执行官以来，该国对该银行的持股比例已降至22%以下。

 **NatWest** plans to close its operations in Poland by the end of next year, affecting most of the country's staff who are employed within the bank's financial crime unit. This decision follows the completion of a specific project that some employees were working on. The process will occur in two stages and is part of **Paul Thwaite**'s efforts to simplify the bank's operations, which includes reducing unnecessary complexity by cutting the executive committee by a third earlier this year.

The financial crime project completed in Poland focused on know-your-customer processes and due diligence on clients. While staff in Poland will lose their jobs, the net reduction in NatWest's 61,n000-strong workforce is estimated to be between 700 and 800 employees. The bank intends to create new positions within its financial crime unit in India and the UK, where it currently employs about 5,000 people combined.

This move by NatWest comes after Lloyds Banking Group also overhauled its risk management function earlier this year, resulting in a cut of 150 jobs. Since Thwaite took on his permanent role as the UK's top executive at NatWest, the country has reduced its stake in the bank to below 22 percent.
