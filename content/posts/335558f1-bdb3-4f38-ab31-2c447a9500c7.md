# 私募股权公司创纪录地投资印度医疗保健行业

**私募股权公司** 越来越多地投资于印度的医疗保健行业，特别是在**医院连锁和医疗公司**。这一趋势是由该国不断增长的医疗保健支出和该行业强劲的增长前景驱动的。2023 年，私募股权和风险投资对印度医疗健康和制药行业的投资达到创纪录的 55 亿美元，比上年增长 25%。像 **KKR、Blackstone 和 Bain Capital** 这样的知名公司一直在积极地在这行业寻求交易。印度经济的扩张、收入的增长和**非传染性疾病**的发病率不断上升，都是该行业具有吸引力的因素。

由于印度政府对公共医疗保健投资不足，人们不得不依赖私营部门的医疗服务，特别是低收入家庭。执政的 **印度人民党** （Bharatiya Janata Party）承诺改善医疗服务，并为低收入家庭引入了公共保险政策。然而，政府的医疗支出仍然很低，高质量的医疗保健服务分布不均。确保所有人，尤其是农村人口，获得可负担、高质量的医疗服务，仍然是一项复杂难题。尽管如此，私募股权公司仍对该行业的前景持乐观态度，预计 2024 年将完成更多交易。与 2023 年印度私人交易整体萎缩形成对比的是，医疗保健行业吸引了更多的关注，突显出该国医疗保健行业的韧性和潜力。

# Private equity targets India’s healthcare sector with record investments

**Private equity firms** are increasingly investing in India's healthcare sector, particularly in **hospital chains and medical firms**. This trend is driven by the country's rising healthcare spending and the sector's strong growth prospects. In 2023, private equity and venture capital investments in India's health and pharmaceutical sector reached a record high of $5.5 billion, a 25% increase from the previous year. Prominent firms such as **KKR, Blackstone, and Bain Capital** have been actively pursuing deals in this sector. The expanding Indian economy, rising incomes, and the growing incidence of **non-communicable diseases** are contributing factors to the sector's attractiveness.

The Indian government's underinvestment in public healthcare has resulted in a reliance on the private sector for healthcare services, particularly among low-income households. The incumbent **Bharatiya Janata Party** has promised to improve health services and introduced a public insurance policy to cover low-income households. However, government health expenditure remains low, and access to quality care is uneven. The complexity of ensuring access to affordable and quality healthcare for all, especially in rural areas, persists. Despite this, private equity firms remain optimistic about the sector's potential, and more deals are expected to close in 2024. This focus on the healthcare sector contrasts with a wider contraction in private deal-making in India in 2023, highlighting the resilience and potential of the country's healthcare industry.
