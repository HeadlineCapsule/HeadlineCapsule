# 迪士尼的流媒体成功：选择下任首席执行官的一个因素

目前担任**华特迪士尼**首席执行官第二任期的**鲍勃·查佩克**将在2026年卸任，该公司已经开始寻找他的继任者。**继任计划**已成为迪士尼董事会的首要任务，这部分是受到激进投资者**尼尔森·佩尔茨**的影响，他推动了成本削减和继任计划。尽管佩尔茨没有获得董事会席位，但他已经影响了该公司，迪士尼大举削减成本，今年股价上涨了16%。

有几位内部候选人被考虑为首席执行官人选。其中包括负责迪士尼“体验”部门（公园和游轮）的**乔什·达马罗**，以及娱乐部门联席负责人**艾伦·霍恩**和**戴娜·沃尔德曼**，他们分别监督电影和电视业务。尽管公园部门仍是迪士尼运营收入和就业的一个重要来源，但该公司预计需求将在第二季度“正常化”，在疫情后的高位之后，这可能会影响达马罗的前景。

伯格曼和沃尔德曼最近都遭遇了挫折，沃尔德曼面临传统电视业务收入下降，伯格曼则要为昂贵的电影失败负责，如《漫威》。然而，他们也为娱乐成本削减做出了贡献，这有助于改善流媒体部门的运营亏损。尽管做出了诸如向竞争对手授权内容和打击密码共享等妥协，流媒体部门的成功仍可能是首席执行官选拔过程中的决定性因素。 

查佩克在迪士尼推出流媒体服务时担任首席执行官，他认为这是一个不可避免的转变，从该部门提拔一名高管将表明该公司致力于这一业务。随着迪士尼专注于流媒体，以及查佩克对这一战略方向的的支持，与流媒体部门相关的高级管理人员可能会有很大的机会成为下一任首席执行官。

# Disney's Streaming Success: A Factor in Choosing the Next Chief Executive

**Bob Iger**, who is currently serving his second term as CEO of **Walt Disney**, will be stepping down in 2026, and the company is already looking for his successor. **Succession planning** has become a top priority for Disney's board, influenced in part by activist investor **Nelson Peltz**, who pushed for cost cuts and succession planning. While Peltz did not secure a board seat, his influence has already impacted the company, with Disney aggressively cutting costs and seeing a 16% increase in share price this year.

There are several internal candidates being considered for the CEO position. These include **Josh D'Amaro**, who heads Disney's "experiences" division (parks and cruises), and **Alan Bergman** and **Dana Walden**, co-heads of entertainment who oversee the film and TV businesses, respectively. While the parks division remains a significant source of operating income and employment for Disney, the company expects demand to "normalize" in the next quarter after a post-pandemic high, which could impact D'Amaro's prospects.

Both Bergman and Walden have had recent setbacks, with Walden facing a revenue decline in the traditional TV business and Bergman responsible for expensive film flops like "The Marvels." However, they have also contributed to entertainment cost cuts, which helped improve the streaming unit's operating loss. The streaming division's success, despite compromises such as content licensing to rivals and cracking down on password sharing, could be a deciding factor in the CEO selection process. 

Iger, who was CEO when Disney introduced streaming, views it as an inevitable shift, and promoting an executive from this division would demonstrate the company's commitment to this business. With Disney's focus on streaming and Iger's support for this strategic direction, an executive connected to the streaming division may have a strong chance of becoming the next CEO.
