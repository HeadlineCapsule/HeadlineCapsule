拉马福萨在与反对派达成协议后再次当选南非总统

**摘要：**  
西里尔·拉马福萨在与反对党达成权力共享协议后，再次当选南非总统。该协议平息了投资者的担忧，并强调经济改革以应对国家停滞不前的增长率。

作为经济中间派的拉马福萨，在2018年接替雅各布·祖马之后，在周五晚上的议会投票中以压倒性优势击败了经济自由战士党（EFF）的朱利叶斯·马勒玛。自1994年白人少数统治结束以来一直执政南非的非洲国民大会（ANC），由于未能在最近的选举中赢得多数席位，不得不与反对党达成协议。

权力共享协议包括来自民主联盟和祖鲁族主导的因卡塔自由党（IFP）的支持。随着协议的消息传出，南非兰特走强，因为市场担心ANC会与EFF或uMkhonto weSizwe等激进左翼政党结盟。

该联盟在经济改革上大力倾斜，有九个高层级优先事项来应对南非挣扎的经济。该协议被视为对国家的积极发展，为加速增长打开了大门，并强调了稳定，同时保持各党的核心信念。

 **Summary:**  
Cyril Ramaphosa was re-elected as South African president after striking a power-sharing agreement with opposition parties. The deal quells investors' fears and emphasizes economic reforms to address the country's stagnant growth rate.

Ramaphosa, an economic centrist who succeeded Jacob Zuma in 2e18, won overwhelmingly against Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party during a parliamentary vote on Friday night. The African National Congress (ANC), which has governed South Africa since the end of white minority rule in 1994, had to enter into an agreement with opposition parties due to their failure to win a majority in the recent election.

The power-sharing deal includes support from the Democratic Alliance and the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). The South African rand strengthened following news of the agreement, as markets feared an alliance between the ANC and radical left parties like EFF or uMkhonto weSizwe.

The coalition leans heavily on economic reforms with nine high-level priorities to address South Africa's struggling economy. The deal is seen as a positive development for the country, opening doors for growth acceleration and emphasizing stability while maintaining parties' core beliefs.
