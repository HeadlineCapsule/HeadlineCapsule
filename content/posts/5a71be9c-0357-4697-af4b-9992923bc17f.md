软件公司Fortnox重新公布数据，回应《金融时报》质疑

**摘要**

在《金融时报》的质疑后，瑞典软件集团 *Fortnox* 重申了关键市场份额数据。该公司低估了在瑞典会计软件市场上的主导地位，首席财务官 Roger Hartelius 承认这是一个“错误”。 Fortnox 被视作全球增长最快的技术公司之一，尽管仅在瑞典开展业务，其市值却达到 37 亿美元。

该公司最初报告了使用其服务的会计公司的数量增长，但后来澄清说，这些数字是用于其客户中一半的特殊产品。 Fortnox 现在表示，80% 的瑞典拥有 5 名或更多员工的会计公司使用他们的软件。小规模会计公司（零到四名员工）的份额从 18% 上调至 35%。

Fortnox 的市场份额数字基于对瑞典审计和会计公司总数较大的估计，导致与瑞典统计局数据不一致。该公司尚未提供进一步的历史市场份额数据或更新其 2021 年 1 月的资本市场演示文稿。

在《金融时报》发表文章考察 Fortnox 的增长以及投资者对前景和会计方法的担忧后，该公司股价下跌近 15%，使其市值减少了数亿美元。

 **Summary**

Swedish software group *Fortnox* restated key market share figures after being challenged by the Financial Times. The company had understated its dominance in Sweden's accounting software market, with CFO Roger Hartelius admitting it was a "mistake." Fortnox is viewed as one of the world's fastest-growing technology companies despite operating only within Sweden and has a $3.7bn market capitalization.

The company initially reported growth in the number of accounting firms using its services, but later clarified that these figures were for a specific product used by half its customers. Fortnox now states that 80% of Swedish accountancy firms with five or more employees use their software. The share of small accounting firms (zero to four employees) was updated from 18% to 35%.

Fortnox's market share numbers were based on a larger estimate of the total number of audit and accountancy firms in Sweden, leading to discrepancies with Statistics Sweden's figures. The company has not yet provided further historic market share data or updated its January 2021 capital markets presentation.

Following an FT article examining Fortnox's growth and investor concerns about prospects and accounting methods, the company's share price fell almost 15%, wiping hundreds of millions off its market value.
