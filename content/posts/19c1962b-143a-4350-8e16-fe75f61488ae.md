伊隆·马斯克声称他在特斯拉560亿美元的薪酬投票中获胜

# 特斯拉股东大会：埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）声称在560亿美元薪酬投票和德克萨斯州重新注册方面取得了胜利

特斯拉（Tesla）首席执行官埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）宣布，股东目前以“压倒性多数”的票数支持他560亿美元的薪酬一揽子计划，并支持将这家电动汽车制造商从特拉华州搬到德克萨斯州的提议。马斯克周三晚些时候在社交媒体平台X上公布的投票结果是初步的，但如果得到正式批准，这将被视为这位颇具争议的首席执行官的一大胜利。

2018年最初授予的560亿美元薪酬因董事会透明度和独立性问题而被特拉华州法官取消。此后，马斯克要求特斯拉将其注册地从特拉华州改为德克萨斯州，这一提议也将在年度股东大会上进行投票。如果获得批准，马斯克在公司中的股份将从13%增加到20%以上，因为他的股票期权被行使。

由于特斯拉正处于与中国电动汽车竞争对手的价格战中，并且对人工智能和机器人技术的投资不断增加，导致成本上升，因此股东对这次投票格外关注。这次投票可能对特斯拉的信誉产生重大影响。

特斯拉董事长罗宾·登霍尔姆（Robyn Denholm）领导了这两个提议的竞选活动，获得了巴克莱苏格兰抵押贷款投资信托公司（Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust）、Ark投资管理公司（Ark Investment Management）和罗恩·巴伦（Ron Baron）等主要投资者的支持。然而，马斯克的薪酬一揽子计划却引起了投资者们的争议，挪威1.7万亿美元基金因薪酬规模、结构以及未能减轻“关键人物风险”而反对该提议。

两个最大的代理投票顾问机构——ISS和Glass Lewis都建议股东拒绝马斯克的薪酬方案。在过去几周里，特斯拉加大了竞选力度，高管、工程师和零售投资者都在社交媒体上表达了对马斯克的支持。

该公司高度依赖零售投资者，他们拥有公司约30%的股份。他们的支持对这两项投票至关重要，尤其是搬迁到德克萨斯州的提议，这项提议需要获得所有未发行股份的多数票。

 **Article Summary:** Elon Musk claims victory for Tesla's $56bn pay vote and Texas reincorporation at annual meeting. 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that shareholders are currently voting in favor of his $56 billion remuneration package and a proposal to move the electric-car maker from Delaware to Texas by "wide margins." The results cited by Musk on social media platform X late Wednesday night were preliminary, but if approved formally, it would be considered a significant win for the controversial CEO.

The $56 billion pay award was initially made in 2018 but voided by a Delaware judge due to concerns over board transparency and independence. Musk has since demanded that Tesla change its incorporation location from Delaware to Texas, which is also up for vote at the annual meeting.

If approved, Musk's stake in the company would increase to more than 20% from 13%, as his stock options are exercised. The shareholder vote has been closely followed due to its potential impact on Tesla's credibility amidst a price war with Chinese electric vehicle rivals and rising costs related to investments in artificial intelligence and robotics.

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm led the campaign for both proposals, securing support from major investors like Baillie Gifford’s Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, Ark Investment Management, and Ron Baron. However, Musk's pay package has divided investors, with Norway's $1.7 trillamo fund opposing it due to its size, structure, and failure to mitigate "key person risk."

Both ISS and Glass Lewis, the two largest proxy advisers, have recommended shareholders reject Musk's pay package. Tesla has ramped up its campaign in recent weeks with executives, engineers, and retail investors expressing support for Musk on social media.

The company relies heavily on retail investors, who own about 30% of the company. Their backing is critical to both votes, especially the move to Texas, which requires a majority of all shares outstanding.
