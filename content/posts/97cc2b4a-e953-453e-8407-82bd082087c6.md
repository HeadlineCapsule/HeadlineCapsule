中国工业产出增长放缓，房地产危机拖累经济

**中国工业产出增长放缓，房地产危机影响经济**

- 中国的工业产出增长放缓至季度同比5.6%，低于预期6%和4月的6.7%。这是由正在发生的房地产危机影响经济的结果。
- 一线城市的新房价格下降3.2%，而4月为下降2.5%；住宅物业销售下跌30.5%。5月结束的前五个月，房地产投资也大幅下降10.1%。
- 政策制定者试图通过关注工业生产、基础设施投资和制造业来稳定房地产市场并加强经济稳定性。上个月，中国人民银行宣布了一项基金，以帮助地方政府购买未使用的住房库存，从而提振房地产市场。
- 5月，出口同比增长7.6%，超出预期；固定资产投资增加4%，略低于预测的4.2%。零售销售表现积极，同比增长3.7%，超过分析师的预测。
- 高盛分析师指出了中国经济中各行业之间的显著差异：强劲的出口和制造业活动、稳定的消费，但房地产部门仍然低迷。中国人民银行将一年期中期借贷便利利率维持在2.5%不变，因为较低的利率可能会影响美元汇率稳定性，而预期美国利率将保持“更高更久”。

**关键要点：**
- 中国工业产出增长放缓至5.6%，低于分析师预测和4月的6.7%。
- 房地产价格下降更加明显，一线城市上月下降3.2%；新房销售下跌30.5%，而房地产投资5月前五个月下降10.1%。
- 政策制定者专注于工业生产、基础设施投资和制造业，以在房地产市场长期低迷的情况下实现经济增长目标。
- 5月，出口同比增长7.6%，超出预期；固定资产投资增加4%，略低于预测水平；零售销售表现积极，季度同比增长3.7%，超过分析师预测。

 **Chinese Industrial Output Growth Slows Amid Property Crisis**

- China's industrial output growth slowed to 5.cuarterly, lagging behind an expected 6% in May and April's rate of 6.7%. This is a result of the ongoing property crisis affecting the economy.
- New home prices in first-tier cities fell by 3.2%, compared with a 2.5% decline in April, while residential property sales tumbled 30.5%. Property investment also saw a significant drop of 10.1% year on year for the five months ending May.
- Policymakers are attempting to stabilize the real estate market and reinforce economic stability by focusing on industrial production, infrastructure investment, and manufacturing. The central bank announced a fund last month to help local governments buy up unused housing stock in an effort to boost the property market.
- Exports rose 7.6% year on year in May, surpassing expectations, while fixed-asset investment increased by 4%, slightly below the forecasted 4.2%. Retail sales showed a positive sign with a rise of 3.7% year on year, exceeding analysts' predictions.
- Goldman Sachs analysts noted significant cross-sector divergences in China's economy: strong exports and manufacturing activity, stable consumption, but still depressed property sector. The People's Bank of China maintained the one-year medium-term lending facility rate at 2.5%, as lower rates could affect stability against the US dollar amid expectations that interest rates in the US will remain "higher for longer."
