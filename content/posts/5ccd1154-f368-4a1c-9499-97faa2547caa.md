两名员工因中国腐败指控调查后离开阿迪达斯

**阿迪达斯两名员工在腐败调查期间离职**

在对中国业务部门涉嫌挪用公款和腐败的调查之后，阿迪达斯（Adidas）有两名员工离职。这家体育用品公司仍在调查一名举报人的指控，该举报人指控高级员工从外部服务商那里收到回扣，这些费用是从营销预算中支付的。

被调查的两名员工是阿迪达斯市场营销部门的一员，其中包括一名高级管理人员。调查期间发现的证据表明，一名员工违反了公司的行为准则，而另一名员工未能达到领导层对相互尊重和信任的期望。因此，这两名员工离开了公司。

在外部顾问的协助下，阿迪达斯正在进行持续的调查，同时试图在中国市场上重振销售业绩。中国市场之前是有利可图的，但受到新冠疫情的影响，以及消费者对其在新疆棉问题上的立场所产生的负面影响。2021年，由于人权组织指控供应链中存在强迫劳动，一些西方品牌拒绝使用新疆棉，阿迪达斯面临着民族主义者对这些品牌的抵制；中国否认了这些指控。

Adrian Siu于2022年被从中国内衣市场Cosmo Lady聘回，他领导着阿迪达斯的新领导团队，致力于重新赢得中国消费者的信任和支持。引发调查的匿名信指控了包括Siu监督的一名高级经理在内的几名员工收到来自外部承包商的回扣。

举报人的指控还包括对不同部门的另一名高级经理的指控，称其“从供应商那里获得了数百万现金以及房地产等实物”。阿迪达斯预计今年将在中国市场实现两位数的销售增长率，此前该市场在2023年第四季度激增了37%。

 **Two Adidas Employees Leave Amid Corruption Investigation**

Adidas has seen two employees depart following an investigation into allegations of embezzlement and corruption within its China operations. The sportswear company is still investigating claims made by a whistleblower, who accused senior staff members of receiving kickbacks from external service providers paid out of the marketing budget.

The two employees in question were part of Adidas' marketing department and included one senior executive. Evidence found during the probe indicated that one employee violated the company's code of conduct, while another failed to meet leadership expectations regarding mutual respect and trust. Consequently, both individuals left the company.

The ongoing investigation is being conducted with external advisers as Adidas attempts to revive sales in China, a market previously profitable but impacted by the Covid-1amo pandemic and consumer backlash over its stance on Xinjiang cotton. In 2021, Adidas faced a nationalist boycott of western brands that rejected cotton from Xinjiang due to allegations of forced labor in the supply chain by human rights groups; China has denied these claims.

Adrian Siu, who was hired back from Chinese lingerie market Cosmo Lady in 2022, leads a new leadership team at Adidas with a commitment to regaining the trust and support of Chinese consumers. The anonymous letter that sparked the investigation accused several employees, including one senior manager overseen by Siu, of receiving kickbacks from external contractors.

The whistleblower's allegations also included claims against another senior manager in a different department, stating they had "millions in cash from suppliers and physical items such as real estate." Adidas expects to see double-digit sales growth rates in China this year after experienebly surging by 37% in the fourth quarter of 2023.
