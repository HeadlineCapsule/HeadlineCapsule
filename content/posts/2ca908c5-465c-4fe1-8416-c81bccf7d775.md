# **里西·苏纳克** 计划打击学生签证推销员

**英国首相里西·苏纳克** 计划宣布打击在海外推销毕业生签证计划的中介机构，以在即将到来的大选前控制移民。尽管大学监管机构警告称，由于国际学生人数下降，大学的财务状况已经十分糟糕，但苏纳克还是做出了这一决定。新措施可能将于下周宣布，包括强制性中介机构注册计划和对不良行为的罚款。**苏纳克** 还考虑将毕业生计划调整为只向“**最优秀和最聪明的人**”提供签证，尽管这一决定由于内阁成员担心教育部门的财务负担进一步加重而面临阻力。这一宣布可能将与季度移民数据的发布同时进行。**教育大臣吉莲·基根** 支持采取措施解决中介机构涉嫌“滥用”问题，但反对任何以学生质量或学位类型为依据限制学生入境的举措。**英国政府移民问题独立顾问** 和 **移民咨询委员会** 建议保持目前的签证计划不变，但**苏纳克** 面临其政党内部的压力，要求减少合法移民。这些措施对大学和企业的潜在影响令人担忧，前 **保守党大学部长乔·约翰逊** 警告称这将是对一个具有竞争力部门的“狭

# Rishi Sunak Plans Crackdown on Student Visa Salesmen 

**Rishi Sunak**, the UK **Prime Minister**, is planning to announce a **crackdown on agents** who market **graduate visa schemes** overseas as an attempt to curb migration before the upcoming general election. This decision comes despite warnings from the university regulator about the already dire financial position of universities due to a fall in international student numbers. The new measures, which may be announced as early as next week, could include a mandatory agent registration scheme and fines for bad practices. **Sunak** is also considering adapting the graduate scheme to only offer visas to the "**best and brightest**", although this decision is facing resistance from cabinet members over concerns of further financial strain on the education sector. The announcement is likely to be timed with the release of quarterly migration data. **Gillian Keegan**, the **Education Secretary**, supports measures to address alleged "abuse" by agents but resists any moves to limit access based on student quality or degree type. The **UK government's independent adviser on migration** and the **Migration Advisory Committee** have recommended keeping the current visa scheme intact, but **Sunak** is facing pressure from his party to reduce legal migration. The potential impact of these measures on universities and businesses is a concern, with former **Conservative universities minister Jo Johnson** warning of a "narrowly party political and non-evidence-based assault" on a competitive sector.
