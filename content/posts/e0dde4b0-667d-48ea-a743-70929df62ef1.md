是时候“分手”了：司法部起诉 Live Nation

# 亿万富翁对矿业巨头施压，推动公司结构统一

一篇文章重点介绍了**对冲基金埃利奥特管理公司**在2017年向当时世界上最大的矿业公司**必和必拓**施压，要求其放弃双重公司架构，统一在一个证券交易所上市。该活动的领导者是亿万富翁詹姆斯·史密斯，他是埃利奥特管理公司的投资者，他认为单一上市公司将有更大的灵活性来追求以股票支付的收购。2021年，必和必拓宣布将其主要上市地点从伦敦转移到悉尼，后来以全股交易的方式向英国竞争对手英美集团提出了近400亿英镑的收购要约。

如今，**派西菲克资本公司**詹姆斯·史密斯正领导另一场活动，敦促全球矿业巨头**力拓集团**统一其双重结构。他认为此举将使力拓公司的股价上涨近40%，并使其能够更轻松地参与影响该行业的主要并购交易。然而，与必和必拓的情况相比，存在着关键差异：约77%的力拓公司股份由其在英国公司的投资者持有，这可能使其统一结构更加困难。

文章还提到，在法院下令调查后，代表FTX进行破产程序的华尔街精英律师事务所**沙利文-克伦威尔**被免除了利益冲突嫌疑，可以继续担任其法律顾问。

The article highlights a push by activist hedge fund Elliott Management in 2017 for BHP, the world's largest miner at that time, to abandon its dual corporate structure and unify under one stock market listing. The campaign was led by James Smith, an investor of Elliott Management, who argued that a single-listed company would have greater flexibility in pursuing acquisitions paid with stock. In 2021, BHP announced it would shift its primary listing from London to Sydney and later made a nearly £40bn all-share takeover bid for UK rival Anglo American.

Now, Palliser Capital's James Smith is leading another campaign urging Rio Tinto, the world'amoor mining company, to unify its dual structure. He believes that this move would result in a nearly 40% upside in Rio's shares and enable it to more easily participate in major M&A deals shaping the sector. However, there are key differences compared to BHP's case: about 77% of Rio's share capital is held by investors in its UK company, making a unified structure potentially more challenging.

The article also mentions that Sullivan & Cromwell, an elite Wall Street law firm representing FTX during bankruptcy proceedings, was cleared of conflicts of interest and allowed to continue their representation after a court-ordered investigation.
