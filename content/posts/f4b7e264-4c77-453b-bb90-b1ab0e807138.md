# 好猫还是坏猫？ 

基思·吉尔（Keith Gill）在 Twitter 上使用的网名 **Roaring Kitty** 在长期缺席后突然重新出现，在股市中引发轰动，并导致 **迷因股**（meme stocks）如 GameStop 和 AMC 的股价飙升。这一事件提醒人们，社交媒体和散户投资者可以对股价产生影响，即使根本原因似乎并不理性。尽管吉尔的推文导致市场波动可以归因于挤仓等因素，但也反映了投资者谨慎乐观的情绪，这一点在 **花旗李维科夫情绪指数**（Citi's Levkovich sentiment index）中有所体现。尽管股价和估值很高，但公用事业股的表现和 AI 炒作股等传统市场疯狂指标显示，市场相对理性。然而，消费者情绪仍然低迷，这可能会抑制市场中不理性繁荣。这篇文章还强调了企业债券前所未有的需求，这可能归因于其较国债更高的收益率，以及这一趋势的潜在风险和回报。

# Good Kitty or Bad Kitty? 

**Roaring Kitty**, the online persona of Keith Gill, made a sudden reappearance on Twitter after a long absence, causing a stir in the stock market and a surge in **meme stocks** like GameStop and AMC. This event serves as a reminder of the influence that social media and retail investors can have on stock prices, even when the underlying reasons may seem irrational. While the market's reaction to Gill's tweet can be explained by factors like short squeezes, it also reflects a broader sentiment of cautious optimism among investors, as indicated by the **Citi's Levkovich index**. Despite high valuations and prices, traditional indicators of market insanity, such as the performance of utilities and AI hype stocks, show a relatively sane market. However, consumer sentiment remains low, which could act as a counterbalance to irrational exuberance in the markets. The article also highlights the unprecedented demand for corporate bonds, which may be attributed to their higher yields compared to Treasuries, and the potential risks and rewards of this trend.
