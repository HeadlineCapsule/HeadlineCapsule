北约仅拥有保护东翼所需防空力量的5%

# 北约内部计算显示，欧洲仅拥有保护其东部边界所需防空能力的5%，突显出在发生战争时存在的重大漏洞。在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰期间，基辅寻求额外的系统和火箭进行保护，从而突显了防空的重要性。北约国家目前无法提供超过所需能力的一小部分来保卫中欧和东欧免受大规模袭击，一些欧洲领导人甚至提出俄罗斯可能在十年结束前攻击一个北约成员国。

## 有趣的问题：

1. **问题：北约有限的防空能力对其中欧和东欧成员有何影响？**
答案：有限的防空能力意味着北约抵御导弹和空袭的能力受到严重削弱，使其成员国容易受到潜在袭击的影响。这可能会导致联盟内部的紧张局势加剧，因为各国都在寻求加强防御或依靠其他成员保护的方法。

2. **问题：北约目前在防空方面的不足如何影响其对俄罗斯的整体威慑战略？**
答案：缺乏足够的防空能力可能削弱北约的威慑态势，因为像俄罗斯这样的对手可能会认为联盟没有做好充分自卫的准备。这种看法可能会壮大对手的胆量，导致在有北约成员国参与的地区采取侵略行动或升级冲突。

3. **问题：北约可以采取哪些措施来解决其防空不足的问题并增强其整体安全态势？**
答案：为解决当前局限性，北约可以采取多项措施，例如增加对战斗机等新型防空能力的投资；通过德国的“天空盾牌”计划或法国的竞争对手概念等倡议开发共享系统；整合欧洲各地的各种防空系统，在欧洲大陆创建一个由传感器和拦截器组成的密集网格；以及更新防空指挥和控制基础设施。此外，还可以考虑探索共同举债为国防项目提供资金等选项。

**Summary:**  
NATO's internal calculations reveal that Europe has only 5% of the necessary air defense capabilities required to protect its eastern flank, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in case of war. The importance of air defense was emphasized during Russia'n invasion against Ukraine as Kyiv sought additional systems and rockets for protection. NATO states are currently unable to provide more than a fraction of the needed capacities to defend central and eastern Europe from full-scale attacks, with some European leaders suggesting that Russia could attack a NATO member state by the end of the decade.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. **Q: What are the implications of NATO's limited air defense capabilities for its members in central and eastern Europe?**  
A: The limited air defense capabilities mean that NATO's ability to defend against missiles and air strikes is severely compromised, leaving member states vulnerable to potential attacks. This could lead to increased tensions within the alliance as countries seek ways to bolster their defenses or rely on other members for protection.
2. **Q: How might NATO's current shortcomings in air defense impact its overall deterrence strategy against Russia?**  
A: The lack of sufficient air defense capabilities could weaken NATO's deterrence posture, as it may be perceived by adversaries like Russia that the alliance is not fully prepared to defend itself. This perception might embolden aggressive actions or escalate conflicts in regions where NATO members are involved.
3. **Q: What steps can NATO take to address its air defense shortcomings and enhance its overall security posture?**  
A: To address the current limitations, NATO could pursue several measures such as increasing investments in new air defense capabilities like fighter jets, developing shared systems through initiatives like Germany's Sky Shield program or France's rival concept, integrating various European air defense systems to create a dense mesh of sensors and interceptors across the continent, and updating command and control infrastructure for air defense. Additionally, exploring options such as raising common debt to fund defense projects could also be considered.
