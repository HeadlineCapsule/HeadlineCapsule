英超俱乐部预计将创造集体收入纪录

# 英超俱乐部预计将创纪录地集体收入

由于欧洲比赛的变化、票价上涨、体育场容量和国际广播协议，**英格兰英超联赛** 俱乐部预计将在下个赛季报告创纪录的收入。根据德勤最新的足球财务年度审查：

 - 英格兰顶级联赛的 20 支球队在 2024-25 年共同创造的收入预计近 **64 亿英镑**，比上个赛季增长近 7%。
 - 英超联赛国际媒体权利分配的增加以及多家俱乐部的新赞助协议将使广播收入上升。
 - 由于多年相对停滞后票价上涨，商业收入预计将增长。新晋升球队南安普顿的体育场比最近降级的卢顿镇更大。
 - 在英超联赛和许多俱乐部就成本控制和违反亏损限额的处罚争论不休之际，这些预测提供了可喜的提振。

对于 2023-24 年，德勤预计收入将保持平稳或略有下降，约为 **60 亿英镑**，因为英格兰球队在欧洲比赛中的表现不佳。然而，本赛季生效的新欧足联比赛形式预计将带来更多比赛并增加英格兰参赛队的收入。

盈利能力仍然是英超联赛大多数球队难以捉摸的：2022-23 年，预税亏损合计 **6.85 亿英镑**，比上个赛季增长 14%。尽管如此，该赛季俱乐部 60 亿英镑的收入远超德国竞争对手产生的 38 亿欧元，是最近的竞争对手。

德勤体育业务集团的领头合伙人蒂姆·布里奇 (Tim Bridge) 表示，新一代“越来越商业化”的投资者和所有者正在努力在财务可持续性和满足球迷对比赛表现的期望之间取得平衡。然而，联盟首席执行官理查德·马斯特斯 (Richard Masters) 警告说，英国政府计划引入独立监管机构可能会削弱与欧洲对手的竞争。

人们对英超联赛财务法规的未来出现了严重分歧：

 - 该规则对俱乐部在三个赛季的总损失设定了 1.05 亿英镑的上限，并对某些投资有例外规定。
 - 埃弗顿和诺丁汉森林在上个赛季因违反支出规则而被扣除积分，而曼城仍在向冠军联赛提出异议。
 - 下个赛季，联盟及其俱乐部将与现有规则一起测试财务监管的两个新方法。

 # English Premier League Clubs Forecast Record Collective Revenues

The **English Premier League** clubs are projected to report record revenues for the upcoming season, driven by changes to European competitions, higher ticket prices, stadium capacity and international broadcast deals. According to Deloitte's latest annual review of football finance:

- The 20 teams in the English top flight together are forecast to generate nearly **£6.4bn** of revenues in 2024-25, up almost 7% from the previous season.
- Increases in Premier League international media rights distributions and new sponsorship deals for several clubs will see broadcast revenues rise.
- Commercial revenue is expected to boost due to higher ticket prices after years of relative stasis. Newly promoted teams such as Southampton have larger stadiums than Luton Town, which was relegated in the most recent season.
- The projections provide a welcome boost at a time when the Premier League and many clubs are squabbling over cost controls and punishments for breaching loss limits.

For 2023-24, Deloitte expects flat to slightly lower revenues of about **£6bn** due to English sides' underperformance in European competitions. However, new UEFA competition formats coming into play this season are expected to result in more matches and boost revenues for English participants.

Profitability remains elusive for most teams in the Premier League: there were combined pre-tax losses of **£685mn** in 2022-23, an increase of 14% on the prior season. Still, the clubs' £6bn revenue that season was far ahead of the €3.8bn generated by German rivals, the nearest contenders.

Tim Bridge, lead partner at Deloitte’s sports business group, said the new generation of “increasingly business-minded” investors and owners are trying to find a balance between financial sustainability and meeting fans' expectations for performances on the pitch. However, league chief executive Richard Masters has warned that UK government plans to introduce an independent regulator could weaken competition against European rivals.

Fierce divisions have emerged over the future of the Premier League’s own financial regulations:
- The rules place a cap on total losses at a club over three seasons at £105mn with exceptions for some investments.
- Everton and Nottingham Forest were handed points deductions last season for breaching spending rules, while Manchester City is still challenging the league over charges against the champions.
- The league and its clubs will test two new approaches to financial regulation next season alongside existing rules.
