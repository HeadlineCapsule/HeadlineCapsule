# 为什么立陶宛考虑向乌克兰派遣士兵

**立陶宛总理** **英格丽达·希莫尼特** 透露，她的国家准备向乌克兰派遣士兵，执行**训练任务**，以示继续支持乌克兰抗击俄罗斯。 此行动恰逢其他欧洲国家，以**法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙**为首，考虑派遣军队，尽管可能与俄罗斯发生直接对抗。希莫尼特承认了挑衅的风险，但强调了不因俄罗斯反应而退缩的重要性。 立陶宛的提议已获议会授权，现待基辅方面提出请求。

俄罗斯对这一潜在部署的**反应**是关键问题。 俄罗斯最近在马克龙提议后进行了**战术核武器**演习，但希莫尼特认为俄罗斯因会受到影响而不会使用此类武器。 相反，俄罗斯加大了对乌克兰民用基础设施的攻击，旨在破坏基本公用设施和服务，引发新一波难民潮。 希莫尼特还谈到了立陶宛在遣返作战年龄男子回乌克兰问题上的立场，强调了欧盟授予的法律保护，直至 2025 年 3 月，并否认了任何关于驱逐出境的计划。

该文章还报道了席卷欧洲的**学生抗议**活动，要求大学**切断与以色列的联系**，因为以色列在加沙的军事行动。 抗议活动发生在柏林自由大学、阿姆斯特丹大学和巴黎政治大学等知名大学，当局做出了不同的反应。 一些大学采取了法律行动并驱散了抗议者，而另一些大学，如都柏林圣三一学院，则表达了对学生的支持。 这些抗议活动引发了关于言论自由和学术机构在对国际冲突采取立场方面的作用的辩论。

# Why Lithuania is considering sending soldiers to Ukraine

**Lithuania's Prime Minister** **Ingrida Šimonytė** has revealed that her country is prepared to send soldiers to Ukraine on a **training mission**, in a show of continued support for Ukraine's struggle against Russia. This move comes as other European countries, led by **French President Emmanuel Macron**, consider sending troops, despite the potential for direct confrontation with Russia. Šimonytė acknowledges the risk of provocation but emphasizes the importance of not being deterred by Russian responses. Lithuania's offer, authorized by its parliament, awaits Kyiv's request.

**Russia's reaction** to this potential deployment is a key concern. Russia recently conducted drills with **tactical nuclear weapons** following Macron's proposal, though Šimonytė believes the use of such weapons is unlikely due to the fallout affecting Russia as well. Instead, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, aiming to degrade basic utilities and services and trigger a new wave of refugees. Šimonytė also addresses Lithuania's stance on returning men of fighting age to Ukraine, underlining the legal protection granted by the EU until March 2025 and denying any plans for deportations.

The article also covers the spread of **student protests** across Europe, demanding that universities **cut ties with Israel** due to its military operations in Gaza. Protests have been held at prominent universities, including Berlin's Freie Universität, the University of Amsterdam, and Sciences Po Paris, with varying responses from authorities. While some universities have taken legal action and dispersed protesters, others, like Trinity College Dublin, have expressed solidarity with the students. The protests have sparked debates about free speech and the role of academic institutions in taking a stand on international conflicts.
