# 泰晤士水务公司最大股东注销投资

**泰晤士水务公司**（Thames Water）是英国最大的水务供应商，目前正面临着日益严重的财务危机。其最大的股东，即**注册于新加坡的子公司**——**安大略省市政员工退休金计划**（**OMERS**）已注销其投资。此举发生之际，泰晤士水务公司正苦于**180亿英镑债务**的重压，并急需大量现金注入以维持运营和交付必要的基础设施改善。该公司一直与监管机构陷入各种争议，包括**水费**、**罚款**和**股息**等问题，且未能在其业务计划上达成共识。形势已经恶化到专家预测政府将进行干预，暂时重新国有化的可能性也越来越大。持有泰晤士水务公司**31%的股份**的OMERS，通过完全核销其投资，发出了对该公司未来前景不确定的信号。这一决定，加上OMERS的代表最近从公用事业董事会中退出，使得人们更加担忧该公司财务状况。而泰晤士水务公司第二大股东，**大学超级年金计划**（Universities Superannuation Scheme）的沉默，也加剧了人们的担忧。该公司财务困境进一步恶化，因为其母公司肯布尔（Kemble）最近违约债务，股东也不愿注入股本。因此，泰晤士水务公司在寻求新投资者的道路上面临着挑战，而其现金储备却在不断减少。

# Thames Water’s biggest shareholder writes off investment 

**Thames Water**, the UK's largest water supplier, is facing a deepening financial crisis as its biggest shareholder, a **Singapore-registered subsidiary** of the **Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System** (**OMERS**), has written off its investment. This move comes as Thames Water struggles with the weight of its **£18 billion debt** and the need for a substantial cash injection to continue operations and deliver essential infrastructure improvements. The company has been locked in disputes with regulators over various issues, including **water bills**, **fines**, and **dividends**, and has failed to reach a consensus on its business plan. The situation is so dire that experts predict government intervention, with the possibility of temporary renationalization, becoming increasingly likely. OMERS, which holds a significant **31 percent stake** in Thames Water, has signaled its lack of confidence in the company's future by fully writing down its investment. This decision is compounded by the recent withdrawal of OMERS' representative from the utility's board. With Thames Water's second-biggest shareholder, the **Universities Superannuation Scheme**, remaining silent, concerns over the company's financial health are mounting. The situation is further exacerbated by the recent default on debt by Thames Water's parent group, Kemble, and the reluctance of shareholders to inject equity. As a result, Thames Water is facing a challenging path ahead, seeking new investors while its cash reserves diminish.
