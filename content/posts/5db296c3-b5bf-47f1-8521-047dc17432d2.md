安联欺诈案主犯认罪

**安联首席基金经理在60亿美元欺诈案中认罪**

安联集团（Allianz）的领头基金经理格雷戈里·图纳（Gregoire Tournant）因与该集团60亿美元和解协议相关的投资顾问欺诈罪认罪。该计划涉及在2020年大流行期间遭受重创的投资策略中，向投资者隐瞒风险。

图纳是安联全球投资者前首席基金经理，其所管理的基金在峰值时期资产总价值达110亿美元，但在2020年遭受了巨大损失。周五，他承认了两项投资顾问欺诈罪，并将在10月被判刑。

美国当局指控图纳和其他管理人员通过低估基金承担的风险、高估监督水平以及发送篡改的风险报告来欺骗投资者。认罪协议是多年来对安联集团美国资产管理部门金融犯罪调查的成果。

图纳同意没收约1700万美元的薪酬或推迟支付的薪酬。作为和解协议的一部分，基金投资者将得到全额赔偿。该丑闻引发了对全球最大保险集团之一控制功能的担忧，并导致安联首席执行官道歉。

美国司法部发现结构性产品小组的控制措施存在重大漏洞，但没有发现证据表明该小组之外的人员知道这些不当行为。该案件凸显了金融机构透明度、监督和问责制的重要性，以保护投资者免受欺诈计划的影响。

 **Allianz Lead Fund Manager Pleads Guilty in $6bn Fraud Case**

The lead fund manager at Allianz, Gregoire Tournant, has pleaded guilty to investment adviser fraud related to a scandal that resulted in a $6 billion settlement between Germany's Allianz and US authorities. The scheme involved hiding risks from investors in an investment strategy that suffered heavy losses during the 202amo pandemic sell-off.

Tournant, who was the former lead manager of funds at Allianz Global Investors marketed as being able to withstand a market crash, amassed $11 billion at their peak before incurring significant losses in 2020. He pleaded guilty on Friday to two counts of investment adviser fraud and is due to be sentenced in October.

US authorities allege that Tournant and the other managers lied to investors by understating risks taken by the funds, overstating oversight levels, and sending altered risk reports. The guilty plea marks the culmination of a multiyear investigation into financial crimes within Allianz's US asset management unit.

Tournant has agreed to forfeit approximately $17 million in compensation paid or deferred. As part of the settlement, funds' investors will be made whole. The scandal raised concerns over control functions at one of the world's largest insurance groups and led to an apology from Allianz's chief executive.

The US Department of Justice found significant gaps in controls within the structured-products group but did not find evidence that individuals outside this group were aware of the misconduct. The case highlights the importance of transparency, oversight, and accountability in financial institutions to protect investors from fraudulent schemes.
