珍妮特·耶伦称许多美国人仍在苦于通胀

## 美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）在接受《金融时报》采访时表示，她担心持续的通货膨胀会导致生活成本大幅上升，这给许多美国人带来影响。尽管工资增长强劲，拜登政府也努力降低成本，但住房、食品和汽油价格居高不下仍然是一个重大问题。民意调查显示，由于通胀仍是选民在11月选举前的首要关注之一，因此他们并不认可拜登在近期美国经济表现方面的功劳。

- **耶伦**表示，尽管有强劲的工资增长，但**住房、食品和汽油价格**居高不下仍然是影响许多人的“**实质性问题**”。

- 民意调查显示，由于选民仍然非常关注通货膨胀问题，他们并没有因为美国经济表现而给拜登政府加分。

- 共和党人批评了拜登政府的气候政策和其他一些他们认为推高价格的政策，并借此抨击民主党远离普通民众。

## Summary:
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, **US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen** expressed concern over "substantial increases" in living costs due to persistent inflation affecting many Americans. Despite strong wage growth and efforts by President Joe Biden's administration to reduce costs, high prices for housing, food, and petrol remain a significant issue. Polls show that voters do not credit Biden with the US economy's recent performance, as inflation remains one of their top concerns ahead of November's election.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How has President Joe Biden's administration attempted to address the rising cost of living for Americans? 
A1: The article mentions that President Biden and his team have taken steps such as eliminating "junk fees" that add extra charges on US consumers. Additionally, Biden has blamed companies for profit-gouging and "shrinkflation," where manufacturers downgrade a product's size or quality but charge the same price.

Q2: What factors have contributed to the higher inflation rates in the United States compared to other countries? 
A2: The article suggests that most economists view the surge in prices as primarily a global phenomenon, driven by pandemic-related shortages for certain goods and geopolitical factors such as oil price rises. However, US inflation has proven stickier than elsewhere, with some attributing it to the country's strong labor market or aggressive fiscal stimulus from both Biden and Trump administrations.

Q3: How have Republicans responded to voters' concerns over high prices in relation to President Joe Biden's policies? 
A3: The article states that Republicans have seized on voters' concerns about high prices, criticizing Biden for climate and other policies they claim have pushed up prices. They depict Democrats as out of touch with ordinary people by pointing to the administration's handling of inflation-related issues.
