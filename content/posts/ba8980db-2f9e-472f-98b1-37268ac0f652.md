美国大型银行通过美联储“压力测试”的年检

# 联邦储备银行的年度压力测试结果显示，美国大型银行经受住了严重经济衰退的考验

**新闻摘要：**

联邦储备银行对美国大型银行进行的年度压力测试结果显示，包括摩根大通、高盛和美洲银行在内的所有 31 家大型金融机构都成功通过了理论上的严重经济衰退场景考验。此次测试模拟了失业率上升到 10%、商业房地产价格下跌 40%、办公空置率大幅上升以及房价下跌 36% 的情况。尽管面临这些严峻的挑战，但银行仍将符合监管的最低标准，预计损失近 6,850 亿美元。压力测试旨在确保大型银行在高度紧张的场景中拥有足够的资本来吸收损失。

测试结果显示，美国银行的一级资本充足率将下降 2.8 个百分点，这是 2018 年以来的最大降幅。今年的测试还突显了信用卡贷款和企业贷款组合相关的风险增加。此外，一个单独的场景模拟了五个大型对冲基金倒闭的影响，结果显示最复杂的银行可能损失 130 亿美元至 220 亿美元。

自 2008 年金融危机后引入年度压力测试以来，它们在重建人们对银行业的信心方面发挥了重要作用。然而，一些专家认为这些测试可能无法准确反映现实世界中的情况，并且过于关注资本缓冲区而忽视了其他关键因素。美联储提出的巴塞尔协议 III 最终资本规则（Basel III Endgame capital rules）面临着大型美国银行的反对，监管机构正在考虑对该规则进行潜在的修改。

**要点：**

1. 美国 31 家大型银行全部通过了今年联邦储备银行在严重经济衰退场景下的压力测试。

2. 测试模拟了失业率达到 10%、商业房地产价格下跌 40% 和房价下跌 36% 的理论场景。

3. 银行仍将符合监管的最低标准，但一级资本充足率将下降 2.8 个百分点，这是 2018 年以来的最大降幅。

4. 压力测试旨在确保银行在高度紧张的场景中拥有足够的资本来吸收损失。

5. 一些专家认为这些测试可能无法准确反映现实世界中的情况，并且过于关注资本缓冲区而忽视了其他关键因素。

6. 美联储提出的巴塞尔协议 III 最终资本规则（Basel III Endgame capital rules）面临着大型美国银行的反对，该规则将增加对大型美国银行的资本要求。

 **Article Summary:**  
The Federal Reserve's annual stress tests for US banks revealed that all 31 of the largest institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, successfully withstood a theoretical scenario involving severe recession conditions. The test involved unemployment rising to 10%, commercial real estate prices dropping by amo
ut 40%, office vacancies increasing substantially, and house prices falling by 36%. Despite these challenging circumstances, the banks would still meet regulatory minimum standards with a projected loss of nearly $685 billion. The stress tests aim to ensure that large banks have sufficient capital to absorb losses in highly stressful scenarios.

The results showed that tier one capital ratios for US banks would decrease by 2.8 percentage points, the largest drop since 2018. This year's test also highlighted increased risks associated with credit card loans and corporate loan books. Additionally, a separate scenario examining the impact of five large hedge funds failing showed that the most complex banks could lose between $13 billion and $22 billion in aggregate.

The annual stress tests have been instrumental since their introduction after the 2008 financial crisis to rebuild confidence in the banking sector. However, some experts argue that these tests may not accurate real-world scenarios and focus on capital buffers rather than other critical factors. The Fed's proposed Basel III Endgame capital rules have faced opposition from large US banks, with potential changes being considered by regulators.

**Key Points:**  
1. All 31 of the largest US banks passed this year's Federal Reserve stress tests under severe recession conditions.
2. The test involved a theoretical scenario with unemployment at 10%, commercial real estate prices dropping by up to 40%, and house prices falling by 36%.
3. Banks would still meet regulatory minimum standards, but tier one capital ratios would decrease by 2.8 percentage points - the largest drop since 2018.
4. The stress tests aim to ensure banks have sufficient capital to absorb losses in highly stressful scenarios.
5. Some experts argue that these tests may not accurately reflect real-world situations and focus on capital buffers rather than other critical factors.
6. The Fed's proposed Basel III Endgame capital rules, which would increase capital requirements for large US banks, have faced opposition from the banking industry.
