被制裁的亿万富翁可能从有争议的美刚协议中获得3亿美元

**新闻摘要：**
美国正在考虑一项有争议的提案，该提案将放宽对以色列亿万富翁丹·格尔特尔的制裁。自2017年以来，他因涉嫌在刚果民主共和国（DRC）的腐败交易而受到限制。该计划涉及允许格尔特尔将其剩余采矿权益的 royalty 流卖回刚果政府。

**要点：**
- Dan Gertler是一位以色列亿万富翁，由于涉嫌在刚果进行腐败交易，自2017年以来被美国制裁，现在他可能从华盛顿的一项有争议的提案中获得约3亿美元。
- 该计划涉及财政部提供“特殊”许可证，将三项 royalty 流卖回刚果政府，并最终向格尔特尔授予进入美国金融体系的“一般”许可证。
- 批评者认为，取消对格尔特尔的制裁会破坏美国制裁制度的可信度，而支持者则认为这可能会为美国友好的公司创造更多机会进入刚果的采矿部门。
- 刚果民主共和国是钴和铜的重要来源，其采矿业主要由中国公司主导。
- 格尔特尔于1997年作为钻石商人抵达该国，并通过与前总统约瑟夫·卡比拉（Joseph Kabila）的密切关系在刚果采矿业积累了巨大的权力和影响力。他获得了有利可图的矿产资产，并与国际公司建立了合作伙伴关系，包括瑞士商品交易商嘉能可（Glencore）和哈萨克斯坦采矿集团ENRC。
- 美国财政部指控格尔特尔在他的公司进行腐败交易，仅在2010年至2012年就使刚果国家损失了超过13.6亿美元的收入，而他本人则否认这一指控。
- 根据拟议的计划，格尔特尔将保留每个项目销售额约2.5%的 royalty 流，但会出售他在嘉能可两家采矿项目——卡莫托（Kamoto）和穆坦达（Mutanda）的股权。这些 royalty 流的现值取决于关于矿山寿命、生产水平、金属价格和未来现金流折扣率的假设。
- 美国官员估计，格尔特尔去年从 royalty 支付中赚了约1.2亿美元，并以欧元接收以避免制裁。刚果政府已向格尔特尔的代表分享了该提案，但后者尚未回应。

 **Article Summary:**  
The US is considering a controversial proposal that would ease sanctions on Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, who has been under restrictions since 201amo for alleged corrupt dealings in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The plan involves allowing Gertler to sell his remaining mining interests' royalty streams back to the Congolese government.

**Key Points:**  
- Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire under US sanctions since 2017 for alleged corrupt dealings in Congo, could receive around $300 million from a controversial proposal by Washington.
- The plan involves the Treasury providing "special" licenses to sell three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and eventually granting Gertler a "general" license for access to the US financial system.
- Critics argue that lifting sanctions on Gertler would undermine the credibility of the US sanctions regime, while supporters believe it could create more opportunities for US-friendly companies in Congo's mining sector.
- The DRC is a significant source of cobalt and copper, with its mining sector dominated by Chinese companies.
- Gertler arrived in the country as a diamond trader in 1 groveler under sanctions imposed by the US Treasury for alleged corrupt dealings in Congo since 2017. He retains lucrative royalty streams from three mining projects there, which are expected to be sold back to the Congolese government as part of a controversial proposal by Washington.
- The total amount Gertler would receive is yet to be decided but estimated at around $300 million. Critics argue that lifting sanctions on him could undermine the credibility of the US sanctions regime, while supporters believe it could create more opportunities for US-friendly companies in Congo's mining sector.
- The DRC is a significant source of cobalt and copper, with its mining sector dominated by Chinese companies.
- Gertler arrived in the country as a diamond trader in 1997 and amassed huge power and influence in Congo's mining sector through close ties with former president Joseph Kabila. He secured access to lucrative mineral assets and partnerships with international companies, including Swiss commodities house Glencore and Kazakh mining group ENRC.
- The US Treasury has accused Gertler of corrupt transactions involving his companies that cost the Congolese state more than $1.36 billion in revenues between 2010 and 2012 alone, which he denies.
- Under the proposed plan, Gertler would retain royalty streams worth approximately 2.5% of sales from each project but sell his equity stakes in two Glencore mining projects, Kamoto and Mutanda. The present value of these royalty streams depends on assumptions about mine life, production levels, metal prices, and discount rates for future cash flows.
- US officials estimate that Gertler earned about $120 million from the royalty payments last year, received in euros to avoid sanctions. The Congolese government has shared the proposal with Gertler's representatives, who have yet to respond.
