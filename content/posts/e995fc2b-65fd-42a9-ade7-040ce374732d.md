# 吉勒斯·德拉尔特（Gilles Dellaert）：“我们正在目睹一场结构性转变”

**黑石集团**（Blackstone）信贷业务负责人**吉勒斯·德拉尔特**讨论了贷款从**银行资产负债表**迁移到**资产管理公司**的趋势，以及私人信贷在这场转变中所扮演的角色。德拉尔特强调，融资市场正在发生一场结构性转变，转向**私人融资**，特别是在**非投资级**领域，私募股权投资公司正在避开传统的杠杆贷款或公开市场，转而寻求私人解决方案。这一趋势现已扩展到**私人投资级**贷款，基础设施和消费设备融资等领域正吸引着大量兴趣。

德拉尔特将这一转变归因于不断演变的**银行资本规则**，以及私募股权引领的融资中对**执行确定性**和**承销复杂性**的需求。他还强调了私人信贷对借贷双方的好处，包括加强银行资产负债表、增强资本获取能力，以及为投资者提供更好的利差。

在被问及保险公司在私人信贷中的角色时，德拉尔特指出，黑石集团选择与多家保险公司合作，而不是自己拥有保险公司。这种开放架构的方法与黑石集团的资产管理DNA相一致，使他们能够为不同类型的客户提供服务。

关于风险调整后的回报，德拉尔特承认，由于所涉及的工作和流动性差，私人信贷获得了溢价。然而，他强调，流动性的概念正在演变，负有长期负债的投资者正在重新评估他们对流动性资产的需求。

德拉尔特还回应了关于私人信贷中潜在泡沫的担忧。他认为，总体的杠杆率低于金融危机之前，黑石集团非投资级业务中的违约率也显著低于公开市场。

最后，在考虑利率上升的影响时，德拉尔特认为，与融资市场的结构性转变相比，利率走向对他们的业务影响较小。

# Gilles Dellaert: 'We're seeing a structural shift' 

**Gilles Dellaert**, head of Blackstone's credit operations, discusses the growing trend of loans migrating from **bank balance sheets** to **asset managers** and the role of private credit in this shift. Dellaert highlights the structural shift in financing markets towards **private financing**, particularly in the **non-investment grade** space, where private equity sponsors are turning to private solutions instead of traditional leveraged loans or public markets. This trend is now expanding into **private investment-grade** lending, with areas like infrastructure and consumer equipment finance attracting significant interest. 

Dellaert attributes this shift to evolving **bank capital rules** and the desire for **certainty of execution** and **underwriting complexity** in private equity-led finance. He also emphasizes the benefits of private credit for both lenders and borrowers, including stronger bank balance sheets, enhanced access to capital, and better spreads for investors. 

When asked about the role of insurance companies in private credit, Dellaert notes that Blackstone has chosen to work with multiple insurance companies rather than owning an insurance company itself. This open architecture approach aligns with Blackstone's asset management DNA and allows them to serve a diverse range of clients. 

Regarding risk-adjusted returns, Dellaert acknowledges the premium earned in private credit due to the work involved and illiquidity. However, he emphasizes that the notion of liquidity is evolving, and investors with long-duration liabilities are reevaluating their need for liquid assets. 

Dellaert also addresses concerns about a potential bubble in private credit, arguing that overall leverage levels are lower than before the financial crisis and that default rates in Blackstone's non-investment-grade book are significantly lower than in public markets. 

Finally, when considering the impact of higher interest rates, Dellaert believes that the path of rates is less influential on their business than the structural shifts in financing markets.
