# 抵御洪灾四十年：泰晤士河屏障即将升级

---

随着全球**气候变化**带来海平面上升和风暴频繁猛烈的双重威胁，伦敦这座城市的主要防洪系统——**泰晤士河屏障**的抗灾能力正面临质疑。该屏障建于20世纪80年代，设计寿命为50年，一直成功守护着伦敦市。但专家警告，由于天气模式变化导致闸门关闭频率增加，将加快**泰晤士河屏障**的**老化**。负责管理该屏障的**环境署 (EA)** 正考虑加高屏障、新建屏障或在下游建造新结构等选项，计划在 **2040** 年之前做出决定。与此同时，环境署正努力在 **2040** 和 **2050** 年之前提高泰晤士河沿线和伦敦市中心的**防洪墙**高度。泰晤士河屏障的成功让伦敦人产生了一定的侥幸心理，但专家警告，伦敦易受洪水侵袭的脆弱性依然存在，需要对新基础设施进行重大投资，以确保伦敦在 **2050** 年之后仍能得到保护。政府最近宣布增加对防洪设施的投入，但由于成本上升，预计受到保护的房产数量将减少。

# Holding back the floods for 40 years: Thames Barrier is due an upgrade

---

As **London** faces the dual threats of **rising sea levels** and **more frequent and intense storms** due to **climate change**, the resilience of the **Thames Barrier**, the city's primary flood defense system, is being questioned. The barrier, designed in the 1980s with a 50-year lifespan, has been a successful protector of the city, but experts warn that **increased gate closures** due to changing weather patterns will accelerate its **degradation**. The **Environment Agency (EA)**, which operates the barrier, is considering options to bolster flood protection, including raising the barrier's height, building a new barrier, or constructing a new structure downstream, with a decision planned by **2040**. In the interim, the EA is working to raise the height of **flood walls** along the Thames by **2040** and **2050** for those in central London. The success of the Thames Barrier has led to a sense of complacency among Londoners, but experts warn that the city's vulnerability to flooding persists, and significant investments in new infrastructure are needed to ensure the city's protection beyond **2050**. The government has recently announced increased spending on flood defenses, but the number of properties expected to be protected has been reduced due to cost increases.
