# 爱尔兰推动欧洲央行增加员工引发了关于国籍配额的辩论

**欧洲中央银行工作人员委员会提议在招聘中引入** **国籍配额** **，以回应爱尔兰执行董事会成员** **菲利普·莱恩** **的言论。莱恩是欧洲央行首席经济学家，他警告爱尔兰政府，由于申请率低和即将到来的退休潮（包括他自己），爱尔兰在欧洲央行的代表性可能下降。工作人员委员会对莱恩专注于维持爱尔兰在欧洲央行的“**超大规模存在**”表示关切，认为这与加入银行时应**摒弃国家利益**的原则相矛盾。他们提议监控和提高招聘与晋升过程中国籍因素透明度，并建议实施阈值系统以确保**各国员工比例平衡**。然而，欧洲央行预计将拒绝这一提议，坚持其基于**绩效**的招聘立场。随着欧洲央行在未来十年面临一波退休潮，这一问题引起了关注，也为解决某些国家员工比例过高提供了机会，其中包括德国人，他们占据了近**四分之一的欧洲央行员工职位**；以及爱尔兰人，他们占员工总数的3.3%，远高于其在欧洲央行资本中所占的份额。爱尔兰部长尼尔·里奇蒙德支持莱恩推动提高爱尔兰代表性的努力，他指出爱尔兰在欧洲各机构中独特的地位。欧洲央行肯定了莱恩对多样化申请者的鼓励，并强调了其现有的**多元化和包容政策**。

# Ireland's Push for More ECB Staff Triggers Debate on Nationality Quotas

**The European Central Bank's staff committee has proposed the introduction of** **nationality quotas** **for recruitment, in response to comments made by Irish executive board member** **Philip Lane**. Lane, the ECB's chief economist, warned the Irish government of a potential decline in Irish representation at the bank due to low application rates and upcoming retirements, including his own. The staff committee expressed concern over Lane's focus on maintaining Ireland's "outsized presence" at the ECB, suggesting that it contradicted the principle of putting **national interests aside** when joining the bank. They proposed monitoring and increasing the transparency of the role of nationality in hiring and promotions, and suggested implementing a system of thresholds to ensure a **balanced representation** of nationalities. However, the ECB is expected to reject the proposal, maintaining its stance on hiring based on **merit**. The issue has gained attention as the ECB faces a significant wave of retirements in the next decade, providing an opportunity to address the over-representation of certain nationalities, including Germany, which holds nearly a **quarter of ECB staff positions**, and Ireland, with 3.3% of total staff, well above its share of ECB capital. Irish minister Neale Richmond supports Lane's push for more Irish representation, citing the unique position of Ireland in European institutions. The ECB affirmed Lane's encouragement of diverse applicants, highlighting its existing **diversity and inclusion policies**.
