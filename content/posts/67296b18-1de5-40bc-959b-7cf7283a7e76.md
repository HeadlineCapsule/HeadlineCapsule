快速检测针对抗生素耐药性“超级细菌”

# 瑞典公司开发的新冠快速检测获800万英镑朗格马克奖

**新闻摘要：** 瑞典公司 Sysmex Astrego 开发的快速测试已赢得旨在抗击抗生素耐药性“超级细菌”的 800 万英镑朗格马克奖。这些诊断测试可以在一小时内识别出尿路感染，将分析时间从两到三天显著缩短。这一创新对于应对抗微生物耐药性（AMR）至关重要，AMR 对现代医学构成日益严重的威胁，并导致 2019 年全球近 500 万人死亡。

**要点：**
- Sysmex Astrego 的快速诊断测试可以在一小时内检测出尿路感染，将分析时间从两到三天缩短。
- 该公司因其创新技术而获得 800 万英镑的朗格马克奖，旨在抗击抗生素耐药性“超级细菌”。
- 抗微生物耐药性（AMR）是一个不断加剧的威胁，导致 2019 年全球近 500 万人死亡。
- 这些快速测试利用了瑞典乌普萨拉大学的技术，目前在欧洲市场上销售，并可能被英国监管机构采用，用于国家医疗服务。
- Sysmex Astrego 旨在在全球范围内推广这项技术，通过增加产品销售降低成本。

**其他信息：**
- 另一个朗格马克奖竞争者是 Llusern Scientific，该公司专注于确认导致尿路感染的常见病原体的存在。该公司已与印度制造商讨论许可生产事宜。
- 朗格马克奖由英国创新署和英国基金会 Nesta 资助，后者在卫生、气候和教育等各个领域开展工作。印度生物技术产业研究援助委员会以及葛兰素史克（英国）和默克公司（美国）等制药公司也提供了额外支持。

 **Article Summary:** Rapid tests developed by Sysmex Astrego, a Swedish company, have won the £8mn Longitude Prize aimed at combating antibiotic-resistant "superbugs." These diagnostic tests can identify urinary tract infections within an hour, significantly reducing analysis time from two or three days. The innovation is crucial for tackling Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), which poses a growing threat to modern medicine and contributed to nearly 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019.

**Key Points:**
- Sysmex Astrego's rapid diagnostic tests can detect urinary tract infections within an hour, reducing analysis time from two or three days.
- The £8mn Longitude Prize was awarded to the company for their innovation aimed at combating antibiotic-resistant "superbugs."
- Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a growing threat that contributed to nearly 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019.
- The rapid tests utilize technology from Sweden's Uppsala University and are currently on the market in Europe, with potential adoption by UK regulators for use within the National Health Service.
- Sysmex Astrego aims to roll out this technology globally, reducing costs through increased sales of their product.

**Additional Information:**
- Another Longitude Prize contender is Llusern Scientific, which focuses on confirming the presence of common pathogens causing urinary tract infections. The company has been discussing licensing production with Indian manufacturers.
- The Longitude Prize is funded by Innovate UK and Nesta, a British foundation working in various sectors such as health, climate, and education. Additional support comes from India's Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council and pharmaceutical companies like GSK (UK) and Merck & Co (US).
