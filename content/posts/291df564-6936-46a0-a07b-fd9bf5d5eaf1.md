# *\*Calpers** 因 “鲁莽” 诉讼对埃克森董事会和 CEO投反对票 

---

美国最大的公共养老基金 \*Calpers 宣布，决定对埃克森美孚（ExxonMobil）整个董事会的重新选举及其首席执行官投反对票。此举是对这家石油巨头旨在压制股东声音的争议性法律行动的强烈抗议。该基金规模达4630亿美元，其领导人发表了一份强有力的声明，强调由于埃克森美孚起诉两个关注气候问题的投资团体，几十年的 **股东权利** 受到威胁。Calpers的高管 Marcy Frost 和 Theresa Taylor 警告说，这起诉讼可能会对股东对公司的影响力产生 "毁灭性后果"。因此，他们计划在2024年5月29日对所有12名董事会成员和CEO投反对票。埃克森美孚最初于今年一月起诉荷兰 Follow This组织和美国顾问Arjuna Capital ，理由是这两个机构提出了一项决议，要求采取更积极的措施来减少温室气体排放；即使该提案被撤回，**埃克森** 仍然坚持其诉讼。这家石油巨头的立场受到投资者的广泛批评，其中包括规模达2600亿美元的纽约州公共退休基金（New York State Common Retirement Fund），它也打算对大多数埃克森美孚的董事投反对票，因为他们没有做好过渡准备并忽视了股东权利。Calpers 持有约10亿美元的埃克森股份，正敦促其他股东加入他们的行列，发出明确信息以保护股东民主制度。

# **Calpers** to Vote Against **Exxon Board and CEO Over ‘Reckless’ Lawsuit** 

---

In a significant development, the largest public pension plan in the US, Calpers, has announced its decision to vote against the re-election of the entire ExxonMobil board of directors and its chief executive. This move serves as a strong protest against the oil major's contentious legal action aimed at silencing shareholder voices. The $463 billion fund's leaders issued a powerful statement, emphasizing that decades of **shareholder rights** are under threat due to Exxon's lawsuit against two climate-focused investor groups. Marcie Frost and Theresa Taylor, Calpers' top executives, warned of the potentially "devastating repercussions" of this legal action on shareholder influence over companies. As a result, they plan to vote against all 12 board members and the CEO on May 29, 2024. Exxon initially sued Dutch group Follow This and US adviser Arjuna Capital in January for presenting a resolution demanding more aggressive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; however, even after withdrawing this proposal, **Exxon** has persisted with its lawsuit. The oil giant's stance has drawn widespread criticism from investors, including the $260 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, which also intends to vote against most of Exxon's directors due to their inadequate transition readiness and disregard for shareholders' rights. Calpers, holding about $1 billion in Exxon shares, is urging fellow shareholders to join them in sending a clear message to protect shareholder democracy.
