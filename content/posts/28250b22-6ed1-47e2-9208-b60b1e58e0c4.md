金融监管的毒素政治化

## 摘要：
文章讨论了金融监管如何变得越来越政治化，党派之间的意识形态分歧影响着全球银行、保险公司和资产管理公司的规则手册。近年来，这种趋势在英国和美国选举中都很明显，候选人讨论了复杂的议题，例如《索尔维尼二保险监管》和中央银行的政策。

文章举例说明了政治干预金融政策制定的一些案例，包括Randy Quarles在特朗普总统任期内的去监管努力和英国Jeremy Hunt公开批评金融行为监管局的政策倡议。联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）目前就银行资本金要求进行的斗争也得到了讨论，Marty Gruenberg的辞职可能会影响结果。

 ## 有趣的问题：
 1. 问题：政治两极分化近年来如何影响了金融监管？
     答案：政治两极分化导致党派在银行资本金要求和中央银行政策等关键监管问题上出现意识形态分歧，从而导致金融监管的政治化程度加深。这种趋势在英国和美国选举中都很明显，候选人讨论了复杂的议题，例如《索尔维尼二保险监管》和特朗普总统任期内的去监管努力。

 2. 问题：政治干预金融政策制定的例子有哪些？
     答案：例子包括Randy Quarles在联邦储备委员会进行的去监管努力、唐纳德·特朗普试图通过威胁移除主席杰伊·鲍威尔并要求积极的利率下调来影响美联储，以及英国Jeremy Hunt公开批评金融行为监管局的政策倡议。

 3. 问题：Marty Gruenberg从FDIC辞职可能会如何影响银行资本金要求？
     答案：在Gruenberg任职期间，FDIC董事会由民主党人占多数，可以根据《巴塞尔协议III》最终版本推动更严格的银行资本金要求。他的离职可能会破坏这些规则，并进一步损害乔·拜登的连任希望，因为如果共和党任命他们反对的副主席，这可能会发生。

## Summary:
The article discusses how financial regulations have become increasingly politicized, with ideological splits between parties influencing the rule books governing banks, insurers, and asset managers globally. In recent years, this trend has been evident in both the UK and US elections, where candidates discussed complex topics such as Solvencu II insurance regulations and central banking policies.

The article highlights examples of political interference in financial policymaking, including Randy Quarles' deregulation efforts during Trump's presidency and Jeremy Hunt's public rebuke of the Financial Conduct Authority's policy initiative in the UK. The ongoing fight over bank capital requirements at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is also discussed, with Marty Gruenberg's resignation potentially impacting the outcome.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How has political polarization affected financial regulation in recent years? 
A: Political polarization has led to ideological splits between parties on key regulatory issues such as bank capital requirements and central banking policies, resulting in increased politicization of financial regulations. This trend is evident in both the UK and US elections, where candidates have discussed complex topics like Solvencu II insurance regulations and deregulation efforts during Trump's presidency.

2. Q: What are some examples of political interference in financial policymaking? 
A: Examples include Randy Quarles' deregulation efforts at the Federal Reserve, Donald Trump's attempts to influence the Fed by threatening to remove chair Jay Powell and demanding aggressive rate cuts, and Jeremy Hunt'n public rebuke of the Financial Conduct Authority's policy initiative in the UK.

3. Q: How might Marty Gruenberg's resignation from the FDIC impact bank capital requirements? 
A: With Gruenberg in place, the FDIC board has a Democrat majority to push through tougher bank capital requirements under Basel III Endgame. His departure could potentially scupper these rules and further damage Joe Biden's re-election hopes if Republicans install their preferred vice-chair who opposes them.
