纽约银行重新品牌定位，与逐渐消退的华尔街时代脱钩

**纽约银行重新品牌化：放弃“梅隆”品牌**

纽约银行是一家历史悠久、成立于 1784 年的金融机构，已决定通过从其名称中删除“梅隆”来进行重新品牌化。该银行将仅以 BNY（纽约银行）的名称运营。这一变化反映了华尔街不断变化的格局，也遵循了库恩洛布（Kuhn Loeb）和莱曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers）等黄金时代品牌逐渐消失的步伐。

**历史背景：梅隆在华尔街的崛起**
梅隆成立于 1869 年，当时美国正处于大规模工业扩张的时期。它成为金融领域的知名品牌，安德鲁·梅隆 (Andrew Mellon) 在大萧条之前曾担任美国财政部长。在黄金时代，包括约翰·皮埃尔庞特·摩根（John Pierpont Morgan）和萨缪尔·萨克斯（Samuel Sachs）在内的多个有影响力的家族在华尔街建立了他们的名字。

**黄金时代品牌的衰落：金融品牌的变迁**
联邦储备系统的前任官方历史学家加里·理查森（Gary Richardson）指出，自 20 世纪 60 年代以来，黄金时代的品牌一直在消失。虽然像沃堡（Warburg）和高盛（Goldman Sachs）这样的家族名字今天仍在华尔街占据重要地位，但其他品牌，如库恩洛布（Kuhn Loeb）和莱曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers），已经从公众视野中消失或与其他机构合并。

**BNY 的重新品牌化战略：提高知名度和现代化形象**
纽约梅隆银行公司计划在匹兹堡保留“梅隆”名称，因为它通过卡内基梅隆大学、梅隆广场和梅隆公园，仍然是当地历史的重要组成部分。然而，BNY 的重新品牌化努力旨在提高其身份在全球舞台上的知名度并现代化其形象。该银行监督着托管、市场和财富服务业务近 50 万亿美元的资产。

**结论：BNY 的新时代**
纽约银行决定从其品牌中删除“梅隆”，反映了华尔街金融机构适应不断变化的市场动态和客户反馈而调整名称和形象的更广泛趋势。通过简化 BNY 品牌，该银行寻求提高认可度，同时保持其独特的身份。

 **Bank of New York Rebrands: Dropping 'Mellon' from Brand**

The Bank of New York, a prominent financial institution with roots dating back to 1784, has decided to rebrand by removing "Mellon" from its name. The bank will now operate solecuously as BNY (Bank of New York). This change reflects the evolving landscape of Wall Street and follows in the footsteps of other Gilded Age names that have faded over time, such as Kuhn Loeb and Lehman Brothers.

**Historical Background: The Rise of Mellon on Wall Street**
Mellon was founded in 1869 during a period marked by massive expansion due to US industrialization. It became one of the prominent brands in finance, with Andrew Mellon serving as the US Treasury secretary before the Great Depression. The Gilded Age saw several influential families establishing their names on Wall Street, including John Pierpont Morgan and Samuel Sachs.

**The Decline of Gilded Age Names: A Shift in Financial Branding**
Gary Richardson, former official historian of the Federal Reserve system, noted that Gilded Age names have been fading since the 1960s. While some family names like Warburg and Goldman Sachs remain prominent on Wall Street today, others such as Kuhn Loeb and Lehman Brothers have disappeared from public consciousness or merged with other institutions.

**BNY's Rebranding Strategy: Improving Familiarity and Modernizing Image**
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation plans to retain the "Mellon" name in Pittsburgh, where it remains a significant part of local history through Carnegie Mellon University, Mellon Square, and Mellon Park. However, BNY's rebranding effort is aimed at improving familiarity with its identity and modernizing its image on the global stage. The bank oversees nearly $50tn in assets across custody, markets, and wealth services businesses.

**Conclusion: A New Era for BNY**
The Bank of New York's decision to drop "Mellon" from its brand reflects a broader trend on Wall Street where financial institutions are adapting their names and images in response to changing market dynamics and client feedback. By streamlining the BNY brand, the bank seeks to enhance recognition while maintain.
