# 突破性疗法改善瘫痪患者的运动功能 

**一项具有里程碑意义的临床试验显示，严重** **瘫痪**患者在手臂功能方面取得了显著进步。该试验采用了名为 Arc-EX 的非侵入性脊髓刺激装置，通过放置在皮肤上的电极将电流输送到受伤部位。 

由华盛顿大学的切特·莫里茨教授领导的研究，在欧洲和北美招募了 65 名受试者，结果令人瞩目——72% 在两个月后力量和功能均有实质性提升，90% 的受试者在至少一项衡量标准上有改善。这些成果为**脊髓损伤 (SCI)**患者带来了新的希望。 

Arc-EX 试验的成功之处在于能够刺激伤口周围剩余神经再生。这种非侵入性的方法比植入装置更安全、更易获取，并且在电气刺激疗程结束后仍能产生持久效果。苏格兰的一位四肢瘫痪记者梅拉妮·里德 (Melanie Reid)证明了此设备对其动作能力的影响。 

正在推广这项技术的公司 Onward Medical 目前正寻求在美国和欧洲获得 Arc-EX 的监管批准。同时，研究人员希望将该装置的使用范围扩大到脊髓损伤以外的领域，例如中风，并继续其在 **脑** 和脊髓植入物方面的工作。Harvey Sihota（来自英国医疗慈善机构 Spinal Research）强调，这一突破性进展为 SCI 患者带来了新的希望和独立生活的能力。

# Breakthrough Therapy Improves Movement in Paralysed Patients 

**A groundbreaking clinical trial has revealed significant improvements** in hand and arm function for individuals with severe **paralysis**. The trial involved the use of a **non-invasive spinal cord stimulation device**, Arc-EX, which delivers electrical currents to the injured area via electrodes placed on the skin. 

The study, led by Professor Chet Moritz from the University of Washington, included 65 participants across Europe and North America, with remarkable results—72% experienced substantial gains in both strength and function after two months, while 90% showed improvement in at least one measure. These outcomes provide new optimism for those living with **spinal cord injuries (SCI)**. 

The success of the Arc-EX trial is attributed to its ability to stimulate regrowth in residual nerves around the injury site. This non-invasive approach offers a safer, more accessible alternative to implanted devices and has shown lasting effects even after the electrical stimulus course ended. Melanie Reid, a tetraplegic journalist from Scotland, testified to the device's impact on her movement. 

Onward Medical, a company commercializing this technology, is currently seeking regulatory approval in the US and Europe for Arc-EX. Meanwhile, researchers aim to expand its use beyond spinal injuries to other conditions like strokes while also continuing their work with **brain** and **spinal cord implants**. This breakthrough offers renewed hope and independence to those living with SCI, as highlighted by Harvey Sihota of Spinal Research, a UK medical charity.
