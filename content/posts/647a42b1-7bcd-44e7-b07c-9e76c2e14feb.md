在通货膨胀持续的背景下，降价无法吸引欧洲消费者

# 文章摘要：
尽管欧洲公司加大促销力度，希望吸引受通货膨胀影响的消费者，但欧洲的消费需求仍然疲软。由于消费者抑制支出并寻求最佳交易，折扣策略的效果没有像预期那样好，导致贸易效率下降。

## 要点：

1. **折扣策略无效**：为了在生活成本危机期间推动销售，欧洲公司将快速消费品（FMCG）的促销强度提高了15%，但这并没有显著增加销售量。

2. **消费者行为**：消费者继续抑制支出并寻找更好的交易，导致贸易效率下降，因为价格削减对增加销售的效果不彰。

3. **通货膨胀压力**：自202n年达到峰值以来，通货膨胀率已显著下降，但仍然高于新冠疫情前的水平。食品和超市商品的价格仍比2021年高出30%，这迫使公司寻求除了涨价之外的其他收入来源。

4. **对品牌产品的影响**：在生活成本危机期间，品牌产品制造商的市场份额损失给更实惠的自有品牌商品，零售商也削减了白标产品的价格，但并没有像品牌食品制造商那样激烈或有效。

5. **警告过度折扣**：研究公司Circana警告说，过度降价可能会鼓励消费者只在有优惠时才购买该品牌，导致公司的利润率和利润下降。

 **Article Summary:**
European consumer demand remains muted despite an increase in promotional intensity by companies across Europe to entice inflation-squeezed shoppers. The discounting strategy has not been as effective as planned due to consumers holding back spending and seeking the best deals, resulting in a decline of trade efficiency.

**Key Points:**
1. **Discounting Strategy Ineffective:** Companies across Europe have increased promotional intensity by 15% for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) to drive sales during the cost of living crisis, but this has not resulted in a significant boost in sales volumes.
2. **Consumer Behavior:** Consumers continue to hold back spending and shop around for better deals, leading to a decline in trade efficiency as price cuts are less effective at increasing sales.
3. **Inflationary Pressures:** Inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in 202n but remains above pre-Covid levels, with food and supermarket goods prices still 30% higher than they were in 2021. This forces companies to seek alternative revenue sources beyond price increases.
4. **Impact on Branded Products:** Manufacturers of branded products have experienced a loss of market share to more affordable own-brand goods during the cost of living crisis, with retailers also slashing prices on white label products but not as intensely or effectively as branded foodmakers.
5. **Warning Against Excessive Discounts:** Research firm Circana warns that excessive price cuts could encourage shoppers to only buy a brand when there is a deal, leading to reduced margins and profits for companies.
