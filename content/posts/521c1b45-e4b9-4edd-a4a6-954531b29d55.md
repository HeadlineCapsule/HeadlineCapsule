# 阿斯通开始修复其财务列车残骸 

法国高速列车制造公司阿斯通（Alstom）宣布了一项财务重组计划，提高了投资者信心，推动了其股价上涨。该公司计划通过**配股**、主要股东和银行的支持、**资产处置**和**混合债券**筹集10亿欧元。此前，由于英国继承合同的问题，该公司经历了艰难时期，其**净债务**达到不可持续的30亿欧元。这项计划的成功执行将大幅减少债务，并使阿斯通能够在复杂行业中发展。随着规模和财务状况的改善，预计阿斯通将获得更有利的合同，目标是今年实现12亿欧元的**息税折旧摊销前利润**，尽管投资者将在完全接受扭亏为盈的故事之前，密切关注现金流是否稳定。 

阿斯通的财务困境吸引了**空头卖家**，因为该公司在遭受10亿欧元现金损失后，其**投资级评级**面临风险。该损失部分归因于从庞巴迪收购过程中继承的问题英国合同。通过财务重组计划，阿斯通的目标是将净债务减少到10亿欧元，并在未来三年内产生15亿欧元的自由现金流，使**资产负债表**恢复到健康状态。尽管随着绿色旅行需求的增加，预计铁路行业将增长，但阿斯通面临强大的客户、薄利和不可预测的订单时间等挑战。然而，随着原有合同即将结束，阿斯通有望签署更有利可图的交易，这可能使其当前股价大幅上涨。

# Alstom starts to repair its financial train wreck 

Alstom, the French maker of TGV trains, has announced a financial restructuring plan that has boosted investor confidence and sent its stock price rising. The company aims to raise €1bn through a **rights issue**, supported by major shareholders and banks, as well as through **disposals** and a **hybrid bond**. This comes after a challenging period that saw Alstom's **net debt** reach an unsustainable €3bn, largely due to issues with inherited UK contracts. The successful execution of the plan will significantly reduce debt and position Alstom for growth in a complex industry. With scale and improved financial health, Alstom is expected to secure more favorable contracts and target an **EBIT** of €1.2bn this year, although investors will be watching for evidence of stable **cash flow** before fully embracing the turnaround story. 

/n/n

Alstom's financial woes had attracted **short sellers**, as the company's **investment-grade rating** was at risk following a €1bn cash loss. The loss was partly due to problematic UK contracts inherited from the acquisition of Bombardier. With its financial restructuring plan, Alstom aims to reduce its net debt to €1bn and generate €1.5bn in free cash flow over the next three years, bringing its **balance sheet** back to a healthy state. While the rail industry is expected to grow with increasing demand for greener travel options, Alstom faces challenges in the form of powerful customers, tight margins, and unpredictable order timing. However, with its legacy contracts running their course, Alstom is poised to sign more profitable deals, potentially driving significant upside to its current share price.
