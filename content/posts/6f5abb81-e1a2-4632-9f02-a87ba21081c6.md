# 交易员押注英镑贬值，预计英国央行将在夏季前降息

**段落 1** 

投资者对英镑的看空押注日益增加，预计 **英格兰银行（BoE）**将在夏季之前开始降息，这一预期早于 **联邦储备委员会（Fed）**。这种情绪转变反映在 **美国商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）**的数据中，该数据显示，货币投机者对英镑的看空押注升至16个月以来的最高水平。 一家著名的托管银行 **州街银行** 也报告称，资产管理者对英镑越来越持熊市态度。这种立场转变的主要驱动因素是 **疲软的经济数据** 和 **英国通胀下降**，导致英镑兑美元汇率在2023年贬值1.5%。

**段落 2** 

**美国和英国的通货膨胀率** 对比明显，美国3月份通胀率达到3.5%，超出预期，而英国通胀率则下降到3.2%，未达到预期。这影响了市场预期，交易员现在预计英国央行将在年底前至少两次降息 **0.25个百分点**，而联邦基金期货价格显示联邦储备委员会仅会降息一次或两次。 **州街银行的 Michael Metcalfe** 将这种转变归因于对央行步调一致的假设所面临的挑战。到7月联邦储备委员会降息的可能性已经降低，而英国央行在6月前降息的可能性接近50%。

**段落 3** 

专家的评论进一步强调了市场的这一展望。**Vanguard 的 Roger Hallam** 指出，由于通胀率仍低于目标，联邦储备委员会不太可能降低利率。相反，**NatWest 的 Imogen Bachra** 预测英国央行今年会更激进地降息 **1个百分点**，她引用了英国国内数据作为预测依据。对冲基金和杠杆基金也表现出类似的趋势，根据 CFTC 的数据，它们增加了英镑的净空头头寸。 **州街银行对资产管理者英镑持仓的分析** 与这一趋势一致，表明从买入转向卖出。 **花旗银行的数据** 也证实了这一点，显示资产管理者在过去20个交易日中有15天净卖出英镑。

**段落 4** 

对英镑的看空押注，加上美债价格下跌对英国债券的影响，导致10年期美国国债和英国国债收益率上升。尽管英国央行预计将在周四维持5.25%的利率水平，但分析师仍预计该行将表现出鸽派的前景展望。英国央行2月份的通胀预测显示，通胀将在两年半内回到目标水平，这与投资者对2024年多次降息的预期存在分歧。 **T Rowe Price 的 Tomasz Wieladek** 表示，任何低于目标的通胀迹象都可能促使投资者预计会进一步降息。

# Traders Bet Against Sterling in Belief BoE Will Cut Rates by Summer

**Paragraph 1** 

Investors are increasingly betting against the pound, anticipating that the **Bank of England (BoE)** will begin lowering interest rates as soon as summer, outpacing the expected timeline for the **Federal Reserve**. This shift in sentiment is reflected in data from the **US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)**, which indicates that currency speculators' wagers against sterling have climbed to a 16-month peak. **State Street**, a prominent custodian bank, also reports that asset managers are demonstrating increased bearishness towards the UK currency. The primary drivers of this change in positioning are **weak economic data** and declining **UK inflation**, which have contributed to a 1.5% drop in the pound's value against the dollar in 2023.

/n/n**Paragraph 2** 

The contrast between **US and UK inflation rates** is notable, with US inflation surpassing expectations at 3.5% in March, while UK inflation dipped to 3.2%, falling short of forecasts. This has influenced market expectations, with traders now anticipating at least two **quarter-point rate cuts** from the BoE by year-end, compared to one or two cuts priced in for the Fed. **Michael Metcalfe of State Street** attributes this shift to the challenge posed to the assumption that central banks would move in tandem. The likelihood of a Fed rate cut by July has diminished, while the probability of a BoE cut by June is nearing 50%. 

/n/n**Paragraph 3** 

The market's outlook is further emphasized by comments from experts. **Roger Hallam of Vanguard** notes that the Fed is unlikely to ease rates due to inflation remaining below their target. Conversely, **Imogen Bachra of NatWest** predicts a more aggressive cut of 1 percentage point in BoE rates this year, citing the domestic data backdrop. These sentiments are reflected in the actions of hedge funds and leveraged funds, who have increased their net short positions on sterling, according to CFTC data. **State Street's analysis** of asset managers' sterling holdings aligns with this trend, indicating a shift from buying to selling. **Citi's data** corroborates this, showing net selling by asset managers in 15 of the past 20 trading days. 

/n/n**Paragraph 4** 

The bets against sterling coincide with the impact of falling US bond prices on gilts, resulting in rising yields for both 10-year Treasuries and gilts. Analysts anticipate a dovish outlook from the BoE in their guidance on Thursday, despite expectations that rates will be maintained at 5.25%. The BoE's February inflation forecast, which predicted a return to target in two and a half years, diverged from investors' pricing in of multiple cuts for 2024. This discrepancy sets the stage for potential adjustments in investor expectations, with **Tomasz Wieladek of T Rowe Price** suggesting that any indication of below-target inflation could prompt investors to price in additional cuts.
