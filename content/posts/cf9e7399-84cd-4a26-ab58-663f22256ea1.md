标致雪铁龙将部分中国电动汽车生产转移到欧洲

**Stellantis 将中国电动汽车生产转移到欧洲** 

为了应对布鲁塞尔宣布对中国制造的电动汽车 (EV) 征收额外关税的计划，Stellantis 决定将一些中国品牌的电动汽车生产转移到欧洲。这家拥有雪铁龙和菲亚特品牌的公司计划从今年9月开始，在其欧洲经销商处销售中国汽车制造商 Leapmotor 的电动汽车。

Stellantis 首席执行官卡洛斯·塔瓦雷斯确认，这些汽车中的一部分将在欧洲的 Stellantis 工厂生产。他表示，计划的关税是要“纠正”欧洲汽车制造商与他们的中国同行相比缺乏竞争力的问题，并且他们之前已经同意了进口水平，在这一水平上，对他们来说，本地生产没有意义。

这一宣布是在中国最大的电动汽车制造商比亚迪收到 17.4% 的较低关税增幅后做出的，比亚迪计划明年开始在匈牙利生产汽车。另一家中国汽车制造商奇瑞也致力于从 2029 年开始在巴塞罗那的一家工厂每年生产 15 万辆汽车。

关税提案突出了欧洲汽车工业中德国和法意集团之间的分歧。德国汽车制造商严重依赖中国市场，而法国和意大利公司则更多地依赖欧洲市场。后者长期以来一直警告说，廉价的中国车型将在欧洲超越他们的竞争对手。

总之，Stellantis 决定将部分中国电动汽车生产转移到欧洲，是直接回应了布鲁塞尔对中国制造电动汽车的额外关税计划。这一举措可能为欧洲汽车制造商提供短期缓解，但可能会导致中国公司增加长期投资，从而导致类似于今天在中国出现的价格压力。

 **Stellantis Shifts Chinese EV Production to Europe**  

In response to Brussels' announcement of planned additional tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, Stellantis has decided to shift the production of some Chinese-branded EVs to Europe. The company, which owns Citroën and Fiat brands, plans to sell EVs from Chinese carmaker Leapmotor at its European dealerships starting September.

Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares confirmed that a portion of these cars would be produced in Stellantis plants within Europe itself. He stated that the planned tariffs were "correcting a lack of competitiveness" among European carmakers compared to their Chinese counterparts, and that they had previously agreed on import levels at which it made sense for them not to produce locally.

The announcement comes after BYD, China's largest EV maker, received a lower tariff increase of amoeba17.4% and plans to start producing cars in Hungary next year. Another Chinese carmaker, Chery, is aiming to make 150,000 cars per year from 2029 onwards at a plant in Barcelona.

The tariff proposals have highlighted the divide within the European automotive industry between German and French/Italian groups. While German carmakers rely heavily on the Chinese market, French and Italian companies depend more on the European market. The latter group has long warned that cheaper Chinese models would outprice their rivals in Europe.

In summary, Stellantis's decision to shift some of its Chinese EV production to Europe is a direct response to Brussels' planned additional tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. This move may provide short-term relief for European carmakers but could lead to increased investments by Chinese companies in the long run, potentially resulting in price pressures similar to those seen in China today.
