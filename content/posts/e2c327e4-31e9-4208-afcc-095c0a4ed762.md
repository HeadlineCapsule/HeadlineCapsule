美国预计将取消对向沙特阿拉伯出售进攻性武器的禁令。

美国预计将在未来几周内解除对**沙特阿拉伯**出售进攻性武器的禁令，这是华盛顿和利雅得关系改善的一部分。这一决定是在2022年联合国促成的停火之后做出的，该停火大体上得到了遵守，沙特阿拉伯正在试图摆脱也门内战。解除禁令将是加强双边关系的另一个迹象，因为两国在能源和中东政策等关键问题上开展合作并达成双边协议。

问题1：有哪些因素促进了美国和沙特阿拉伯关系的改善？
答案1：关系改善可以归因于多个因素，包括自2022年以来大体上得到遵守的、由联合国促成的也门停火。此外，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵加强了华盛顿对在能源和中东政策等关键问题上需要沙特阿拉伯合作的认识。两国还在努力最终确定一系列双边协议，包括防务协议和美国与王国民用核计划之间的合作。

问题2：解除进攻性武器销售禁令可能会对中东地区的区域动态产生什么影响？
答案2：解除禁令可能对中东地区的区域动态产生重大影响。它可能会加强沙特阿拉伯作为美国关键合作伙伴的地位，并可能影响其对也门内战等冲突的做法，自2015年以来，沙特阿拉伯一直参与其中。此外，这一举措可能会影响与其他地区行为者如伊朗的关系，伊朗支持也门的胡塞叛军。

问题3：关于解除对沙特阿拉伯进攻性武器销售禁令，有哪些潜在的担忧或批评？
答案3：批评者可能会对人权问题和涉及沙特阿拉伯的过去争议提出关切，例如2018年记者贾马尔·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）的谋杀。人们也可能担心美国制造的武器可能被用于也门内战等冲突。
