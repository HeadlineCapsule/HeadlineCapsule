CRE非危机持续蔓延

美国银行持有的商业房地产贷款（CRE）的各个方面、美国股票的估值倍数以及解释这些现象的理论。它还涉及了由于基于技术的商业模式而导致的经济变化的潜在影响。作者提出了 MSCI 抵押债务智能和 S&P Global Market Intelligence 关于问题 CRE 贷款和 S&P 500 的每股收益（ROE）的数据。

文本建议，尽管有大量的问题 CRE 贷款，但整体银行体系可以处理损失，因为储备充足。作者还质疑“新经济”理论在 ROE 和投资资本回报率（ROIC）数据基础上的经验证据是否真实。

文本最后提到了一些替代指标，例如自由现金流占权益的百分比，这可能显示出支持“新经济”理论的上涨趋势。然而，它强调需要有说服力的证据来证明该理论更高的估值倍数。

文本还提供了有关金融市场和美国政治的消息通讯和播客。

The text discusses various aspects related to commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by U.S. banks, the valuation multiples of US stocks, and theories explaining these phenomena. It also touchs on potential impacts of economic changes due to technology-based business models. The author presents data from MSCI Mortgamo Debt Intelligence and S&P Global Market Intelligence regarding troubled CRE loans and return on equity (ROE) for the S&P 500, respectively.

The text suggests that despite a significant amount of troubled CRE loans, the overall banking system can handle the losses due to sufficient reserves. The author also questions whether the "new economy" theory explaining higher valuation multiples in US stocks is empirically true based on ROE and return on invested capital (ROIC) data.

The text concludes with a mention of alternative metrics, such as free cash flow as a percentage of equity, which may show an upward trend that supports the "new economy" theory. However, it emphasizes the need for compelling evidence to justify higher valuation multiples based on this theory.

The text also provides information about various newsletters and podcasts related to financial markets and U.S. politics.
