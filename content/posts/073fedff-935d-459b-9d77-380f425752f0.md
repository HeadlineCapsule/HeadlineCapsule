投资者对墨西哥谨慎以待，此前该国货币比索暴跌

**摘要：**
在墨西哥总统大选后，投资者对该国金融市场仍持谨慎态度，因为人们担心司法改革和潜在的借贷成本上升。尽管墨西哥政府努力稳定市场，包括任命了商业友好的经济部长马塞洛·埃布拉德（Marcelo Ebrard），但投资者信心尚未完全恢复。墨西哥比索在大选后大幅下跌，但在谢因鲍姆（Sheinbaum）宣布内阁名单后有所回升。然而，它仍比大选前要弱，而此前受益于墨西哥高利率的**套利交易**策略现在因与谢因鲍姆改革议程相关的增加波动性和风险而吸引力下降。

**要点：**

1. 尽管墨西哥官员试图安抚投资者，但**墨西哥比索**在总统大选后仍存在稳定性担忧。

2. 投资者信心受到新政府有争议的司法改革计划和潜在更高借贷成本的影响。

3. 任命商业友好的经济部长马塞洛·埃布拉德（Marcelo Ebrard）提供了一些缓解，但尚未完全恢复市场乐观情绪。

4. 此前受益于墨西哥高利率的**套利交易**策略现在因与谢因鲍姆改革议程相关的增加波动性和风险而吸引力下降。

5. 经济学家下调了2024年和2025年的GDP增长预测，同时提高了通货膨胀预期；预计比索明年将进一步走弱。

 **Summary:**  
Investors remain cautious about Mexico's financial markets following president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum's election, amid concerns over judicial reforms and potential higher borrowing costs. Despite efforts to stabilize the market, including appointing a business-friendly economy minister Marcelo Ebrard, investor confidence has not fully recovered. The Mexican peso fell sharply post-election but saw some gains after Sheinbaum's cabinet announcement. However, it remains weaker compared to pre-election levels and the carry trade strategy that previously benefited from Mexico's high interest rates is now less attractive due to increased volatility and risk associated with Sheinbaum's reform agenda.

**Key Points:**  
1. **Mexican peso** stability concerns persist after president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum'cuidado de la economía** election, despite efforts by Mexican officials to reassure investors.
2. Investor confidence is affected by controversial judicial reform plans and potential higher borrowing costs under the new administration.
3. The appointment of business-friendly economy minister Marcelo Ebrard has provided some relief but hasn't fully restored market optimism.
4. The carry trade strategy, which previously benefited from Mexico's high interest rates, is now less attractive due to increased volatility and risk associated with Sheinbaum's reform agenda.
5. Economists have downgraded GDP growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025 while raising inflation expectations; the peso is predicted to weaken further against the US dollar next year.
