# 哈维尔·米莱（Javier Milei）称西班牙首相夫人“腐败”引发外交争端

阿根廷**总统哈维尔·米莱**（Javier Milei）在访问马德里期间引发了一场外交争议。他**回避了与西班牙首相佩德罗·桑切斯（Pedro Sánchez）的会晤**，转而参加由**西班牙极右翼政党Vox**组织的**极右翼集会**。米莱在集会上**攻击了桑切斯的妻子**贝戈尼亚·戈麦斯（Begoña Gómez），称她为“**腐败**分子”。戈麦斯目前正身陷**腐败调查**。这一事件导致西班牙**召回驻阿根廷大使**。米莱以他的**自由意志主义观点**著称，他批评了“**癌变的社会主义**”，并赞扬了**自由市场资本主义**。随着欧洲准备迎来6月9日的选举，极右翼领导人，如**玛丽娜·勒庞**（Marine Le Pen）和**乔治亚·梅洛尼**（Giorgia Meloni）正寻求获得更多支持，米莱的此番言论也引起了关注。米莱的行为和言论导致阿根廷和西班牙之间关系紧张，此前还发生过西班牙部长指控米莱**吸毒**的事件。这篇新闻摘要还重点提到西班牙对阿根廷的**大量外国投资**，以及米莱更倾向于与**右翼人士**而不是左翼盟友会面的事实。
