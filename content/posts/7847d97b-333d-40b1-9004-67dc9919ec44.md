萨瓦德尔在BBVA收购战中吸引关键零售投资者

## 摘要：
在持续的**敌意收购战**中，BBVA 已向 Banco Sabadell 提出收购要约，但该要约被 Sabadell 的董事会拒绝。这笔交易的价值为 120 亿欧元，代表了多年来欧洲银行业的最大收购案。由于担心竞争、金融包容性和对加泰罗尼亚和巴伦西亚地区的区域影响，西班牙政府反对这项交易。

Sabadell 的董事长 Josep Oliu 向零售投资者（持有 45% 的股份）强调了 Sabadell 作为独立实体的前景。他声称 BBVA 的报价低估了该银行，并强调如果西班牙经济部在股东接受要约后阻止合并，将存在执行风险。

BBVA 在向股东推出要约之前，必须获得包括欧洲中央银行在内的各种监管机构的批准。如果大多数 Sabadell 投资者出售他们的股份，交易可以继续进行；然而，西班牙经济部将对拟议中的合并做出裁决，这可能要到 2026 年才能发生。在西班牙，敌意收购是罕见的，漫长的审批流程使交易面临着政治波动和潜在政府变化的风险。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 问题：哪些因素导致 BBVA 的收购被视为敌意收购，这如何影响了 Sabadell 的应对策略？
   答案："敌意收购"一词是指一家公司（BBVA）在没有目标公司管理层（Sabadell）的同意或合作的情况下进行收购尝试。在这种情况下，BBVA 提出了全股要约，被 Sabadell 的董事会拒绝。因此，他们直接向零售股东提供了相同的条款。这种方法迫使 Sabadell 进入防守模式，并迫使他们说服投资者该银行独立价值和潜在增长前景。

2. 问题：西班牙政府反对如何影响 BBVA 的收购要约，如果合并被阻止，对两家银行有何影响？
   答案：西班牙政府因担心竞争、金融包容性和对加泰罗尼亚和巴伦西亚地区的区域影响而反对这项交易。如果股东接受 BBVA 的要约，但西班牙经济部阻止合并，这将对两家银行产生重大不利影响。BBVA 将成为两个独立实体的大股东，却无法将其整合或实现成本节约。这种情况可能会负面影响股东价值，并使未来增长前景不确定。

3. 问题：西班牙敌意收购的漫长审批流程可能带来哪些风险，尤其是政治波动方面？
   答案：漫长的审批流程使交易面临各种风险，包括政府更迭和监管优先事项的转变。政治波动可能会导致合并延迟或取消，如果新政府反对，情况尤为如此。此外，西班牙经济部可能需要很长时间才能对拟议中的合并做出裁决，

## Summary:
In an ongoing **hostile takeover battle**, BBVA has made a bid for Banco Sabadell, which was rejected by Sabadell's board. The offer is valued at €12 billion and represents the largest European banking takeover in years. Spain's government opposes the deal due to concerns about competition, financial inclusion, and regional impact on Catalonia and Valencia.

Sabadell's chair, Josep Oliu, has reached out to retail investors (who own 45% of shares) emphasizing Sabadell's "bright prospects" as an independent entity. He claims that BBVA's offer significantly undervalues the bank and highlights execution risks if Spain's economy ministry blocks a merger after shareholders accept the bid.

BBVA must secure approval from various regulators, including the European Central Bank, before launching its tender offer to shareholders. The deal can proceed if a majority of Sabadell investors sell their shares; however, Spain's economy ministry will then rule on the proposed merger, which may not happen until 
2026. Hostile takeovers are rare in Spain and the lengthy approval process exposes the transaction to political volatility and potential government changes.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: What factors contribute to BBVA's bid being considered a hostile takeover, and how does this impact Sabadell's response strategy?
   A: The term "hostile takeover" refers to an acquisition attempt by one company (BBVA) without the consent or cooperation of the target company's management (Sabadell). In this case, BBVA made an all-share bid that was rejected by Sabadell's board. As a result, they went directly to retail shareholders with the same terms. This approach forces Sabadell into defensive mode and compels them to convince their investors of the bank's independent value and potential growth prospects.
   
2. Q: How does Spain's government opposition affect BBVA's bid, and what are the implications for both banks if a merger is blocked?
   A: The Spanish government opposes the deal due to concerns about competition, financial inclusion, and regional impact on Catalonia and Valencia. If shareholders accept BBVA's offer but Spain's economy ministry blocks the merger, it would result in significant adverse effects for both banks. BBVA would become the majority owner of two separate entities without the ability to integrate them or realize cost savings. This scenario could negatively impact shareholder value and create uncertainty about future growth prospects.
   
3. Q: What are the potential risks associated with the lengthy approval process for a hostile takeover in Spain, particularly concerning political volatility?
   A: The long approval process exposes the transaction to various risks, including changes in government and shifts in regulatory priorities. Political volatebility could lead to delays or even cancellation of the merger if a new administration opposes it. Additionally, Spain's economy ministry may take an extended period before ruling on the proposed merger, further prolonging uncertainty for both banks involved and their shareholders.
