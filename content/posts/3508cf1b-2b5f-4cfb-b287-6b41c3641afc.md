# **斯洛伐克总理罗伯特·菲佐在暗杀行动中受伤**

**斯洛伐克总理罗伯特·菲佐**在政府描述为**暗杀行动**中受重伤，多位政治家将此次袭击归因于该国严重的政治极化现象。菲佐在**汉德洛瓦**镇与人们见面时遭到多次枪击，随后被送往**班斯卡-比斯特里察**的一家医院接受紧急手术。一名持有枪支许可证的嫌疑人已被拘留，内政部长表示，袭击者可能出于明显的政治动机，与最近的总统选举有关。这起事件引起了人们对斯洛伐克深刻政治分歧的关注，一些人指责煽动性言论，而另一些人则指出菲佐之前曾收到过死亡威胁。这次枪击事件也引发了世界各国领导人的反应，呼吁在政治中缓和激烈的语言。

令人震惊的是，**斯洛伐克总理罗伯特·菲佐**在公然的**暗杀行动**中多次遭到枪击，生命垂危。当菲佐在汉德洛瓦镇与公民见面时发生的这次袭击事件在该国和政界引起了震动，许多人猜测背后的动机。

这位59岁的民粹主义者以**亲俄立场**闻名，他迅速被空运到附近的一家医院，医生们全力抢救他的生命。斯洛伐克政府将这一事件定性为暗杀行动，并迅速拘留了一名持有枪支许可证的嫌疑人。

**斯洛伐克内政部长马图什·舒塔·埃斯托克**表示，袭击者的动机可能是政治性的，并与菲佐的联合盟友、最近赢得总统选举的彼得·佩莱格里尼有关。分析人士米兰·尼奇指出，这次枪击事件暴露了斯洛伐克国内深刻的政治分歧，该国经常出现针对政治家的死亡威胁。

菲佐去年10月重返权力中心，领导一个**疑欧派联盟**，他的任期以有争议的决定为标志，包括解散一个反腐败机构和通过一项针对非政府组织的法律，这些决定引发了大规模抗议。

这次袭击事件引起了世界各国领导人的强烈谴责，其中包括**美国总统乔·拜登**和**欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩**，他们强调了反对破坏民主的暴力行为的重要性。

在菲佐接受手术时，这起事件严酷地提醒人们，煽动性的政治言论可能产生严重后果，也凸显了政治中需要更加文明和相互尊重的对话。

# Slovakia’s PM Robert Fico injured in assassination attempt

**Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico** was critically injured in what the government described as an **assassination attempt**, with several politicians attributing the attack to the country's stark political polarization. Fico was shot multiple times while greeting people in the town of **Handlová** and was transferred to a hospital in **Banská Bystrica** for emergency surgery. A suspect with a gun license was detained, and the interior minister suggested the attacker had a clear political motivation linked to the recent presidential election. The incident has brought attention to the deep political divisions in Slovakia, with some blaming inflammatory rhetoric and others pointing to previous death threats against Fico. The shooting has also sparked reactions from world leaders and calls for a toning down of vitriolic language in politics.

In a shocking development, **Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico** found himself fighting for his life after being shot multiple times in a brazen **assassination attempt**. The attack, which took place as Fico greeted citizens in the town of Handlová, has sent shockwaves through the country and the political world, with many speculating on the motives behind it. 

The 59-year-old populist, known for his **pro-Russian stance**, was quickly airlifted to a nearby hospital, where doctors worked feverishly to save his life. The Slovak government labeled the incident an assassination attempt, and a suspect with a gun license was promptly detained. 

**Slovakian Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok** suggested that the attacker's motivation was political and linked to the recent presidential election won by Fico's coalition ally, Peter Pellegrini. The shooting has brought to light the deep political divisions within Slovakia, a country plagued by regular death threats against politicians, according to analyst Milan Nič. 

Fico's return to power last October at the helm of a **Eurosceptic coalition** had sparked mass protests, and his tenure has been marked by contentious decisions, including the dissolution of an anti-corruption office and the passage of a law targeting NGOs. 

The attack has prompted an outpouring of condemnation from world leaders, including **US President Joe Biden** and **European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen**, who emphasized the importance of rejecting violent acts that undermine democracy. 

As Fico undergoes surgery, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of inflammatory political rhetoric and the need for a more civil and respectful dialogue in politics.
