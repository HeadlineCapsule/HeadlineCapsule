必和必拓390亿英镑收购英美资源公司计划失败

**摘要：**
必和必拓（BHP）对英美资源公司（Anglo American）390亿英镑的收购要约在为期六周的追求后破裂。必和必拓要求延长谈判时间，但被英美资源公司拒绝，导致这家澳大利亚采矿公司放弃收购企图，时间距离英国最后期限仅几分钟。拟议交易要求英美资源公司剥离某些业务，而被其董事会认为风险太大。英美资源公司股票收于2.458英镑，当日下跌4%。

**有趣的问题：**
问题1：必和必拓为何要收购英美资源公司？
答案1：必和必拓希望收购英美资源公司的铂金和库姆巴铁矿石业务，由于金属在能源转型中发挥着关键作用，这些业务预计将蓬勃发展。然而，他们对收购这些特定业务不感兴趣。拟议交易要求英美资源公司首先剥离它们，这对双方公司来说都是一个复杂的问题。

问题2：必和必拓的收购要约最终为何失败？
答案2：必和必拓390亿英镑收购要约失败的原因可以归因于几个因素。首先，拟议交易要求英美资源公司剥离某些业务，而被其董事会认为风险太大。其次，在六周的追求过程中，双方从未解决对价格和交易结构的分歧。最后，必和必拓在英国最后期限前几分钟要求延长谈判时间，以便做出具有约束力的要约或放弃收购，但被英美资源公司拒绝。

问题3：这次失败的收购要约可能会对两家公司及其股东产生什么影响？
答案3：390亿英镑收购要约的破裂可能对必和必拓、英美资源公司及其各自的股东产生各种影响。对于必和必拓来说，这代表着一个错失的机会，即通过收购英美资源公司的优质资产来扩大其在铜、铁矿石和化肥行业的投资组合。这可能会影响公司的增长前景和市场定位。另一方面，对于英美资源公司的股东来说，这次失败的要约可能导致股票价格短期下跌，正如在宣布当天，其股票收于24.58英镑，下跌了4%。然而，这也使他们能够专注于执行自己的重组计划，并有可能在铜、铁矿石和化肥行业的增长潜力中获益，而无需成为像必和必拓这样的大型企业集团的一部分。

**Summary:**  
BHP's £39bn takeover bid for Anglo American has collapsed after a six-week pursuit. BHP called for an extension to talks, which was rebuffed by Anglo American, leading the Australian mining company to abandon its attempt minutes before a UK deadline. The proposed deal required Anglo to demerge certain businesses and was considered too risky by Anglo's board. Shares in Anglo closed at £2n458, down 4% on the day.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: What were BHP's motivations for pursuing a takeover of Anglo American?  
A1: BHP was interested in acquiring Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore operations, which are expected to boom due to the metal’s crucial role in the energy transition. However, they had no interest in acquiring these specific businesses. The proposed deal required Anglo to demerge them first, making it a complex proposition for both companies.

Q2: Why did BHP's takeover bid ultimately fail?  
A2: The failure of BHP’s £39bn takeover bid can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the proposed deal required Anglo American to demerge certain businesses, which was considered too risky by Anglo's board. Secondly, disagreements over price and the structure of the deal remained unresolved throughout the six-week pursuit. Lastly, BHP called for an extension on talks just minutes before a UK deadline to make a binding offer or walk away, which was rebuffed by Anglo American.

Q3: How might this failed takeover bid impact both companies and their shareholders?  
A3: The collapse of the £39bn takeover bid may have various implications for BHP and Anglo American as well as their respective shareholders. For BHP, it represents a missed opportunity to expand its portfolio in copper, iron ore, and fertiliser sectors through acquiring Anglo's prized assets. This could potentially impact the company’s growth prospects and market positioning. On the other hand, for Anglo American shareholders, this failed bid may result in a short-term decline in stock prices as seen with shares closing at £24.58, down 4% on the day of the announcement. However, it also allows them to focus on executing their own restructuring plans and potentially capitalize on the growth prospects within copper, iron ore, and fertiliser sectors without being part of a larger conglomerate like BHP.
