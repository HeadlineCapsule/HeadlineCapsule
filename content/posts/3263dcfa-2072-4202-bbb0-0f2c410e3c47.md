KKR以13亿欧元收购欧洲音乐节所有者

**要点：**
- 美国私募股权公司 KKR 已同意以 13 亿欧元的价格收购英国集团 Superstruct Entertainment，这笔交易包括匈牙利的 Sziget 和德国的 Wacken Open Air 等欧洲音乐节。
- 受到新冠疫情严重影响的现场活动行业最近出现复苏迹象。
- Superstruct Entertainment 每年举办超过 80 场跨越 10 个国家的节日活动，吸引了大约 700 万人参与。
- KKR 从竞争对手私募股权公司 Providence Equity Partners 手中收购了该业务。Providence Equity Partners 于 2017 年创立了 Superstruct，作为收购更多音乐节的平台。
- 在收购后，Providence 有权向 Superstruct 投资 2.5 亿欧元。
- KKR 看到了 Superstruct 的重大增长机会，相信这笔交易将促进其欧洲私募股权投资组合的发展。

**背景：**
这次收购是欧洲更大的趋势的一部分，在欧洲，随着利率上升使交易执行更加具有挑战性，私募股权交易出现了一定的复苏。今年前五个月全球私募股权交易价值达到 2860 亿美元，比去年同期增长了 30% 以上。

**结论：**
KKR 对 Superstruct Entertainment 的收购体现了对现场活动行业的信心及其疫情后增长潜力。这笔交易也突显了 KKR 在欧洲的持续投资活动，重点是通过像这次这样的战略收购来扩大其投资组合。

 **Key Points:**
- US buyout firm KKR has agreed to acquire UK group Superstruct Entertainment for €1.3bn in a deal that includes European music festivals such as Hungary's Sziget and Germany's Wacken Open Air. 
- The live events industry, which was heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, has seen a resurgence recently.
- Superstruct Entertainment hosts over 80 festivals across 10 countries annually, attracting around 7 million people each year.
- KKR is acquiring the business from rival buyout firm Providence Equity Partners, which established Superstruct in eby 2017 as a vehicle to acquire more music festivals.
- Despite ceding ownership, Providence has an option to invest €250mn into Superstruct post-acquisition.
- KKR sees significant growth opportunities for Superstruct and believes the deal will contribute to its portfolio of European private equity investments.

**Context:**
The acquisition is part of a larger trend in Europe, where there has been a tentative recovery in buyout deals after higher interest rates made executing transactions more challenging. The value of PE deals globally reached $286bn in the first five months of this year, marking an increase of over 30% compared to the same period last year.

**Conclusion:**
KKR's acquisition of Superstruct Entertainment demonstrates confidence in the live events industry and its potential for growth post-pandemic. The deal also highlights KKR's continued investment activity across Europe, with a focus on expanding their portfolio through strategic acquisitions like this one.
