迈克·林奇告诉美国陪审团，Autonomy“并不完美”，但否认存在欺诈行为。

## 概要：
在一家美国联邦法院的审判中，英国科技企业家迈克·林奇（Mike Lynch）和前自治公司财务副总裁史蒂芬·钱伯林（Stephen Chamberlain）被控有多项电信欺诈和阴谋罪。指控与一项涉嫌在2011 年以 115 亿美元将该公司出售给惠普公司之前虚报收入的计划有关。林奇否认参与其中，声称自治公司在与惠普公司的交易前是一家成功的企业，他对审判中提及的欺诈性交易毫不知情。

## 有趣的问题：
**Q: 林奇和钱伯林被控采用的某些非法会计方法是什么？**
A: 他们被指控使用复杂的非法会计手段，包括销售回溯、与客户进行“往返”交易以及将硬件交易虚假装成软件交易。据称，这些行动是为了在惠普公司收购之前夸大自治公司的收入。

**Q: 林奇如何描述他与前自治公司首席财务官苏肖梵·侯赛因（Sushovan Hussain）的关系？**
A: 在审判中，林奇试图撇清与侯赛因的关系，否认他们是儿时朋友或亲密伙伴。他提到两人曾就读于同一所学校，但强调他们之间没有私人联系。此外，他还表示，如果可以重新选择，他会更早地处理好侯赛因越来越多地介入销售团队的事宜。

**Q: 林奇为自己涉入涉嫌欺诈交易提出了何种辩护？**
A：林奇声称自治公司“并不完美”，但它是一家成功的企业，在惠普收购之前就已拥有3亿美元的银行存款。他声明自己没有参与审判中提及的任何具体欺诈交易，也没有任何相关知识。他还争辩说，如果他试图阻止与惠普公司的交易，那他将不再是首席执行官。林奇还提到了自己在20世纪70年代作为爱尔兰移民子女在伦敦的平凡出身以及他对科技的早期兴趣

## Summary:
In a US federal court trial, British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and Autonomy's former vice-president of finance Stephen Chamberlain face multiple charges of wire fraud and conspiracy related to an alleged scheme involving overstating revenues ahead of the company's $11.5bn acquisition by Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch denies involvement, stating that Autonomy was a successful business prior to the deal with HP and he had no knowledge of the fraudulent transactions at issue in the trial.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: What were some of the alleged illegal accounting methods used by Mike Lynch and Stephen Chamberlain?
A: The article mentions that they are accused of using complex and illegal accounting methods, including backdating sales, engaging in "round trip" transactions with customers to pay them to buy products, and falsely dressing up hardware deals as software deals. These actions were allegedly part of a scheme to overstate Autonomy's revenues ahead of the acquisition by HP.

Q: How did Mike Lynch describe his relationship with Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former chief financial officer?
A: In the trial, Lynch distanced himself from Hussain and rejected any suggestion that they were childhood friends or close associates. He mentioned attending the same school but emphasized their lack of a personal connection. Additionally, he stated that if given the chance to do things differently, he would have addressed Hussain's growing involvement in the sales team sooner.

Q: What was Mike Lynch's defense regarding his role and knowledge of the alleged fraudulent transactions?
A: Lynch claimed that Autonomy "wasn't perfect," but it was a successful business, putting $300 million in the bank just before the HP acquisition. He stated he had no involvement or knowledge of the specific fraudulent transactions at issue in the trial and argued that if he tried to block the deal with HP, he would not be CEO. Lynch also mentioned his modest background as a child of Irish immigrants in London during the 1970s and his early interest in technology.
