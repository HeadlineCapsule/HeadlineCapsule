# 钢铁制造商警告英国政府有成为倾销地的风险

**英国钢铁行业** 对该国可能成为**低成本钢铁进口**的**倾销地**表示担忧，这与拟议中引入**碳边境税**的时间有关。该行业敦促政府**与欧盟在 2026 年统一步调**，认为如果推迟到 2027 年，高排放钢铁可能会转向英国市场。这一警告来自行业贸易机构“英国钢铁协会”（UK Steel）和著名生产商如“英国钢铁公司”（British Steel）和“塔塔钢铁公司”（Tata Steel）。**碳边境调整机制**旨在保护国内制造商免受碳排放成本较低的国外廉价产品的竞争。然而，英国政府认为这些担忧有些夸大，并指出欧盟的机制会逐渐实施，企业也有足够的时间适应变化。这一提议引发了行业与政府之间的辩论：行业担忧贸易转移，而政府则试图在环保目标和英国企业需求之间取得平衡。

# Steelmakers Warn Ministers That UK Faces Dumping Risk 

**Britain's steel industry has expressed concerns** about the potential for the country to become a **dumping ground** for **low-cost steel imports** due to the proposed timing of the introduction of a **carbon border tax**. The industry is urging the government to align the introduction of this tax with that of the EU in 2026, arguing that a delay until 2027 could result in high-emission steel being diverted to the UK market. This warning has been communicated by the industry trade body, UK Steel, and prominent producers such as British Steel and Tata Steel. The "carbon border adjustment mechanism" is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from competition by cheaper, foreign products that have lower carbon costs. However, the UK government believes the concerns are exaggerated, citing the gradual implementation of the EU's mechanism and the time needed for businesses to adapt. The proposal has sparked a debate between the industry, which fears trade diversion and the government, which aims to balance environmental goals with the needs of UK businesses.
