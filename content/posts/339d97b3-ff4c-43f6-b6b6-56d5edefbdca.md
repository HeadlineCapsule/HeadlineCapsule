欧洲CLO发行量创纪录，投资者追逐收益率

# 欧洲破纪录的CLO发行：投资者追逐收益

今年头五个月，在欧洲**抵押贷款支持证券（CLO）**发行方面出现前所未有的增长，发行量超过227亿欧元，因为投资者在低利率环境中寻求更高的收益。这一速度有可能打破2021年390亿欧元的发行记录，并超越多家银行之前的预测。

CLO是复杂金融工具，将各种垃圾贷款组合在一起，将其分为不同的评级，然后向投资者出售切片。尽管在2008年全球金融危机期间与抵押债务证券（CDO）有关，但由于与其他资产类别相比具有吸引力的收益，CLO在欧洲投资者中重新获得青睐。

对这些工具的需求是由多种因素驱动的：管理人员的发行成本降低，以及借款人比预期更好地偿还债务，表现强大。此外，将偿还投资者的现金回收并投入新发行的CLO进一步推动了需求。

目前，欧洲CLO管理资产达到2405亿欧元，而美国同行则达到1.07万亿美元。尽管公司履行贷款付款但避免从市场上获取新资本，因此新贷款稀缺，但高发行率仍在持续。

在欧洲，破纪录的CLO发行遵循美国的类似趋势，摩根士丹利上月将预测提高到1650亿美元，而瑞银集团（UBS）的Amir Vardi预计今年这两个市场的总额可能达到2000亿美元。

为了维持如此高的发行量，专家建议并购活动和杠杆收购活动需要同时增长。CLO市场未来的轨迹将取决于这些因素以及投资者在低利率环境中对创收资产的持续需求。

 # Summary Report on Record-Breaking European CLO Issuance Amidst Yield Chase by Investors

The first five months of this year have seen an unprecedented surge in the issuance of **collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)** within Europe, with over €22.7 billion being issued as investors seek higher yields amidst a low-interest environment. This rate is on track to potentially break 2021's record of €39 billion in issuance and surpass the previous forecast by several banks.

CLOs are complex financial instruments that pool together various junk loans, categorize them into different ratings, and sell slices to investors. Despite their association with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) during the 2008 global financial crisis, CLOs have regained favor among European investors due to attractive yields compared to other asset classes.

The demand for these vehicles has been driven by a combination of factors: lower issuance costs for managers and strong performance from borrowers who can service their debt better than expected. Additionally, the recycling of cash from repaid investors into newly issued CLOs has further bolstered demand.

European CLO assets under management currently stand at €240.5 billion, while US counterparts have reached $1.07 trillnion. The high issuance rate is occurring despite a scarcity of new underlying loans as companies meet their loan payments but refrain from tapping the market for fresh capital.

The record-breaking CLO issuance in Europe follows a similar trend in the US, where Morgan Stanley raised its forecast to $165 billion last month and Credit Suisse's Amir Vardi anticipates a potential total of around $200 billion this year for both markets.

To sustain such high levels of issuance, experts suggest that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity needs to pick up alongside leveraged buyout activities. The future trajectory of the CLO market will depend on these factors as well as continued investor appetite for yield-generating assets in a low-interest rate environment.
