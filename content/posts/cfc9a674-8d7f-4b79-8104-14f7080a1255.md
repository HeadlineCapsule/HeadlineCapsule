挪威石油基金将投票反对特斯拉向马斯克支付56亿美元的薪酬

**挪威石油基金将投票反对特斯拉对马斯克的薪酬奖励**

全球最大的主权财富基金，挪威1.7万亿美元的石油基金，也是特斯拉第八大股东，宣布将投票反对伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）提出的560亿美元薪酬奖励。该基金对该一揽子计划的规模、结构以及未能减轻“关键人物风险”表示担忧。

特斯拉股东定于周四举行会议，对这一前所未有的薪酬一揽子计划进行投票。此前，特拉华州的一名法官于1月份驳回了该奖励，称其为“不可思议的金额”。挪威基金持有特斯拉约1%的股份，截至2023年底，其价值约为80亿美元，自2018年首次提出该薪酬方案以来，一直反对这一薪酬一揽子计划。

两个著名的代理投票顾问机构，即机构股东服务（ISS）和玻璃路易斯（Glass Lewis），也建议股东拒绝马斯克的薪酬奖励。挪威基金采取了反对高额薪酬的一贯立场，特别是在美国，去年它投票反对了超过2000万美元的所有奖励中的半数以上。

石油基金首席执行官尼古拉·坦根（Nicolai Tangen）批评了企业贪婪及其对股东的稀释影响。尽管反对马斯克的薪酬一揽子计划，但挪威基金对特斯拉在马斯克领导下创造的巨大价值表示赞赏。该基金还计划投票赞成将特斯拉的注册地从特拉华州迁至德克萨斯州，因为马斯克对法官关于薪酬奖励的决定感到不满。

挪威石油基金进一步表示，它打算支持股东提出的倡导工会权利的提案，这与特斯拉在瑞典的现行立场相反。该公司目前正陷入一场长期的集体谈判纠纷中。

特斯拉为薪酬奖励辩护，称其创造了“超过7350亿美元的价值”，并相信股东将尊重他们2018年批准的交易。

 **Norway's Oil Fund to Vote Against Musk's Tesla Pay Award**

The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, Norway's $1.7tn oil fund and eighth-largest shareholder in Tesla, has announced it will vote against Elon Musk's proposed **$56bn pay award** at the electric carmaker. The fund expressed concerns about the size of the package, its structure, and how it fails to mit grope "key person risk".

Tesla shareholders are set to vote on this unprecedented remuneration package during a meeting scheduled for Thursday. This comes after a Delaware judge struck down the award in January, calling it an "unfathomable sum." The Norwegian fund owns approximately 1% of Tesla, valued at about $8bn as of the end of 2023 and has consistently opposed this pay package since its initial proposal in 2018.

Both ISS (Institutional Shareholder Services) and Glass Lewis, two prominent proxy advisers, have also recommended that shareholders reject Musk's pay award. The Norwegian fund has taken a more active stance against large pay packages, particularly in the US, where it voted against over half of all awards exceeding $20 million last year.

Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of the oil fund, criticized corporate greed and its impact on shareholders through dilution. Despite this opposition to Musk's pay package, the Norwegian fund expressed appreciation for the significant value generated under his leadership at Tesla. The fund also plans to vote in favor of moving Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas as a result of Musk's dissatisfaction with the judge's decision on the pay award.

The Norwegian oil fund further stated its intention to support a shareholder proposal advocating for trade union rights, which goes against Tesla's current stance in Sweden. The company is currently embroiled in a long-standing dispute over collective bargaining with Swedish unions.

Tesla has defended the pay award, stating that it has driven "more than $735bn in value creation" and expressing confidence that shareholders will honor the deal they approved back in cuadro 2018.
