肯尼亚爆发青年领导的抗议税收上涨的运动

肯尼亚目前正在发生由青年领导的抗议活动，反对总价值超过20亿美元的拟议增税。政府的《财政法案》旨在将预算赤字从GDP的5.7%减少到3.3%，这是国际货币基金组织（IMF）计划的一部分，该计划要求增加收入。

关键要点：
- 总统威廉·鲁托（William Ruto）的政府试图对各种物品征税，包括面包和卫生巾。
- 抗议活动遭到警方的强烈镇压，导致两人死亡，数百人受伤。
- 财政部长恩朱古纳·恩敦瓜（Njuguna Ndung'u）警告说，如果不通过该法案，可能会造成15亿美元的预算缺口。
- 鲁托因取消燃料补贴和征收新税而受到批评，并获得了“扎卡约”（Zakayo）的绰号。
- 政府最初同意撤回对某些产品的拟议税收，但抗议活动仍在继续。
- 抗议者正在计划一场“占领议会”运动，要求鲁托完全放弃《财政法案》。

背景：
肯尼亚的经济一直在努力应对流动性挑战，最近支付了20亿美元的欧元债券以缓解投资者对潜在违约的担忧，例如在埃塞俄比亚、加纳和赞比亚所看到的情况。国际货币基金组织（IMF）作为2021年开始的一揽子救助计划的一部分，提供了9.41亿美元的额外贷款，当时鲁托是副总统。

影响：
总统鲁托面临着如何在安抚IMF和肯尼亚民众之间取得平衡的挑战，后者投票将他送上权力宝座，期待他减轻他们的经济负担。

 **Summary of Article:**  
Kenya is experiencing widespread youth-led protests against proposed tax hikes totaling over $2 billion in new revenue. The government's finance bill aims to reduce the budget deficit from 5.7% of GDP to 3.3%, as part of an IMF program requiring increased revenues.

**Key Points:**  
- President William Ruto's administration seeks to tax various items, including bread and sanitary pads.
- The protests have been met with a strong police response, resulting in two deaths and hundreds of injuries.
- Treasury Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u warns that failing to pass the bill could create a $1.5 billion budget hole.
- Ruto has faced criticism for removing fuel subsidies and levying new taxes, earning him the nickname "Zakayo."
- The government initially agreed to withdraw planned taxes on certain products but protests have continued.
- Protesters are planning an “occupy parliament” campaign demanding that Ruto drops the finance bill entirely.

**Context:**  
Kenya's economy has been grappling with liquidity challenges, and it recently paid off its $2 billion Eurobond to alleviate investor concerns about potential defaults like those seen in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zambia. The IMF provided an additional loan of $941 million as part of a larger bailout package that began in 2021 when Ruto was deputy president.

**Implications:**  
President Ruto faces the challenge of balancing appeasing both the IMF and the Kenyan populace, who voted him into power with expectations for easing their financial burden.
