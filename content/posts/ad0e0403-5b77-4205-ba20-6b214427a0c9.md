# 美元民族主义对世界经济的危害 

**美元在全球经济中的主导地位** 是把双刃剑。它促进了国际贸易，支持了美国的经常账户赤字，但也通过其在**金融制裁**中的使用，赋予了**美国巨大的权力**。随着全球地缘政治紧张局势的升温，由**惩罚性对抗**与**商业合作**混合而成的这一体系能否持久尚不确定。本文探讨了美元霸权面临的潜在威胁，包括**美国加息**的影响、以**唐纳德·特朗普**为代表的货币体系政治化，以及新兴大国对**替代性储备货币**的讨论日益增多。受国内政治和经济因素影响的美国政策制定者的决策将塑造全球货币体系的未来，并对世界经济产生潜在影响。 

美元强弱受多种因素影响，包括美国货币政策和美国经济健康状况。当美元强势时，会给全球以美元计价的企业带来压力。虽然其他国家的央行可以采取措施管理贬值，但汇率大幅波动和持续高企的美国利率可能会将 "美元问题 "推向政治领域。美元价值的近期飙升已经对全球最贫穷国家造成了严重损害，人们还担心美国可能过度使用金融制裁，这可能会削弱对美元的信心。 

本文最后强调，美元体系的未来与美国自身的政经发展紧密相连。美国政策制定者的决定和行动受国内因素影响，但也可能外溢影响全球经济，带来正面或负面的结果。

# Dangers of Dollar Nationalism Hang Over the World Economy 

**The dominance of the US dollar** in the global economy is a double-edged sword. While it facilitates international trade and supports the US current account deficit, it also gives the **American state significant power** through its use in **financial sanctions**. As global geopolitical tensions rise, the durability of this hybrid system of **punitive confrontation** and **commercial cooperation** is uncertain. The article explores the potential threats to the dollar's hegemony, including the impact of **US interest rate hikes**, the politicization of the currency system by figures like **Donald Trump**, and the increasing discussion of **alternative reserve currencies** by emerging powers. The decisions made by US policymakers, influenced by domestic politics and economics, will shape the future of the global monetary system, with potential repercussions for the world economy.

The strength of the dollar is influenced by a variety of factors, including US monetary policy and the health of the American economy. When the dollar is strong, it can put pressure on dollar-denominated businesses worldwide. While central banks in other countries can take measures to manage depreciation, large exchange rate swings and prolonged high US interest rates could push the "dollar question" into the political realm. The recent surge in the dollar's value has already caused significant damage to the world's poorest countries, and there are concerns about the potential overuse of US financial sanctions, which could erode confidence in the dollar. 

/n/n

The article concludes by emphasizing that the future of the dollar system is intricately tied to the politics and economics of the US itself. The decisions and actions of US policymakers, shaped by domestic considerations, have the potential to spill over and impact the global economy, for better or worse.
