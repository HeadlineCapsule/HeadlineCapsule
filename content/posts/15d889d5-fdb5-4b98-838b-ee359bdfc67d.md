拉里·埃里森的“极端帆船”重返纽约，同时规划扩张

# 甲骨文联合创始人拉里·埃里森的职业帆船联盟 SailGP 旨在通过全球扩张和盈利能力成为“水上运动的 F1”。该比赛于 2019 年重返纽约，在微风中举行了第二场比赛。

## 要点：
- **SailGP** 的双体船设计用于高速航行，由于能够水翼升离水面，速度可达近 100 公里/小时。这一特点使 SailGP 与 F1 汽车赛车赛事相似。
- 该联盟计划在明年就实现盈利，并推出由穆巴达拉赞助的巴西队，进入第五个赛季。
- **安德鲁·汤普森**（Andrew Thompson）是 SailGP 的管理总监，他表示该联盟预计在下个赛季结束时或更早时候就能实现收支平衡。
- 目前，CBS 和在线平台的媒体收入相对较低。然而，来自高盛等华尔街公司的赞助却做出了重大贡献。
- 由于私募股权投资，对像 SailGP 这样的新兴体育联盟的投资正在增加，一些分析师认为，不断上涨的估值可能是由主要体育联盟价格上涨造成的。
- 预计到第五个赛季结束时，SailGP 的球队将不再由该联盟拥有，而是落在第三方手中。

 **Article Summary:** Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison's professional sailing league, SailGP, aims to become the "Formula cuedbdbdbd1 of water sports" through global expansion and profitability. The competition returned to New York in 2019 with its second race held amid light winds.

**Key Points:**
- **SailGP's** catamarans are designed for high speeds, reaching up to almost 100km/h due to their ability to foil and lift out of the water. This feature gives SailGP a resemblance to Formula 1 auto racing events.
- The league plans to grow into profitability as soon as next year with Mubadala's sponsorship, launching a Brazilian team in its fifth season.
- **Andrew Thompson**, managing director of SailGP, stated that the league is forecasted to break even by the end of next season or possibly earlier.
- Media revenue from broadcasts on CBS and online platforms remains relatively low for now. However, sponsorships from Wall Street firms like Citadel have contributed significantly.
- The investment in emerging sports leagues such as SailGP is increasing due to private equity investments, with some analysts suggesting that rising valuations may result from being priced out of major sports leagues.
- By the end of season five, it's expected that none of the teams will be owned by SailGP and instead will be in third-party hands.
