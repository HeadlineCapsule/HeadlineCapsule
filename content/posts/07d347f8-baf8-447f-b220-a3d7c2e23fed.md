安本需要新的思路才能有机会复兴

## 摘要：

标准人寿与阿伯丁于 2017 年合并后的阿伯丁 (Abrdn) 在试图重振自身后面临着挑战，首席执行官斯蒂芬·伯德 (Stephen Bird) 的离职凸显了这一点。该公司在管理自己的投资组合方面面临困难，尽管其投资业务贡献了阿伯丁收入的三分之二，但投资者对其价值却很低。成本削减措施未取得预期效果，与施罗德 (Schroders) 和安联 (Amundi) 等竞争对手相比，其间接费用仍然很高。伯德将该公司转变为储蓄提供商的努力，包括收购互动投资者等，因其基金管理业务表现不佳而受到影响。董事会去年拒绝了伯德提出的拆分战略，导致他离职。要重振拥有 3670 亿英镑资产管理业务的阿伯丁，需要认识到不同的战略可能需要单独的领导。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 斯蒂芬·伯德作为阿伯丁的首席执行官任期内成功的因素有哪些？

   A1：斯蒂芬·伯德的任期未取得成功，原因包括他在消费者银行背景而不是基金管理方面，以及董事会缺乏在英国市场扭转局面的专业知识。此外，成本削减措施未取得预期效果，与竞争对手相比，间接费用仍然很高，投资者对阿伯丁的投资业务价值很低，尽管它贡献了收入的三分之二。

2. 阿伯丁的间接费用与施罗德和安联的比较如何？

   A2：在阿伯丁，不包括薪酬的间接费用占总成本的一半，这远高于施罗德（不到 40%）和法国安联等竞争对手。这表明阿伯丁可能存在低效率或过度支出问题。

3. 鉴于阿伯丁面临的挑战，它可以采取哪些潜在战略来振兴公司？

   A3：阿伯丁振兴的潜在战略包括探索拆分战略，将业务的不同单位分开，并允许它们由专业领导管理。这将涉及为其独立金融顾问平台、互动投资者收购和其他非基金管理单位寻找感兴趣的买家或合作伙伴。此外，阿伯丁还可以专注于提高其基金管理业务的表现，可能通过重组工作、人才引进和创新来更好地与被动基金和行业趋势竞争。

## Summary:
Abrdn's struggle to revive itself after the 201^7 merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen has been highlighted by the departure of its CEO, Stephen Bird. The company faces challenges in managing its own portfolio, with investors attributing little value to its investment business despite it providing two-thirds of Abrdn's revenues. Cost cutting measures have not yielded desired results and overhead costs remain high compared to competitors like Schroders and Amundi. Bird's efforts in transforming the company into a savings provider, including acquisitions such as interactive investor, have been overshadowed by its underperforming fund management business. The board rejected a breakup strategy proposed by Bird last year, leading to his departure. Reviving Abrdn with £367bn of assets under management will require the recognition that different strategies may need separate leadership.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What factors contributed to Stephen Bird's unsuccessful tenure as CEO at Abrdn?
A1: Several factors contributed to Stephen Bird's unsuccessful tenure, including his background in consumer banking rather than fund management and the board's lack of expertise in tackling a turnaround in the troubled UK market. Additionally, cost-cutting measures did not yield desired results, overhead costs remained high compared to competitors, and investors attributed little value to Abrdn's investment business despite it providing two-thirds of its revenues.

Q2: How do Abrdn's overhead costs compare with those of Schroders and Amundi?
A2: At Abrdn, overhead excluding remuneration accounts for half of the total costs, which is significantly higher than competitors like Schroders (under 40%) and France's Amundi. This indicates that Abrdn may have inefficiencies or excessive expenses compared to its peers.

Q3: What potential strategies could Abrdn pursue to revitalize the company, considering the challenges it faces?
A3: Potential strategies for Abrdn's revival include exploring a breakup strategy that separates different units of the business and allows them to be managed by specialized leaders. This would involve finding interested buyers or partners for its independent financial adviser platform, interactive investor acquisition, and other non-fund management units. Additionally, Abrdn could focus on improving performance in its fund management business, potentially through restructuring efforts, talent acquisition, and innovation to better compete with passive funds and industry trends.
