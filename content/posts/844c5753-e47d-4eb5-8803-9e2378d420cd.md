唐纳德·特朗普在“封口费”审判中的命运掌握在12名纽约人的手中

**摘要：**
唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的“封口费”审判结果现在由12名纽约人决定，他们担任陪审员。他们昨天开始审议，随时可能做出裁决。如果他们在针对特朗普的所有刑事指控中达成一致，由于各种后勤原因，他不太可能立即被关押。然而，如果被判有罪，这可能会对他的政党和潜在的未来总统抱负产生重大政治影响。

**问题：**

1. 这次审判可能有什么结果？它们如何影响特朗普的政治生涯或遗产？
2. 您能否提供更多背景信息，说明为什么如果被定罪，特朗普不太可能立即被关押？
3. 有罪判决将如何影响共和党及其未来的方向，尤其是2024年潜在的总统候选人？
4. 控方和辩方在审判期间提出了哪些关键论点？
5. 是否有任何先例或类似案件可以为这种情况的发展提供见解？

**Summary:**
Donald Trump's fate in his "hush money" trial is now in the hands of 12 New Yorkers who are serving as jurors. They began deliberations yesterday and could hand down a verdict at any moment. If they reach a unanimous decision on each of the cuirits criminal charges against Trump, it's unlikely that he would be immediately locked up due to various logistical reasons. However, if convicted, there may be significant political implications for both his party and potential future presidential aspirations.

**Questions:**
1. What are the possible outcomes of this trial? How might they impact Trump's political career or legacy?
2. Can you provide more context on why it is unlikely that Trump would be immediately locked up if convicted in this case?
3. How could a guilty verdict affect the Republican Party and its future direction, particularly with regard to potential presidential candidates for 2024?
4. What are some of the key arguments presented by both the prosecution and defense during the trial?
5. Are there any precedents or similar cases that might provide insight into how this situation could unfold?
