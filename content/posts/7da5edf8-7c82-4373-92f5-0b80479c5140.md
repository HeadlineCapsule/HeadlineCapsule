英格兰银行会发出降息信号吗？

# 英格兰银行的利率决定和欧元区的经济复苏

这篇文章讨论了两个主要话题：1）英格兰银行（BoE）调整利率的可能性；2）欧元区经济复苏的迹象。

## 英格兰银行的利率决定
- 市场预期表明，在周四的货币政策委员会会议上，BoE将维持目前的利率，保持在16年来的高位5.25%。
- 此前，决策者暗示可能在6月降息；然而，最近的经济增长和工资扩张减少了这种可能性的发生。
- 即将于7月举行的大选也可能影响BoE的决定，以避免在那之前进行任何利率调整。
- 分析师将密切关注会议记录的措辞，寻找未来降息的可能迹象，尤其是8月的降息。
- 将于周三发布的5月通胀数据可能会进一步明确利率变化的可能性。经济学家预测，价格增长将从4月的2.3%放缓到BoE的目标2%。

## 欧元区经济复苏
- 尽管劳动密集型服务部门的高工资保持了较高的价格压力，但欧元区经济在今年年初表现出复苏的迹象。
- 在欧洲中央银行（ECB）降息后，投资者将关注S&P全球业务活动调查，以评估这些积极趋势是否持续到6月。
- 大多数经济学家预计，欧元区的6月采购经理人指数（PMI）将略有改善，从52.2上升到52.5。PMI分数高于50表明与前一个月相比出现增长。
- 最近的报告表明，价格压力正在缓解，但服务部门的价格压力仍然很高，因为工人试图恢复失去的购买力导致工资增长强劲。ECB官员希望看到更多价格压力减弱的迹象，预计服务公司的定价能力将继续减弱。

## 美国零售销售数据
- 投资者预计美国5月的零售销售数据将稳健，这可能表明在高利率和增加的借贷成本背景下消费者支出的韧性。
- 预计人口普查局将报告整体零售销售比4月持平时增长0.2%。如果排除汽车销售这一波动较大的类别，预期月度增速仍为0.2%。
- 美国银行分析师估计，头寸数字可能略高，达到0.3%，并指出纪念日旅行支出可能不会完全反映在零售销售中，因为许多支出将用于服务。

 # Summary of the Article: Bank of England's Interest Rate Decision and Eurozone Economic Recovery

The article discusses two main topics: 1) The possibility of an interest rate change by the **Bank of England** (BoE), and 2) Signs of recovery in the **Eurozone economy**.

## Bank of England Interest Rate Decision
- Market expectations suggest that the BoE will maintain its current interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% during their monetary policy committee meeting on Thursday.
- Previously, policymakers hinted at a potential rate cut as early as June; however, recent economic growth and wage expansion have reduced the likelihood of this happening.
- The upcoming general election on July e may also influence the BoE's decision to avoid any changes in rates before that date.
- Analysts will closely examine the wording of the minutes from the meeting for possible indications of a future rate cut, particularly in August.
- May inflation data, set to be released on Wednesday, may provide further clarity regarding the possibility of an interest rate change. Economists predict that price growth will slow down to the BoE's target of 2% from April's figure of 2.3%.

## Eurozone Economic Recovery
- The **Eurozone economy** has shown signs of recovery since the beginning of this year, despite high wages in the labour-intensive services sector keeping price pressures elevated.
- Following interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB), investors will monitor the S&P Global survey of business activity to assess whether these positive trends continue into June.
- Most economists anticipate a slight improvement in the Eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) for June, with an expected rise from 52.2 to 52.5. A PMI score above 50 indicates growth compared to the previous month.
- Recent reports suggest that price pressures are easing but remain high in the services sector due to strong wage growth as workers seek to regain lost purchasing power. ECB officials hope for more signs of these pressures fading, with a weakening in pricing power among service firms expected to continue.

## US Retail Sales Data
- Investors anticipate solid retail sales data for May from the United States, which may offer insights into consumer spending resilience amidst high interest rates and increased borrowing costs.
- The Census Bureau is projected to report a 0.2% increase in overall retail sales compared with April's flat reading. Stripping out car sales, another volatile category, the expected monthly rate remains at 0.2%.
- Bank of America analysts estimate that headline figures could be slightly higher at 0.3%, noting that Memorial Day travel spending may not fully reflect in retail sales as much would have been spent on services.
