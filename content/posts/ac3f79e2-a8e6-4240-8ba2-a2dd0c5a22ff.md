# 英国欺诈调查局重新审查利率操纵案判决，因披露问题引发关注

由于披露软件系统存在问题，**英国严重欺诈调查局（SFO）** 正在重新审查其**伦敦银行同业拆放利率（Libor）** 操纵案的起诉，包括前**瑞银（UBS）和高盛（Citigroup）交易员汤姆·海耶斯（Tom Hayes）** 的案件。该机构**首席运营官（COO）阿比盖尔·霍沃思（Abigail Howarth）** 透露，SFO 正在评估其在调查关键**利率基准操纵**案时是否遗漏了任何文件。此次审查是更广泛复审的一部分，涉及受到 SFO 披露工具问题影响的可能超过十几个案件，重点关注涉案人员仍被羁押的案件，如**哈乐昆集团（Harlequin Group）**、**巴厘钢铁公司（Balli Steel Plc）** 和**全球林业投资（Global Forestry Investments）** 调查。

SFO 的披露问题最初于 2022 年与其旧的披露工具**自主深入分析（Autonomy Introspect）** 一起浮出水面，现在其当前系统**OpenText Axcelerate** 也出现了同样的问题。该机构成立了一个名为 "**金组（Gold Group）** " 的管理层委员会来监督审查工作，并聘请外部专家确保其方法和解决方案的有效性。海耶斯已经在监狱中服刑五年半，现正寻求向最高法院上诉。他的律师**卡伦·托德纳（Karen Todner）** 欢迎 SFO 优先审查 IBOR 案件的披露问题。SFO 长期存在的披露问题导致了几起备受瞩目的案件的崩塌，包括因自主问题导致的**三名前捷卫安（G4S）高管** 起诉的失败，该问题与标点符号识别有关。

SFO 正积极应对这些问题，对正在进行的起诉重新进行搜索，并在流程的早期阶段与法官和辩护方讨论披露策略。

# Libor convictions reviewed by UK fraud agency in wake of disclosure problems

The **UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO)** is re-examining its **Libor** prosecutions, including the case of **former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes**, due to issues with its disclosure software systems. The agency's **COO, Abigail Howarth**, revealed that the SFO is assessing whether any documents were missed during its investigation into the rigging of the key **interest-rate benchmark**. This review is part of a broader re-examination of likely more than a dozen cases affected by problems with the SFO's disclosure tools, with a focus on cases where individuals are still in custody, such as the **Harlequin Group**, **Balli Steel Plc**, and **Global Forestry Investments** investigations. 

The SFO's disclosure issues first surfaced in 2022 with its legacy disclosure tool, **Autonomy Introspect**, and have now emerged with its current system, **OpenText Axcelerate**. The agency has established a management-level committee, the '**Gold Group**', to oversee the review and is engaging external experts to ensure the effectiveness of its approach and solutions. Hayes, who served five-and-a-half years in prison, is seeking an appeal of his conviction in the Supreme Court. His lawyer, **Karen Todner**, welcomed the SFO's priority review of the IBOR cases' disclosure. The SFO's long-standing disclosure problems have contributed to the collapse of several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of **three former G4S executives** due to the Autonomy issue involving punctuation recognition. 

The SFO is proactively addressing these issues by re-running searches on live prosecutions and discussing disclosure strategies with judges and the defense at earlier stages of the process.
