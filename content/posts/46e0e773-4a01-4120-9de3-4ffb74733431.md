英格兰银行债券销售导致现金短缺

# 英格兰银行面临现金短缺

英格兰银行（BoE）因积极出售政府债券而导致货币市场出现现金短缺，这是量化紧缩措施的一部分。这导致了投资者使用BoE特殊回购协议设施的增加，上周借贷金额为160亿英镑，而本月初则不到50亿英镑。巴克莱银行、美国银行和国民西敏寺银行的分析师认为，现金短缺可能会促使BoE在9月政策审查时放慢其资产负债表缩减的速度。

BoE行长安德鲁·贝利（Andrew Bailey）对回购协议的使用表示鼓励，并预计其使用量将显著增加。然而，分析师认为，确保货币市场平稳运行的中央银行资产负债表的稳定状态可能远大于预期。

## Summary:
The Bank of England (BoE) is facing a cash shortage in money markets due to its active sale of government bonds as part of quantitative tightening measures. This has led to increased usage of the BoE's special repo facility, with investors borrowing £1n 6bn last week compared to less than £5bn early this month. Analysts from Barclays, Bank of America and NatWest suggest that the scarcity of cash could prompt the BoE to slow down its balance sheet reduction process when reviewing policy in September. The repo facility usage is seen as encouraging by BoE governor Andrew Bailey, who expects a significant increase in its use. However, analysts believe that the steady state size of the central bank's balance sheet for smooth money market functioning could be considerably larger than anticipated.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How has the Bank of England's active sale of government bonds impacted short-term lending rates and cash availability in money markets?
A1: The BoE's active sale of government bonds as part of quantitative tightening measures has led to a scarcity of cash in money markets. This, in turn, caused surges in short-term lending rates and increased usage of the special repo facility by investors seeking access to short-term cash.
Q2: What are some potential consequences if the Bank of England continues with its current pace of quantitative tightening?
A2: If the BoE maintains its current pace of quantitative tightening, it could lead to a continued scarcity of cash in money markets and higher short-term lending rates. This may hinder the effectiveness of the central bank's monetary policy at a time when interest rate cuts are expected.
Q3: What factors might influence the Bank of England's decision on whether to slow down its balance sheet reduction process in September?
A3: The BoE will likely consider several factors, including the scarcity of cash and increased usage of the repo facility, as well as market conditions such as short-term lending rates. Additionally, analysts believe that a significant volume of gilts owned by the BoE maturing next year may also influence their decision to slow down active gilt sales from September onwards.
