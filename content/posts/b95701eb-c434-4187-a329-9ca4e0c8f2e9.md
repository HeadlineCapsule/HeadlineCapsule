# 通货膨胀到底是什么？

**通货膨胀的测量** 是一个复杂且有时武断的过程，不同的指数，如**CPI**和**PCE**，提供了对相同经济现象的不同观点。这篇文章深入探讨了这些措施的怪癖和复杂性，凸显了**美联储**、市场和公众在理解和应对通胀数据时面临的挑战。

虽然**CPI**和PCE被广泛使用，但它们的计算方法不同，导致结果存在差异。 CPI基于**家庭购买调查**，而PCE则侧重于**商业销售**。 PCE还考虑到**替代效应**，当价格上涨时，消费者会转购买更便宜的替代品。 Bancreek Capital Advisors的**Eric Pachman**指出，这些在范围、权重和公式方面的差异可能会导致对通货膨胀的不同观点。 Pachman对篮子中个项目的分析显示，CPI和PCE之间存在显着差异，突显了通货膨胀目标和交易的武断性质。

这篇文章重点介绍了指数怪癖的具体示例，例如PCE的**投资组合管理组件**由于与标准普尔500指数的关联性而一直较高，而汽车保险的CPI和PCE计算也存在显着差异。这些差异在现实世界中有着重大影响，因为它们影响美联储的货币政策决策和市场预期。 结论呼吁关注**经济基本面**，而不是武断的数据怪癖，并建议审查自20世纪90年代以来未更新的通货膨胀测量方法。

# What even is inflation?

**Inflation measurement** is a complex and sometimes arbitrary process, with different indices, such as the **CPI** and **PCE**, providing varying perspectives on the same economic phenomenon. The article delves into the quirks and complexities of these measures, highlighting the challenges faced by the **Fed**, markets, and the general public in understanding and reacting to inflation data. 

/n/n

While the **CPI** and **PCE** are widely used, their calculations differ, leading to discrepancies in results. The CPI is based on a **survey of household purchases**, while the PCE focuses on **business sales**. The PCE also accounts for **substitution effects**, adjusting for consumers switching to cheaper alternatives when prices rise. These differences in scope, weights, and formulas can lead to varying inflation perspectives, as illustrated by **Eric Pachman** of Bancreek Capital Advisors. Pachman's analysis of individual basket items reveals significant variations between the CPI and PCE, underscoring the arbitrary nature of inflation targeting and trading. 

/n/n

The article highlights specific examples of quirks in the indices, such as the PCE's **portfolio management component**, which has been running high due to its correlation with the S&P 500, and auto insurance, where the CPI and PCE calculations differ significantly. These discrepancies have real-world implications, as they influence the Fed's monetary policy decisions and market expectations. The conclusion calls for a focus on **economic fundamentals** rather than arbitrary data quirks and suggests a review of inflation measurement methods, which have not been updated since the 1990s.
