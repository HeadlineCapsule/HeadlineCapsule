# CVC 同意出售陷入困境的非洲茶园业务

**CVC**，一家**私募股权集团**，已同意将其**利普顿茶和混合饮料**业务出售给**斯里兰卡综合企业**布朗斯集团（**Browns Group**），该业务包括位于东非的争议性**茶园**。此次出售距离 CVC 以 45 亿欧元从**联合利华**收购这些茶园不到三年时间。交易金额未披露，但所得收益将重新投资于一项改造茶叶行业的计划，重点是提高**工资和工作条件**，并遵守**环境、社会和治理标准**。

出售这些茶园，特别是肯尼亚的**凯里乔茶园**，意义重大，因为那里有着暴力和性虐待的历史。 CVC 的**利普顿**品牌包括**PG Tips** 和 **Pukka** 等知名茶叶品牌，一直致力于提高茶叶质量和工人福利。作为协议的一部分，布朗斯集团已同意每年按利普顿的 ESG 标准种植 8,700 万公斤茶叶。

此次出售还解决了当地社区所有权和历史不公正问题。一个肯尼亚合作社联合体曾表示有意购买这些庄园，以将土地归还给被驱逐氏族的后裔，但据报道他们的出价被忽视。为弥补这一点，利普顿已向当地社区提供肯尼亚运营公司 15% 的股份，并将向社区福利信托基金投资 10 亿肯尼亚先令（700 万欧元）。

此次交易使属于**LOLC 控股**的布朗斯集团成为世界上最大的茶叶出口商，并增加了其在斯里兰卡和肯尼亚现有的茶叶、胡椒和橡胶种植园。同时，出售也使 CVC 摆脱了与拥有这些争议性茶园相关的挑战和责任，这些茶园曾面临反对机械化的抗议活动和对工人依赖问题的批评。

# CVC agrees sale of troubled Africa tea estates business

CVC, a **private equity group**, has agreed to sell its **Lipton Teas and Infusions** business, which includes controversial **tea plantations** in East Africa, to **Browns Group**, a **Sri Lankan conglomerate**. The sale comes less than three years after CVC acquired the plantations from **Unilever** for €4.5bn. The transaction amount is undisclosed, but the proceeds will be reinvested in a program to transform the tea industry, with a focus on improving **wages and working conditions** and adhering to **environmental, social, and governance standards**. 

/n/n

The sale of the plantations, particularly the **Kericho plantation in Kenya**, is significant due to its history of **violence and sexual abuse**. CVC's **Lipton** brand, which includes well-known tea brands such as **PG Tips** and **Pukka**, has been working to improve the quality of tea and the welfare of workers. As part of the deal, Browns has agreed to grow 87 million kg of tea annually to Lipton's ESG standards. 

/n/n

The sale also addresses issues of local community ownership and historical injustices. A consortium of Kenyan cooperatives had expressed interest in buying the estates to restore the land to descendants of evicted clans, but their offer was reportedly ignored. To rectify this, Lipton has offered 15% of shares in the Kenyan operating company to local communities and will invest 1 billion Kenyan shillings (€7 million) in a community welfare trust. 

/n/n

The transaction makes Browns, owned by **LOLC Holdings**, the world's largest tea exporter and adds to its existing tea, pepper, and rubber plantations in Sri Lanka and Kenya. The sale also relieves CVC of the challenges and responsibilities associated with owning the controversial plantations, which have faced protests against mechanization and criticism for worker dependencies.
