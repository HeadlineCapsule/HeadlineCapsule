挪威停电后，欧洲天然气价格上涨13%

# 欧洲天然气价格因挪威停机事件上涨13%

由于挪威一家天然气处理厂出现故障，欧洲天然气价格周一大幅跳涨，创今年最高水平。这一事件凸显了挪威供应对欧洲日益重要的作用，因为欧洲减少了对俄罗斯进口的依赖。

## 要点：
- 欧洲基准**TTF**价格飙升超过38欧元/兆瓦时，上涨超过13%。其价格自12月初以来达到最高位，表明尽管欧洲天然气库存接近记录水平，但市场仍很波动。
- 挪威是欧洲最大的天然气供应国，在莫斯科于2022年入侵乌克兰后，俄罗斯的管道交付量减少，挪威去年占欧洲供应量的**30%**。挪威的未计划停机往往会导致市场的剧烈反应。
- 截至周六，欧盟的天然气储存地超过**70%**满，分析师认为它们可能在夏天达到满负荷。欧盟委员会设定了到11月达到90%储存水平的目标。
- LSEG欧洲天然气研究总监Wayne Bryan表示，价格上涨突显了供应来源减少后的脆弱性和过度依赖。在库存接近欧盟规定的水平之前，欧洲天然气价格将保持高位，并容易受到任何供应中断导致的价格波动的影响。

## 停机细节：
停机发生在挪威的**Nyhamna天然气厂**，该厂每天处理能力为7980万立方米。挪威国有公司Gassco表示，该厂将关闭一段“不确定的时间”。ICIS的Tom Marzec-Manser认为，这次停机可能会导致挪威的供应量减少**20%**以上。

## 全球影响：
由于热浪，亚洲对液化天然气（LNG）的需求也在增加，这意味着欧洲天然气价格必须保持较高水平，以吸引该地区的LNG货物。全球LNG供需失衡加剧了供应紧张局势，挪威和俄罗斯的管道供应是更直接的担忧。

总之，欧洲天然气价格的近期上涨突显了市场的脆弱性和对较小供应来源的过度依赖。随着欧洲继续减少对俄罗斯进口的依赖，像Nyhamna这样的未计划停机可能会对该地区的能源安全和价格稳定产生重大影响。

# **European Gas Price Surges 13% After Norwegian Outage**

The European gas price experienced a significant jump on Monday, reaching its highest level this year due to an outage at a gas processing plant in Norway. This event underscores the increasingly crucial role of Norwegian supplies for Europe after reducing reliance on Russian imports.

## Key Points:
- **European benchmark TTF** price surged past €38 per megawatt hour, marking an increase of more than 13%. The rise to its highest since early December indicates that the market remains volatile despite near-record levels of gas storage in Europe.
- Norway is now the single largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, accounting for **30%** of the bloc's supplies last year after most pipeline deliveries from Russia were cut following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Unplanned outages in Norway tend to cause a sharp reaction in the market.
- Gas storage sites in the EU are more than **70% full** as of Saturday, with analysts believing they could be at capacity by summer. The European Commission has set a target to reach 90% storage levels by November.
- Wayne Bryan, director of European gas research at LSEG, stated that the surge in prices highlights the fragility and increased overreliance on a smaller pool of supply sources. Until storages approach EU-mandated levels, European gas prices will remain elevated and vulnerable to heightened price volatility from any disruption in supply.

## Outage Details:
The outage occurred at the **Nyhamna gas plant** in Norway, which has a capacity of processing 79.8 million cubic meters per day. The Norwegian state-owned company Gassco reported that the plant is scheduled to be down for an "uncertain duration." Tom Marzec-Manser from ICIS suggested that this outage could potentially cut Norwegian flows by more than **20%**.

## Global Impact:
Asia's demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is also increasing due to a heatwave, which means European gas prices need to remain higher in order to attract LNG cargoes from the region. The global LNG balance shortness into winter adds to the tightness of supply, with Norwegian and Russian pipeline supplies being of more immediate concern.

In conclusion, this recent surge in European gas prices highlights the market's fragility and increased reliance on a smaller pool of supply sources. As Europe continues to wean itself off Russian imports, unplanned outages like the one at Nyhamna can have significant impacts on the region's energy security and price stability.
