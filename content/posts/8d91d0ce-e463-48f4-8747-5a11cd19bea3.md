TerraForm Labs 将支付 45 亿美元来解决证券欺诈案

**Terraform Labs** 同意在曼哈顿联邦法院周三提交的文件中支付巨额 **45亿美元罚款**，以解决证券交易委员会 (SEC) 的欺诈案件。根据该机构提出的解决方案，导致 2022 年 TerraUSD 数字代币 400 亿美元崩盘的公司将被“永远退出业务”。

在纽约陪审团今年 4 月对他们做出不利裁决后，**SEC** 发现 Terraform Labs 及其首席执行官 Do Kwon 应对导致数十亿美元损失的加密货币欺诈负责。作为与 SEC 协议的一部分，Terraform 必须支付 44.7 亿美元的罚款，并被禁止从事加密资产证券交易。

如果法院批准拟议中的判决，Do Kwon 还将被要求支付 **2.04 亿美元**罚款，并被禁止担任任何上市公司高管或董事。 SEC 相信这一解决方案将向参与加密行业不当行为的人发出强烈的威慑信息，强调其管辖范围内所有加密资产必须遵守联邦证券法。

根据拟议中的解决方案，Terraform Labs 必须在其特拉华州单独的 Chapter 11 破产案件中寻求清算计划的批准，并将至少 2.04 亿美元转移到公司的破产财产中以偿还投资者。 SEC 拒绝对法庭文件以外的内容发表评论，而 Terraform Labs 则没有回应评论请求。

根据 SEC 的投诉，在 2018 年 4 月至 2022 年 5 月期间，总部位于新加坡的 Terraform 向投资者筹集了数十亿美元，出售互联数字证券，其中许多证券未正确注册到监管机构。这些资产中包括 Kwon 发明的稳定币 TerraUSD，该币在 2022 年与关联代币 Luna 一起崩盘，导致加密部门出现重大混乱。

Do Kwon 因美国和韩国当局提出的单独刑事指控而被通缉，但目前仍被困在黑山共和国，等待引渡法律战的结果。 Terraform Labs 的案件是针对加密货币行业知名人物采取的一系列高调行动之一，包括 FTX 创始人 Sam Bankman-Fried 和 Binance 创始人 Changpeng Zhao。

 **Terraform Labs** agrees to pay a hefty **$4.5 billion penalty** in an SEC fraud case, as per documents filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday. The company behind the $40bn collapse of TerraUSD digital tokens in 2022 will be put 'out of business for good,' according to the agency's proposed resolution.

The **SEC** found Terraform Labs and its chief executive, Do Kwon, liable for arranging a cryptocurrency fraud that led to billions of dollars in losses after a New York jury ruled against them in April. As part of the agreement with the SEC, Terraform must pay $4.47bn in monetary penalties and is prohibited from engaging in crypto asset securities transactions.

Do Kwon will also be required to pay a penalty of **$204 million** and is banned from serving as an officer or director of any public company if the proposed judgment is approved by the court. The SEC believes that this resolution would send a strong deterrent message to those who engage in misconduct within the crypto industry, emphasizing adherence to federal securities laws for all crypto assets under its purview.

Terraform Labs must seek approval for a liquidation plan as part of its separate Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in Delaware and transfer at least $204 million to the company's bankruptcy estate to repay investors, according to the proposed resolution. The SEC declined to comment beyond court documents, while Terraform Labs did not respond to a request for comment.

Between April 2018 and May 2022, Singapore-based Terraform raised billions of dollars from investors by selling interlinked digital securities, many of which were improperly registered with regulators, according to the SEC's complaint. Among those assets was TerraUSD, a stablecoin invented by Kwon that crashed in 2022 alongside associated token Luna, causing significant disruption within the crypto sector.

Do Kwon is wanted by US and South Korean authorities on separate criminal charges but remains in Montenegro amidst an extradition legal battle. Terraform Labs' case adds to a series of high-profile actions taken against prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry, including FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.
