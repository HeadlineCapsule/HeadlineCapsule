## 特朗普盟友在其前律师科恩的“封口费”证词中表示支持他

在“**封口费**”审判中，**唐纳德·特朗普**在**迈克尔·科恩**提出不利证词时，得到了著名共和党盟友的支持。这场在曼哈顿法庭进行的审判，看到特朗普身边轮流出现潜在的竞选伙伴和竞选助手，包括**众议院议长迈克·约翰逊**、**维韦克·拉马斯瓦米**、**道格·伯古姆**、**拜伦·唐纳兹**和**科里·米尔斯**。尽管法律诉讼限制了他的竞选活动，但特朗普目前在摇摆州的民意调查中领先现任总统**乔·拜登**。特朗普的盟友称这次审判是“骗局”和“虚假”，约翰逊称这是“政治动机”。特朗普的前律师和“解决问题的人”科恩作证说，他曾在 2016 年大选期间策划支付封口费，以掩盖特朗普被指控的不忠行为，包括向色情演员**斯托米·丹尼尔斯**支付 13万美元。特朗普被指控伪造与这些偿还款有关的记录。这次审判引发了不同反应，一些人，如前共和党国会议员**里德·里布尔**，批评特朗普及其盟友参与这一丑闻。

# Trump Allies Flock to His Side for Michael Cohen's 'Hush Money' Testimony 

**Donald Trump** garnered support from prominent Republican allies during the "hush money" trial, as **Michael Cohen**, the prosecution's star witness, delivered damaging testimony. The trial, taking place in a Manhattan courtroom, has seen a rotation of potential running mates and campaign surrogates by Trump's side, including **House Speaker Mike Johnson**, **Vivek Ramaswamy**, **Doug Burgum**, **Byron Donalds**, and **Cory Mills**. Despite the legal proceedings limiting his campaign activities, Trump currently leads incumbent **Joe Biden** in swing state polls. Trump's allies have labeled the trial a "scam" and a "sham", with Johnson calling it "politically motivated". Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testified about orchestrating payments to buy people's silence regarding Trump's alleged infidelities during the 2016 election, including a $130,000 payment to porn actor **Stormy Daniels**. Trump is charged with falsifying records related to these repayments. The trial has sparked mixed reactions, with some, like former GOP congressman **Reid Ribble**, criticizing Trump and his allies for their involvement in the scandal.
