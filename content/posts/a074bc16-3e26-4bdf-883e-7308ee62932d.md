伊朗总统决胜轮：改革派与强硬派对决

# 伊朗总统大选：改革派与强硬派对决

伊朗第二轮总统选举在改革派候选人马苏德·佩泽什基安（Masoud Pezeshkian）和强硬派候选人赛义德·贾利利（Saeed Jalili）之间展开。第一轮选举投票率创纪录地低，只有40%的选民参加投票，这反映了伊朗人因经济困境和社会限制而普遍感到失望。

佩泽什基安承诺改善与西方的关系并放松社会限制，而贾利利则旨在巩固保守派力量并实施更严格的政策。这次选举结果对伊朗至关重要，因为伊朗与西方国家关系紧张，并且正在扩大其核计划。

低投票率在伊朗伊斯兰共和国的政治讨论中占据主导地位，阿亚图拉阿里·哈梅内伊（Ayatollah Ali Khamenei）强调高投票率对于维护伊朗在全球舞台上的稳定和尊严至关重要。选举正值关键时刻，最高领袖的潜在继任问题悬而未决。

改革派希望佩泽什基安的候选人资格将在第二轮选举中动员更多伊朗人参加投票，而贾利利则依靠团结保守派选民支持他这个唯一的强硬派候选人。总统这一角色对外交和国内政策具有重要影响；然而，最终权力掌握在伊朗政治体系中最高领袖和其他未当选的权力中心手中。

 **Summary:**  
Iran's second round presidential election pits reformist Masoud Pezeshkian against hardliner Saeed Jalili. The run-off follows a record low turnout in the first round, with only 40% of voters participating. This situation reflects widespread disillusionment among Iranians due to economic malaise and social restrictions.

Pezeshkian promises improved relations with the West and eased social restrictions, while Jalili aims to consolidate conservative power and enforce stricter policies. The outcome of this election is crucial for Iran's future amidst heightened tensions with Western nations and its nuclear program expansion.

The low turnout has dominated political discourse in the Islamic Republic, as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emphasized that a high voter participation rate was essential to maintaining stability and dignity for Iran on the global stage. The election comes at a critical time with the potential succession of the supreme leader looming.

The reformist camp hopes that Pezeshkian's candidacy will mobilize more Iranians in the run-off, while Jalili relies on uniting conservative voters behind him as the sole hardliner candidate. The presidential role holds significant influence over foreign and domestic policies; however, ultimate authority rests with the supreme leader and other unelected centers of power within Iran's political system.
