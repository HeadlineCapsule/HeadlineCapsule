塔塔钢铁威胁提前关闭波特塔博的炉子，因为罢工。

# 塔塔钢铁威胁提前关闭塔尔伯特港高炉，因罢工在即

英国最大的钢铁生产商塔塔钢铁（Tata Steel）威胁要提前关闭威尔士南部的两个高炉，除非联合工会（Unite union）的工人取消罢工。这个印度拥有的集团在塔尔伯特港运营这些设施，最初计划在6月底关闭其中一个高炉，9月关闭第二个高炉。然而，由于7月8日的罢工即将到来，塔塔钢铁可能出于安全原因，必须从7月1日开始关闭两个高炉，并最晚于7月7日永久性关闭。

塔塔钢铁还对联合工会提起诉讼，质疑罢工投票的有效性。该工会宣布，约1500名工人将从7月8日开始无限期罢工，以抗议塔塔决定今年关闭两个高炉，这将导致多达2800个工作岗位流失，这是政府资助的计划的一部分，旨在减少用工生产。

塔塔钢铁英国公司（Tata Steel UK）首席执行官拉杰什·奈尔（Rajesh Nair）表示，提前关闭两个高炉将对该公司产生“重大影响”，并提出概述免于罢工行动的例外情况，以维持最低水平的服务和支持。联合工会总书记夏隆·格雷厄姆（Sharon Graham）呼吁塔塔印度高管进行谈判，强调工党承诺如果他们在7月4日的下一次大选中获胜，将为该行业争取更好的交易。

工党敦促塔塔钢铁重新考虑一项妥协计划，该计划得到社区工会（Community union）和GMB工会的支持，即在电动弧炉投入运行之前保留其中一个高炉，这可能持续到2030年代初。然而，这项计划将需要超过5亿英镑的纳税人支持，已被塔塔钢铁拒绝，因为它被认为既不可行也负担不起。

 **Tata Steel Threatens Early Closure of Port Talbot Blast Furnaces Amid Strikes**

Britain's largest steel producer, Tata Steel, has threatened to shut down its two blast furnaces in south Wales as early as next week unless workers from the Unite union call off a strike. The Indian-owned group operates these facilities at Port Talbot and had initially planned to close one by June end and the second by September. However, due to the upcoming strike set for July 
8th, Tata Steel may have to begin closing both furnaces from July 1st for safety reasons, with a permanent shutdown no later than July 7th.

Tata Steel has also initiated legal action against Unite, challenging the validity of the strike ballot. The union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike from July 8th to protest Tata's decision to shut both furnaces this year, resulting in up to 2,800 job losses as part of a government-funded plan to shift production using fewer workers.

Rajesh Nair, CEO of Tata Steel UK, stated that closing the two furnaces early would have "major implications" for their company and proposed outline exemptions from strike action to maintain minimum levels of service and support. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham called on Tata executives in India to negotiate, emphasizing Labour's promise to cut a better deal for the industry if they win the upcoming general election on July 4th.

Labour has urged Tata Steel to reconsider a compromise plan backed by Community and GMB unions to retain one of the blast furnaces until an electric arc furnace is operational, which could last into the early 2030s. However, this plan would cost more than £500 million in taxpayer support offered by the Conservative government and has been rejected as neither feasible nor affordable by Tata Steel.
