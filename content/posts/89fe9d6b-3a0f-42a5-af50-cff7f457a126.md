美国将把爱国者防空导弹的订单转给乌克兰

**美国将爱国者防空系统订单转给乌克兰**  
美国决定优先向乌克兰交付爱国者拦截导弹，推迟了向其他国家的运输。这一决定旨在加强乌克兰对俄罗斯袭击的防御能力，并在战争关键时刻维持其库存。在做出这一改变之前，美国总统乔·拜登确保了多个国家承诺向乌克兰提供额外的防空系统。

**要点：**  
- 美国国家安全委员会发言人约翰·柯比确认，将优先向乌克兰交付爱国者和NASAM导弹，预计运输将于夏季晚些时候开始。
- 这一决定是在拜登总统声明确保多个国家承诺向乌克兰提供额外防空系统之后做出的。
- 已经订购了导弹的国家仍会收到它们，但交付时间表可能会因这一决定而推迟。
- 罗马尼亚已决定向乌克兰捐赠一个爱国者系统，意大利计划向基辅发送第二个SAMP/T防空系统。
- 美国制造的爱国者系统包括雷达系统和移动发射器，可以向来袭的弹道导弹或飞机发射拦截导弹。

**对其他国家的影响：**  
已经订购导弹的国家仍会收到它们，但由于这一决定，交付时间可能推迟。罗马尼亚已向乌克兰捐赠了一个爱国者系统，意大利计划发送第二个SAMP/T防空系统。西班牙和希腊拒绝授权向乌克兰转移发射系统，而波兰的爱国者系统已在保护这个饱受战争蹂躏的国家。

**重要性：**  
将爱国者导弹订单转给乌克兰表明了盟友在面临存在威胁时的支持。额外的防空能力将帮助保护乌克兰的城市和平民，以及关键基础设施，如受到俄罗斯袭击的目标——发电设施。

 **US redirects Patriot air defense orders to Ukraine**  
The US has decided to priornize delivering Patriot interceptor missiles to Ukraine, delaying shipments to other nations. This decision aims to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russian attacks and maintain its stockpiles during this critical moment in the war. The shift comes after President Joe Biden secured commitments for additional air defense systems delivery to Ukraine from several countries.

**Key Points:**  
- US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that Patriot and NASAM missile deliveries will be prioritized for Ukraine, with shipments expected to begin in late summer.
- The decision follows President Biden's statement on securing commitments from several nations for additional air defense systems delivery to Ukraine.
- Countries that had already ordered the missiles will receive them but on a delayed timeline.
- Romania has decided to donate one Patriot system to Ukraine, and Italy plans to send Kyiv a second SAMP/T air defense system.
- The US-made Patriot systems consist of radar systems and mobile launchers that can fire interceptor missiles at incoming projectiles or aircraft.

**Impact on Other Countries:**  
Countries with existing orders for the missiles will still receive them, but their delivery timelines may be delayed due to this decision. Romania has donated one Patriot system to Ukraine, and Italy plans to send a second SAMP/T air defense system. Spain and Greece have declined to authorize transfers of launch systems to Ukraine, while Poland's Patriots are already deployed for protecting the war-torn country.

**Importance:**  
The decision to redirect Patriot missile orders is a demonstration of support from partner nations when they face existential danger. The additional air defense capabilities will help protect Ukrainian cities and civilians, as well as critical infrastructure such as power generation facilities that have been targeted by Russian attacks.
