英国媒体所有权法修正案遭遇议会“冲洗”

英国政府未能在议会结束前就媒体所有权法律的关键修正案达成一致，因为选举前的“冲洗”时期，这本可以允许外国国家获得报纸集团的小额股份（预计为amo）。这一变化旨在使主权财富和国家养老基金能够进行较小规模的投资，但并没有被纳入专注于监管大型科技公司的《数字市场、竞争与消费者法案》。

该修正案本应解决议员、上议院议员和报社老板们在里希·苏纳克（Rishi Sunak）政府阻止《电讯报》媒体集团出售给阿联酋支持的RedBird IMI公司后所提出的担忧。人们对5%的股份门槛进行了辩论，因为它可能给英国言论自由和媒体自由带来不适当的影响。

没有这一修正案，国家对报纸集团的所有权实际上被阻止了，这让那些希望吸引中东和海湾地区等现金丰富的国家投资的报社老板们感到担忧。该法律也可能阻止海外公共部门资金的养老基金成为股东。

现在需要在大选后通过次级立法进行修正，咨询期延长至7月9日。下一届政府必须决定是否将门槛设定为5%，或设定为其他水平，或者根本不设定门槛。这一失败不会影响《每日电讯报》、《星期日电讯报》和《旁观者》杂志的出售，因为它很可能在7月4日后结束，许多竞标人将面临竞争和媒体监管机构的审查。

## Summary:
The UK government failed to agree on a crucial amendment to media ownership laws before the end of parliament due to the pre-election "wash-up" period, which would have allowed foreign states to acquire small stakes (expected at amo) in newspaper groups. This change was intended to enable smaller investments from sovereign wealth and state pension funds but did not make it into the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that focuses on Big Tech companies' regulation.

The amendment would have addressed concerns raised by MPs, peers, and newspaper bosses after Rishi Sunak’s government blocked the sale of the Telegraph Media Group to Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI. The 5% stake threshold was debated as it could potentially give undue influence on free expression and media freedom in the UK.

Without this amendment, state ownership of a newspaper group is effectively blocked, which concerns newspaper bosses who want to attract investments from cash-rich states like those in the Middle East and Gulf region. The law may also deter pension funds with overseas public sector money from becoming shareholders.

The amendment will now need to be made through secondary legislation after the general election, with a consultation period extended until July 9th. The next government must decide on setting the threshold at 5%, a different level or not at all. This failure is not expected to affect the sale of The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph titles and Spectator magazine as it will likely conclude after July 4th, with many bidders facing scrutiny from competition and media regulators.

## Interesting Questions:
1. **Q**: What are the potential implications for UK newspapers if foreign states are allowed to acquire small stakes in newspaper groups?  
    **A**: Allowing foreign states to acquire small stakes could lead to increased investment opportunities and financial support from cash-rich countries, particularly those with sovereign wealth funds. This may help UK newspapers remain competitive and financially stable. However, it also raises concerns about potential undue influence on free expression and media freedom in the UK if these foreign states have political or ideological agendas that could impact editorial decisions.
2. **Q**: How might the failure to agree on this amendment before the end of parliament affect future newspaper sales, such as The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph titles?  
    **A**: While the immediate sale of these newspapers is not expected to be affected due to its likely conclusion after July 4th, the lack of an agreed-upon amendment could impact future deals. Potential buyers may face increased scrutiny from competition and media regulators, which might deter some investors or lead to more stringent conditions being imposed on sales agreements.
3. **Q**: What are the potential consequences of not setting a threshold for foreign state ownership in UK newspapers?  
    **A**: Not setting any threshold could result in either no restrictions on foreign state ownership, allowing complete freedom and flexibility for investments from sovereign wealth funds or other sources. However, this may also lead to concerns about the potential influence of these foreign states over editorial decebt and media freedom within the UK. Alternatively, not setting a threshold could mean maintaining the current restrictions on state ownership, which might deter some investors but would ensure greater control over who can acquire stakes in UK newspapers.
