# 英国高级官员：**减少污水污染必须成为英国的“公共卫生优先事项”** 

---
*英格兰首席医疗官克里斯·威蒂（Chris Witty）支持一份倡导减少污水泄漏和提高自来水公司服务报告。近期的饮用水污染事件以及向英格兰最大的湖泊排放未经处理的污水等问题，已经引起了人们对该问题的高度关注。随着人们对海滩**污水污染**的抗议越来越多，政府和自来水公司面临着解决这一问题的日益增长的压力。
皇家工程院（RAE）编写的报告呼吁建立更好的监测和预警系统以跟踪污水情况，并采取措施减少污水的溢流，例如建造储罐以及利用紫外线消毒技术改善废水处理等。**克里斯·威蒂爵士强调**, 即使是经过处理的污水仍可能含有有害的人类细菌和病毒，如果被摄入，可能会对健康造成严重风险。他指出在河流水位较低时需要更好地管理排放经处理过的水, 因为此时人们更倾向于游泳或戏水，这会增加潜在的有害有机物的浓度。
虽然目前缺乏特定污水排放与健康事件之间因果联系的证据，但接触高浓度的粪便造成的健康风险是众所周知的。英国皇家工程院的报告还建议激励房主去除导致污水问题的人工路面, 因为它们增加了管道中的径流水量。随着公众对这一问题关注度的不断提高，“**解决污水污染**”正在成为一项愈发紧迫的环境和公共卫生任务。

# Reducing sewage pollution must be UK 'public health priority', says senior official 

---
**England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Witty**, backs a report advocating for **reductions in sewage spillages and improvements by water companies**. The recent incidents of **drinking water contamination** and the release of raw sewage into England's largest lake have brought the issue to the forefront. With protests arising over **sewage pollution at beaches**, there is increasing pressure on the government and water companies to address the problem.

The report, produced by the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE), calls for better monitoring and warning systems regarding polluted waters as well as implementing measures to reduce sewage overflows such as building storage tanks and improving wastewater treatment with technology like ultraviolet light disinfection. **Sir Chris Whitty emphasizes** that even treated sewage can still contain harmful human bacteria and viruses, presenting a serious health risk if ingested. He highlights the need for better management of treated water releases during low river levels when people are more likely to swim or paddle, as this increases the concentration of potentially harmful organisms. 

While causal links between specific discharges and health incidents may be lacking in evidence currently, the health risks from exposure to high concentrations of faecal matter are well-known. The RAE report also suggests incentivizing homeowners to remove impervious surfaces that contribute to sewage issues by increasing water runoff into pipes. With growing public concern over the issue, addressing **sewage pollution** is becoming an increasingly pressing matter for both environmental and public health reasons.
