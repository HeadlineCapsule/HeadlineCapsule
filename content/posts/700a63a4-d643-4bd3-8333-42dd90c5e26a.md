美国公布限制对华投资的初稿

**美国草案计划**：拜登政府公布了一项旨在限制对中国科技投资的草案计划，尤其是那些被视为安全风险的团体。这一提议是美国持续努力遏制中国军事现代化和保护国家安全利益的一部分。

**要点**：
- 财政部发布了新规则的提案，旨在执行美国总统乔·拜登去年签署的行政命令，针对对中国先进技术的投资。
- 这项法规寻求限制美国技术、资本和专业知识流向与中国中国人民解放军（PLA）合作的团体。
- 草案计划包括对某些投资的直接禁止，并要求美国个人和组织通知政府其他交易。它还考虑了对公开交易证券或基金的可能例外。
- 该法规将影响股权投资、可转换为股权的债务融资、绿地投资和合资企业，但免除了低于一定门槛的有限合伙人（LP）。
- 财政部强调，草案计划侧重于防止美国投资被寻求开发对军事、情报、监视或网络能力至关重要的敏感技术的国家利用，中国被单列出来作为一个“令人担忧的国家”。
- 拜登政府因为没有提议禁止对公开交易证券的投资而受到批评，并继续通过各种措施努力减少来自中国的安全威胁。

 **US Draft Plan**: The Biden administration has unveiled a draft plan aimed at restricting investment in Chinese technology, particularly those groups deemed a security risk. This proposal is part of the US's ongoing efforts to curb China's military modernization and protect national security interests.

**Key Points**:
- The Treasury released proposals for a new rule designed to implement an executive order signed by President Joe Biden last year, targeting investments in Chinese cutting-edge technology.
- This regulation seeks to restrict the flow of US technology, capital, and expertise to groups in China working with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
- The draft plan includes outright bans on certain investments and requires American individuals and organizations to notify the government of other transactions. It also considers possible exceptions for publicly traded securities or funds.
- The regulation would affect equity investments, debt financing convertible to equity, greenfield investments, and joint ventures but exempts limited partners (LP) below a certain threshold.
- The Treasury emphasizes that the draft plan is focused on preventing exploitation of US investment by countries seeking to develop sensitive technologies critical to military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber capabilities posing threats to the US. China is singled out as a "country of concern."
- The Biden administration has faced criticism for not proposing to ban investment in publicly traded securities and continues efforts to reduce security threats from China through various measures.
