欧股所CEO称企业对法国大选不必过于担心

# 欧理博通（Euronext）首席执行官斯蒂芬·布伊纳（Stéphane Boujnah）建议商业领袖们对即将到来的法国大选及其可能结果保持冷静，无论是极右翼的国民联盟（RN）还是左翼的新流行阵线（NFP）上台。他提出，由于评级机构、工会、欧盟压力和总统权力等各种限制，双方都无法完全实施其政策承诺。

RN和NFP提出的政策与埃马纽埃尔·马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）亲商业的立场背道而驰。自马克龙宣布提前大选以来，Cac 40股票指数下跌约5%，法国和德国之间的借贷成本也有所增加。投资者担心RN或NFP上台可能产生的影响，因为双方都提议对税收和公共支出进行重大改革。

布伊纳认为，当面对管理一个国家所带来的复杂性时，双方都需要时间来削弱他们雄心勃勃的计划。他还强调了马克龙亲欧洲联盟和亲商业的方法，表示除了他连任之外，任何其他结果都将不太有利。

NFP概述了今年的支出增加计划，今年将增加250亿欧元，到2027年将达到1500亿欧元。他们声称他们的支出将由计划的税收增加来覆盖，而不会增加法国的预算赤字。RN提议立即采取措施，将燃料和电力的增值税从20%降低到5.5%，预计成本为120亿欧元，同时废除马克龙的养老金改革可以节省约130亿欧元。

 **Summary:**  
Euronext CEO Stéphane Boujnah advises business leaders to remain calm regarding the upcoming French snap elections and potential outcomes involving far-right Rassemblement National (RN) or leftwing Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP). He suggests that neither party would be able to fully implement their policy pledges due to various constraints such as rating agencies, unions, EU pressure, and the president's power.

Both RN and NFP have proposed policies diverging from President Emmanuel Macron'cu pro-business stance. The Cac 40 stock index has fallen about 5%, while borrowing costs between France and Germany have increased since Macron announced the snap elections. Investors are concerned over potential impacts of RN or NFP coming to power, with both parties proposing significant changes in taxes and public spending.

Boujnah believes that it will take time for either party to water down their ambitious plans when faced with the complexities of running a country. He also emphasizes Macron's pro-European Union and pro-business approach, stating that any outcome other than his reelection would be less favorable.

The NFP has outlined plans for increased spending by €25bn this year, with the total reaching €150bn by 2027. They claim their spending will be covered by planned tax increases without increasing France's budget deficit. The RN proposes immediate measures to lower VAT on fuel and electricity from 20% to 5.5%, costing an estimated €12bn, while repealing Macron's pension reform would save around €13bn based on expected savings from the reform.
