橙汁危机促使寻找替代水果

全球橙汁行业正面临着前所未有的危机，因为巴西的橙园受到恶劣天气和疾病的影响，而巴西是全球最大的橙子出口国。橙汁期货价格因这些挑战已达到创纪录的高位。国际果蔬汁协会（IFU）建议由于其对气候变化的耐力，探索用金桔等替代水果制作橙汁。然而，这需要在国际和国家层面进行监管变化。

有趣的问题：

1. **问题：全球橙汁行业如何受到巴西天气状况和疾病的影响？**
答案：该行业正面临着危机，因为恶劣天气、疾病爆发和气候变化导致从巴西的供应减少，从而使橙汁期货价格创纪录地高涨。这种情况促使制造商探索使用金桔等替代水果来维持生产水平。

2. **问题：在使用金桔作为制作橙汁的替代水果时有哪些挑战？**
答案：主要挑战是需要在国际和国家层面进行监管变化，例如修改《食品法典》中的食物标准代码并获得美国食品药品监督管理局等组织的批准。这个过程可能需要时间，并且可能会遇到抵制，因为人们担心如何保持橙汁产品的天然性和形象。

3. **问题：消费者对橙汁的偏好在 COVID-19 大流行期间有何变化，这对该行业有何影响？**
答案：在 COVID-19 大流行期间，一些消费者最初转向维生素 C 补充剂，但后来又重新发现了他们对橙汁的热爱。对橙汁的新发现兴趣增加了全球供应链的压力，因为它已经紧张，并且可能导致价格上涨，因为制造商会将不断上涨的成本转嫁给客户。

附加信息：

- **橙汁期货**：允许行业参与者对冲橙汁市场价格波动风险的合约。
- **柑橘绿化病**：一种由吸食植物汁液的 ψ 类昆虫传播的无法治愈的疾病，会使橙子变苦，并最终杀死树木。这种疾病 20 年前在佛罗里达州的首次发现，此后已蔓延到巴西等其他主要橙子产区。
- **食品法典**：制定食品安全和质量指南的国际食品标准代码。如果使用替代水果制作橙汁，则需要改变这些法规。

**Summary:**  
The global orange juice industry is facing an unprecedented crisis due to bad weather and disease affecting Brazil's orange groves, the world's largest exporter. Orange juice futures have reached record high prices as a result of these challenges. The International Fruit & Vegetable Juice Association (IFU) suggests exploring alternative fruits like mandarins for making orange juice due to their resilience against climate change. However, this would require regulatory changes at both international and national levels.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. **Q: How has the global orange juice industry been impacted by weather conditions and diseases in Brazil?**  
A: The industry is facing a crisis as bad weather, disease outbreaks, and climate change have led to record-high prices for orange juice futures due to reduced supply from Brazil. This situation prompts manufacturers to explore alternative fruits like mandarins to maintain production levels.
2. **Q: What are the challenges in using mandarins as an alternative fruit source for making orange juice?**  
A: The main challenge is that regulatory changes would be required at both international and national levels, such as amending the Codex Alimentarius food standards code and obtaining approval from organizations like the US Food and Drug Administration. This process could take time and may face resistance due to concerns about maintaining the naturalness and image of orange juice products.
3. **Q: How have consumer preferences for orange juice changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what impact does this have on the industry?**  
A: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some consumers rediscovered their love for orange juice after initially switching to vitamin C supplements. This renewed interest in orange juice has put additional pressure on an already strained global supply chain and may contribute to higher prices as manufacturers pass on rising costs to customers.

**Additional Information:**  
- **Orange Juice Futures:** Contracts that allow industry players to hedge against price swings in the orange juice market.
- **Citrus Greening Disease:** An incurable disease spread by sap-sucking psyllid insects, which makes oranges bitter and eventually kills the tree. First detected in Florida 20 years ago, it has since spread to other major orange-producing regions like Brazil.
- **Codex Alimentarius:** An international food standards code that sets guidelines for food safety and quality. Changing these regulations would be necessary if alternative fruits are used for making orange juice.
