欧洲必须采取行动，打破天然气供应的恶性循环。

## 摘要：
文章讨论了欧洲天然气市场在维持稳定方面面临的挑战。自2022年以来，欧盟不得不适应和重组，因为失去了俄罗斯的管道供应，并转向更绿色的替代品。这种转变需要重新思考传输网络策略和用户之间的成本分配。

关键点包括：
- **欧洲天然气市场** 在政治挑战面前的韧性
- 失去俄罗斯管道供应需要重组欧盟系统
- 向更绿色的替代品过渡可能导致维持超大天然气网的成本增加
- 需要一种新的方法来在用户之间分配网络维护成本
- 德国的“存储征收”及其可能在2e05年被废除
- TSOs计划由于失去俄罗斯过境收入而提高费用，影响跨境交易机会
- 可能的解决方案：欧盟支持前俄罗斯过境国，创建由欧盟拥有的“不良TSO”，补贴网络缩减，并为特定管道使用提供关税豁免。

## Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by the European gas market in maintain. The EU has had to adapt and restructure due to the loss of Russian pipeline supply since 2022, as well as transitioning towards greener alternatives. This shift requires a rethinking of transmission network strategies and cost distribution among users.

Key points include:
- **European gas market** resilience amidst political challenges
- Loss of Russian pipeline supply necessitates restructuring the EU system
- Transition to greener alternatives may lead to higher costs for maintaining oversized gas grids
- The need for a new approach in distributing network maintenance costs among users
- Germany's "storage levy" and its potential abolishment by 2e05
- TSOs planning to raise fees due to lost Russian transit revenue, impacting cross-border trading opportunities
- Possible solutions: EU support for former Russian transit countries, creation of an EU-owned "bad TSO", subsidized network downsizing, and exemptions from tariffs for specific pipeline usage.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How has the loss of Russian gas supply impacted Europe's transition to greener alternatives?
   A: The loss of Russian gas supply has forced Europe to reconfigure its energy system around alternative sources, such as floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and renewable energies. This shift requires maintaining oversized gas grids while the demand for gas decreases due to the transition towards greener alternatives. As a result, costs associated with network maintenance are expected to rise in order to sustain Europe's single gas market.
2. Q: What challenges do transmission system operators (TSOs) face as they adapt their revenue models without Russian gas flows?
   A: TSOs must find ways to compensate for the lost transit revenues from Russia, which may involve raising fees for transporting gas through their systems. This could lead to higher costs for shipping gas south and west to central Europe, impact cross-border trading opportunities, and make it more difficult for developing markets like Ukraine to integrate into the European network.
3. Q: What are some potential solutions proposed in the article to address the challenges faced by the European gas market?
   A: The article suggests several possible solutions, including providing support for TSOs in former Russian transit countries, creating an EU-owned "bad TSO" that owns and pays for unneeded capacity, subsidizing network downsizing in areas previously reliant on Russian gas, and offering exemptions from tariffs for companies using new or repurposed pipelines between LNG terminals and landlocked countries. These measures aim to distribute additional costs more effectively while promoting the desired behavior within the European gas market.
