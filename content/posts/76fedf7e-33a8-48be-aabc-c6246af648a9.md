专家称保守党和工党对避税的整顿是一项“艰巨任务”

# 英国保守党和工党承诺打击避税，每年可筹集多达60亿英镑资金，但专家对此持怀疑态度。

**摘要：**

英国保守党和工党都承诺将加强避税问题，并致力于每年筹集高达60亿英镑的资金。然而，这一目标面临着专家的质疑，他们认为这是一个“艰巨的任务”。在过去的18年中，税收差距只略有缩小，这使得实现如此显著的节约变得具有挑战性。专家建议简化税收制度并投资于客户服务，以帮助减少导致税收差距的人为错误。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 专家们为什么认为从应对避税中每年节省60亿英镑是一个挑战？

   答：专家们指出了几个使实现如此显著的节约变得困难的因素，包括实际避税的金额有限（2021-22年估计仅为14亿英镑），非法活动顽固存在，每年向税收差距贡献约110亿英镑，以及人为错误约占总缺口的45%。

2. 专家们如何建议缩小税收差距？

   答：专家们建议简化税收制度，同时投资于客户服务、数字化和教育，作为帮助人们支付正确税额的关键战略。这种方法将解决导致总缺口中很大一部分的人为错误问题。

3. 保守党提出了哪些潜在的资金来源？

   答：保守党计划通过打击避税每年额外筹集60亿英镑资金，其中额外资金来自以前宣布的计划（24亿英镑）和对国家服务基金的贡献（10亿英镑）。他们还打算从“英国共享繁荣基金”中分配15亿英镑，这是一个脱欧后的区域援助计划。

**Summary:**
Tax avoidance crackdown pledges by UK's Conservative and Labour parties aiming to raise up to £6bn annually face skepticism from experts, who deem the goal as "tall order." The tax gap has shifted only slightly over 18 years, making it challenging to achieve such significant savings. Experts suggest that simplifying the tax system and investing in customer service could help reduce errors contributing to the tax gap.

**Interesting Questions:**
Q1: What are some of the main reasons experts believe achieving a £6bn annual saving from tackling tax avoidance is challenging?
A1: Experts cite several factors that make it difficult to achieve such significant savings, including the limited amount of actual tax avoidance (estimated at just £1.4bn for 2021-22), stubborn illegal activities contributing around £11bn annually to the tax gap, and human errors accounting for about 45% of the overall shortfall.

Q2: How do experts suggest reducing the tax gap?
A2: Experts recommend simplifying the tax system while investing in customer service, digitization, and education as key strategies to help people pay the right amount of tax. This approach would address human errors that contribute significantly to the overall shortfall.

Q3: What are some potential sources for funding proposed by the Conservative party?
A3: The Conservative party plans to raise an extra £6bn a year from tackling tax avoidance, with additional funds coming from a previously announced plan (£2.4bn) and contributions towards a national service fund (£1bn). They also intend to allocate £1.5bn from the "UK shared prosperity fund," which is a post-Brexit regional aid scheme.
