# 美国石油业被控合谋，但产量创纪录带来反思

**美国石油产量** 目前每天超过 1300 万桶，打破了 2023 年创下的纪录。尽管产量令人印象深刻，但**美国联邦贸易委员会 (FTC)** 和多名公民指控**美国钻探公司**合谋，通过不当**协调其运营**来维持高油价。这一指控包括一项宣称，即 Pioneer Natural Resources 公司前首席执行官斯科特·谢菲尔德（Scott Sheffield）与**欧佩克**勾结，人为压低产量。这与 2010 年代独立生产商优先考虑市场份额而非现金流的做法形成了鲜明对比，今天的幸存公司则采取了更严格的做法，削减资本支出，转而优先考虑股息和回购。

目前的辩论集中在这些资本配置决策是否合法不竞争，尽管看起来合理，但企业是否有责任优先考虑整个社会的低价格。石油是一种典型的商品，当应对行业产量水平时，公司面临着艰难的选择。亿万富翁**哈罗德·哈姆**（Harold Hamm）将大陆资源公司私有化的行为，进一步说明了复杂的动态变化。

近年来，10 家最大的钻探公司累计净收入超过 3000 亿美元，与该行业的整合增加相吻合，尤其是在**二叠纪盆地**。埃克森美孚收购 Pioneer 以及西方石油公司和雪佛龙公司类似的交易减少了竞争，引发了监管担忧，政界人士也呼吁阻止这些合并。虽然美国人曾经担心依赖“外国石油”，但当前局势凸显出德克萨斯州的生产商主要受资本主义利益的驱动。

# Collusion claims in US oil must reckon with record production

**US oil production** is currently exceeding 13 million barrels per day, surpassing the record set in 2023. Despite this impressive output, the **US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** and several citizens have alleged that **US drillers** are colluding to maintain elevated oil prices by improperly **coordinating their operations**. This accusation includes a claim that Scott Sheffield, the former CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, worked with **OPEC** to keep production artificially low. The behavior of independent producers in the 2010s, who prioritized market share over cash flow, has been contrasted with the more disciplined approach of surviving companies today, who have slashed capital expenditures in favor of dividends and buybacks. 

The current debate centers on whether these capital allocation decisions, though seemingly rational, were legally uncompetitive, and whether businesses have a responsibility to prioritize low prices for society as a whole. Oil is a textbook commodity, and companies face difficult choices in reacting to industry output levels. The actions of billionaire **Harold Hamm**, who took Continental Resources private to gain flexibility in drilling decisions, further illustrate the complex dynamics at play. 

In recent years, the 10 biggest drillers have accumulated net income exceeding $300 billion, coinciding with increased consolidation in the industry, particularly in the **Permian Basin**. The acquisition of Pioneer by Exxon and similar deals by Occidental Petroleum and Chevron have reduced competition, sparking regulatory concerns and calls from politicians to block these mergers. While Americans once feared dependence on "foreign oil," the current situation highlights that Texan producers are driven primarily by capitalist interests.
