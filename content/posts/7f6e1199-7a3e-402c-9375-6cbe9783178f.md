国际货币基金组织警告美国必须“紧急”解决债务负担问题

**国际货币基金组织警告美国必须紧急解决债务负担**

国际货币基金组织（IMF）敦促美国解决其不断增加的财政负担，并在总统候选人首场选举辩论前数小时批评了双方的税收计划。该基金警告称，不断增长的赤字对国内和全球经济都构成越来越大的风险。

根据 IMF 对美国经济的年度第四条咨询报告，债务与 GDP 之比预计将在 2032 年达到 140%，远高于当前 120.7% 的水平。赤字和债务的激增对美国和全球经济都构成了重大风险，可能导致更高的财政融资成本和到期债务展期挑战。

IMF 在国会预算办公室预测美国赤字今年将达到 1.9 万亿美元（约占 GDP 的 10%）之后发出了警告，这一数字高于 2 月份预计的 1.5 万亿美元。经济学家和投资者越来越担心，无论是总统乔·拜登还是他的共和党对手唐纳德·特朗普都没有准备好采取足够措施控制失控的开支。

该基金呼吁双方“仔细考虑”增加税收，包括对年收入低于 40 万美元的人征税。IMF 总裁克里斯塔利娜·乔治娃强调，美国应该在经历强劲增长和有利条件时解决其财政负担。

除了债务问题外，IMF 还承认对中国绿色科技产品的关税和政治上的理由，以及对所有进口商品征收 10% 的统一关税。乔治娃指出，几十年的全球化已经产生了总体积极的结果，但同时也给一些社区带来了负面影响，例如因其他国家廉价进口品而导致的就业机会流失。

 **IMF Warns US Must Urgently Address Debt Burden**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the United States to address its mounting fiscal burden, as it took aim at the tax plans of both presidential candidates just hours before their first electoral debate. The fund warned that rising deficits create a growing risk to the domestic and global economy.

According to the IMF's annual Article IV health check of the US economy, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to hit 140% by 2032, much higher than its current level of 120.7%. This surge in deficits and debt poses a significant risk to both the United States and global economies, potentially leading to higher fiscal financing costs and challenges with rolling over maturing obligations.

The IMF's warnings come after the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the US deficit would reach $1.9tn this year or about amo of GDP, up from a February estimate of $1.5tn. Economists and investors have grown increasingly concerned that neither President Joe Biden nor his Republican rival Donald Trump are prepared to do enough to bring rampant spending under control.

The fund has called on both candidates to "carefully consider" tax increases, including on incomes for those earning under $400,000 a year. The IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva emphasized that the United States should address its fiscal burden while experiencing strong growth and favorable conditions.

In addition to debt concerns, the IMF also acknowledged political cases for tariffs on Chinese green tech products and a blanket 10% levy on all imports. Georgieva noted that decades of globalization have led to overall positive outcomes but negative consequences for some communities in terms of job losses due to cheap imports from other countries.
