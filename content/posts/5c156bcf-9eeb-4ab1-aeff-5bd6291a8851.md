富国银行解雇员工，因为他们“模拟”在键盘上工作

**富国银行** 最近因指控几名员工试图欺骗他们的经理，让他们相信他们在工作，而实际上没有工作，而被解雇。这一事件是混合工作安排时代整顿不遵守规则员工的最新迹象。

该**银行** 在上个月确定这些员工试图通过模拟键盘活动来“创造积极工作的印象”后，根据美国证券行业顶级监管机构金融业监管局 (Finra) 的监管文件，解雇了这些员工。受影响的员工主要来自银行的投资和财富管理部门，包括新近被聘用的员工和长期在职员工。

针对这些事件，富国银行强调了其对维护所有员工高标准的承诺，以及对不道德行为的不容忍态度。 discharged 员工使用的具体技术在文件中仍未披露，这些文件是由彭博社首先报道的。

整顿不遵守规则的员工与 Finra 最近恢复在疫情期间暂停的工作场所规则同时发生。这些法规要求更密切地监督管理人员的工作设置，并可能需要检查员工的家庭办公室，从而使他们更难继续采用混合工作安排。

富国银行是疫情期间对大多数员工实施三天的办公室工作要求的银行之一。然而，随着大型金融公司继续保持混合工作安排（根据 Scoop 之前的一项调查，为 82%），一些机构现在正在加大努力，以确保遵守工作场所规则和法规。

其他银行，例如美国银行、高盛、巴克莱银行和花旗集团，在过去几个月中也采取了措施，以执行更严格的办公室出勤政策或更密切地监控员工行为。

 **Wells Fargo** has recently fired several employees due to allegations of attempting to deceive their managers into believing they were working when, in fact, they were not. This incident is the latest indication of a crackdown on non-compliant staff during the era of hybrid work arrangements.

The **bank** discharged these workers last month after determining that they had tried to "create the impression of active work" through simulating keyboard activity, as stated in regulatory filings with Finra, a top US securities industry regulator. The affected employees were primarily from the bank's investment and wealth management divisions, including both recent hires and long-term staff members.

In response to these events, Wells Fargo emphasized its commitment to maintaining high standards for all employees and intolerance towards unethical behavior. The specific techniques used by the discharged workers remain undisclosed in the filings, which were first reported by Bloomberg.

This crackdown on non-compliant staff coincides with Finra's recent reinstatement of workplace rules that had been suspended during the pandemic. These regulations require closer supervision of managers' working setups and may necessitate inspections of employees' home offices, potentially making it more challenging for them to continue hybrid work arrangements.

Wells Fargo was one of the banks that embraced a three-day in-office requirement for most employees during the pandemic. However, as large financial companies have continued to retain hybrid work arrangements (82% according to an earlier survey by Scoop), some institutions are now increasing their efforts to ensure compliance with workplace rules and regulations.

Other banks such as Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, and Citigroup have also taken measures in recent months to enforce stricter office attendance policies or monitor employee behavior more closely.
