塞科面临着里程碑式的股东诉讼，因为过度收费丑闻

# 里程碑式的股东诉讼：Serco 电子监控合同丑闻

包括安联集团和罗素投资公司在内的多家机构投资者即将与 **Serco** 公司进行一场里程碑式的股东诉讼，起因是该公司在电子监控合同一事上的造假丑闻。该案将于周一（伦敦）高等法院开庭审理，这可能是英国首次出现的同类美国风格的证券诉讼。

投资者声称，由于 Serco 在年度报告中存在“误导性或不实陈述和遗漏”，导致他们遭受了损失。此前，Serco 公司向英国政府多收费数十百万英镑的电子监控服务费用，这一丑闻导致了 **严重欺诈办公室 (SFO)** 的调查。SFO 于 2019 年对 Serco 处以 1920 万英镑的罚款（另加费用），并在 2021 年对两名前高管进行了起诉，但最终案件在陪审团审判中失败。

如果该案进入庭审程序，它将为未来的证券诉讼案件建立重要的法律先例，影响其他英国公司如 Glencore、巴克莱银行和 BT 公司。Serco 表示将坚决否认这些指控，声称被质疑的陈述与投资者损失之间没有因果关系。

该案的判决结果可能在英国管辖范围内标志着证券诉讼案件的一个转折点，因为它可以帮助确定其他类似案件成功的可能性。

 # Article Summary: Landmark Shareholder Lawsuit Against Serco Over Mischarging Scandal

A group of institutional investors, including Allianz and Russell Investments, are set to face off against **Serco** in a landmark shareholder lawsuit over an electronic tagging contract scandal. The case is scheduled for trial at the High Court in London on Monday and could be the first US-style securities litigation of its kind in England.

The investors claim to have suffered losses due to "misleading or untrue statements and omissions" in Serco's annual reports, as a result of the company overcharging the UK government for electronic tagging services by tens of millions of pounds. The scandal led to an investigation by the **Serious Fraud Office (SFO)**, which fined Serco £19.2mn plus costs in 2019 and prosecuted two former executives during a jury trial that ultimately collapsed in 2021.

If the case proceeds to trial, it could establish important legal precedent for future securities litigation claims against other UK companies such as Glencore, Barclays, and BT. Serco has stated its intention to robustly defend itself against these allegations, claiming that there is no causal link between the statements in question and investor losses.

The outcome of this case could potentially mark a turning point for securities litigation claims within the UK jurisdiction, as it may help determine the prospects of success for other similar cases.
