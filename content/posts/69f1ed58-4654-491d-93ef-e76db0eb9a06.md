# “咆哮的凯蒂”的迷因股票投资者无法拯救 AMC

以 **"Roaring Kitty"** 又名 **"Keith Gill"** 为首的**迷因股票**投资者，尽管 **AMC Entertainment** 公司即将进行**债务重组**，并可能**抹去现有股票价值**，但该公司股价却飙升。吉尔在休整后的回归引发了 **GameStop** 和 AMC 股票的飙升，其中 AMC 股价从每股 3 美元飙升至 10 美元。AMC 顺应迷因股票现象，自 2021 年起通过向零售投资者出售股票筹集了 30 亿美元。然而，该公司财务状况严峻，市值不到 10 亿美元，而债务和租赁义务超过 80 亿美元。行业出版物显示，随着 2026 年到期日的临近，**债权人**正在组织起来。AMC 的年度报告承认其现金流消耗速度不可持续，并寄希望于票房恢复到 2019 年的水平，但行业专家认为这不太可能。虽然 AMC 的贷款方和债券持有人从现金注入中受益，但他们最终会期待作为所有者来对待，这标志着由社区驱动的迷因股票动态发生了转变。

# Roaring Kitty's Meme Stock Investors Can't Save AMC 

**Meme stock** investors, led by "Roaring Kitty," aka **Keith Gill**, sent shares of **AMC Entertainment** soaring, despite the company's impending **debt restructuring** that is likely to **wipe out existing equity value**. Gill's return after a hiatus sparked a rally in **GameStop** and AMC stocks, with the latter surging from $3 to $10 per share. AMC, embracing the meme stock phenomenon, has raised $3 billion since 2021 by selling stock to retail investors. However, the company's financial reality is stark, with a market cap of less than $1 billion and over $8 billion in debt and lease obligations. Trade publications indicate that **creditors** are organizing as maturities loom in 2026. AMC's annual report acknowledges the unsustainability of its cash burn rates and pins its hopes on a box office recovery to 2019 levels, which industry experts deem unlikely. While AMC's lenders and bondholders benefit from the cash infusion, they will eventually expect to be treated as owners, marking a shift in the community-driven meme stock dynamic.
