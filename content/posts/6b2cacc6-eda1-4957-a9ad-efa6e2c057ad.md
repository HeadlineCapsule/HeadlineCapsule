TikTok儿童隐私投诉被转交美国司法部

# 抖音面临儿童隐私投诉，被转交美国司法部处理

**联邦贸易委员会（FTC）** 将针对中国视频应用程序 **TikTok** 及其母公司 **字节跳动** 的投诉转交美国司法部处理。指控涉及潜在的违反儿童隐私法行为，包括《儿童在线隐私保护法》（COPPA）。

## 要点：
- FTC 声称 TikTok "正在或即将" 违反 COPPA 和 **FTC Act**。
- 由于有理由相信 TikTok 的做法是不公平或具有误导性的，该投诉被转交美国司法部进一步采取行动。
- 这一最新进展加剧了 TikTok 在全球面临的隐私和安全审查。

## 背景：
FTC 多年前开始调查 TikTok，原因是有可能违反了 online 儿童隐私法。2019 年，TikTok 因非法收集儿童数据而被 FTC 罚款 570 万美元。在审查其遵守该和解协议的情况后，进一步对该公司展开了调查。

## 最近的发展：
- 2021 年 4 月，美国总统乔·拜登签署了一项法律，要求 TikTok 在 2025 年 1 月之前从字节跳动剥离，否则将面临全国性禁令，因为人们担心数据被用于间谍活动和宣传。
- TikTok 对美国政府提起诉讼，声称新法律违宪，侵犯了第一修正案的言论自由权利。有关此事的听证会定于 2021 年 9 月举行。

## TikTok 的回应：
对于 FTC 的指控和投诉转交司法部处理一事，TikTok 表示失望，认为不应通过诉讼来解决问题，而是应努力寻找合理的解决方案。该公司声称已与 FTC 合作一年多，不同意该机构的许多指控，称这些指控在事实上是不准确的，或者已经得到解决。TikTok 强调了其对儿童隐私的承诺，并提到其采取了严格的保障措施，例如从其平台上删除未成年用户。

## 结论：
FTC 将投诉转交司法部处理，突显了人们对 TikTok 违反儿童隐私的持续担忧。随着调查继续进行和法律斗争展开，TikTok 和其母公司字节跳动将如何发展仍需观察。

 # TikTok Faces Child Privacy Complaint Referred to US Justice Department

The **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** has referred a complaint against Chinese video app **TikTok** and its parent company **ByteDance** to the United States justice department. The allegations involve potential violations of child privacy laws, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## Key Points:
- FTC claims TikTok is "violating or about to violate" COPPA and the **FTC Act**.
- The complaint was referred for further action by the US justice department, as it found reason to believe that TikTok's practices are unfair or deceptive.
- This latest development adds to the scrutiny faced by TikTok over privacy and security concerns globally.

## Background:
The FTC began investigating TikTok several years ago for possible violations of laws governing online child privacy. In 201n, TikTok was fined $5.7 million by the FTC for illegally collecting children's data. Following a review of its compliance with that settlement, further investigations into the company were initiated.

## Recent Developments:
- In April 2021, US President Joe Biden signed a law requiring TikTok to divest from ByteDance by January 2025 or face a countrywide ban due to concerns over data usage for espionage and propaganda.
- TikTok has filed a lawsuit against the US government claiming that the new law is unconstitutional, breaching First Amendment free speech rights. A hearing on this matter is scheduled for September 2021.

## Response from TikTok:
In response to the FTC's allegations and referral of the complaint, TikTok expressed disappointment in pursuing litigation instead of working towards a reasonable solution. The company claims that it has been cooperating with the FTC for over a year and disagrees with many of the agency's allegations, stating they are factually inaccurate or have already been addressed. TikTok emphasizes its commitment to child privacy and mentions having stringent safeguards in place, such as removing underage users from their platform.

## Conclusion:
The FTC's referral of the complaint against TikTok highlights ongoing concerns over child privacy violations by the popular video app. As investigations continue and legal battles ensue, it remains to be seen how this situation will unfold for both TikTok and its parent company ByteDance.
