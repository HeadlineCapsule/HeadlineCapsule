中国铜供应过剩增多，经济疲软迹象显现

# 中文铜供应过剩信号经济疲软

这篇文章讨论了上海仓库铜储备的显著增加，达到2020年以来的最高水平。这种积累归因于消费者需求疲软和制造商由于经济状况不佳而减少的购买。当前的情况突出了几个关键点：

1. **铜储备** 位于上海期货交易所仓库中的数量本月已达到约33万吨，为2020年以来的最高水平，与2015年的水平相当。
2. 铜供大于求是由于制造商因需求疲软和高全球价格（由美国领导的投机交易狂热所造成）而减少购买造成的。
3. 铜的主要用途包括建筑项目中的电线、管道和家用电器。这种积累表明，在中国房地产市场下滑和制造业活动疲软的背景下，中国的工业部门处于脆弱状态。
4. 分析师认为，鉴于目前的需求水平和高全球价格，铜制造商有动力减少储备而不是从市场上购买更多。
5. 库存的增加反映了中国房地产市场的下滑、制造业活动和信贷活动疲软，因为北京避免直接刺激家庭消费。
6. 由于中国需求疲软，铜价自上月创纪录的高位11,000美元/吨下跌了13%。库存通常在年初的几个月中积累，但这次比往常持续时间更长。
7. 全球铜储备危险地低，只有几天的消费量作为备用，这可能会导致价格波动。
8. 文章指出，中国铜加工企业最近开始再次购买，导致过去两周库存略有下降。
9. 全球供应过剩正在扰乱该行业，印度尼西亚、印度和刚果民主共和国即将增加大量的冶炼产能。
10. 分析师预计将出现金属短缺，因为巴拿马矿山关闭，主要采矿公司削减产量；然而，由于刚果民主共和国的产量增加和中国加工更多的废料，这种情况并没有发生。
11. 一些分析师认为，由于压抑的需求，铜价可能在今年下半年上涨；而其他人则警告说，如果基金开始对金属进行空头操作，价格可能会进一步下跌。

 # Summary of Article: Chinese Copper Glut Signals Sluggish Economy

The article discusses a significant increase in copper stockpiles within Shanghai warehouses, reaching the highest level since 2020. This build-up is attributed to sluggish consumer demand and manufacturers' reduced purchasing due to tepid economic conditions. The current situation highlights several key points:

1. **Copper stockpiles** in Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses have reached approximately 330,000 tonnes this month, the highest since 2e20 and comparable to levels seen in 2015.
2. The excess copper supply is a result of manufacturers pulling back on buying due to weak demand and high global prices caused by speculative trading frenzy led by the US.
3. Copper's primary uses include electrical wirings, plumbing, and household appliances in construction projects. The build-up indicates a fragile state of China's industrial sector amidst real estate downturn and sluggish manufacturing activity.
4. Analysts suggest that copper manufacturers have an incentive to reduce their stockpiles rather than purchasing more from the market, given current demand levels and high global prices.
5. The rise in inventories reflects China's real estate downturn, sluggish manufacturing, and credit activity as Beijing avoids directly stimulating household consumption.
6. Copper has fallen 13% since its record high of $11,000 per tonne last month due to weak Chinese demand. Inventories usually build up in the first few months of the year but have continued longer than usual this time.
7. Global copper inventories remain dangerously low with only several days' worth of consumption in backup, creating a risk for volatile price surges.
8. The article notes that Chinese copper fabricators have recently started buying again, leading to slight decreases in inventories over the past two weeks.
9. A global oversupply of smelters is causing upheaval within the sector, with Indonesia, India, and the Democratic Republic of Congo set to add significant smelting capacity soon.
10. The closure of a Panama mine and production cuts by major mining companies led analysts to expect metal shortages; however, these did not materialize due to increased output in DRC mines and China's processing of more scrap.
11. Some analysts argue that the copper price could rally in the second half of the year as a result of pent-up demand, while others warn of potential further declines if funds start shorting on the metal.
