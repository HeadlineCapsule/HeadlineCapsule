# **Airbnb** 在复活节提前带来利润跳涨后警惕放缓 

**Airbnb** 报告第一季度利润显著增长，主要原因是复活节提前和成本削减措施。净收入翻了一番多，达到 2.64 亿美元，远超分析师预期。收入 21.4 亿美元，也高于预期。然而，该公司预计第二季度收入增长将显著放缓，预计仅增长 8-10%。这一放缓受复活节假期提前、闰年和不利汇率变动等因素影响。 

总部位于旧金山的 **Airbnb** 公司股价在今年大幅上涨后，盘后交易下跌 7%。**Airbnb** 仍专注于提升其核心租赁业务，拓展新市场，强调在目前 **Airbnb** 业务存在有限的国家存在增长潜力。该公司还强调了其为改善用户体验所做的努力，移除了数千条低质量房源并引入了新功能。 

展望未来，**Airbnb** 预计年中增长将反弹，得益于强劲的预订积压，包括巴黎奥运会等重大活动。虽然第一季度总预订量增长了 12%，但该公司预计第二季度调整后的 **EBITDA** 将基本持平，未达到分析师的估计。**Airbnb** 继续积极回购股份，回购计划中仍有 60 亿美元。

# Airbnb wary of slowdown after early Easter sparks jump in profits 

**Airbnb** reported a significant surge in first-quarter profits, primarily attributed to the early timing of Easter and cost-saving measures. Net income more than doubled, reaching $264 million, far exceeding analyst expectations. Revenue also beat forecasts, totaling $2.14 billion. However, the company forecasts a notable slowdown in revenue growth for the second quarter, expecting an increase of only 8-10%. This deceleration is influenced by factors such as the early Easter holiday, the leap year, and unfavorable currency movements. 

/n/n

Shares of the San Francisco-based company, which have enjoyed a robust rise this year, fell 7% in after-hours trading. **Airbnb** remains focused on enhancing its core rentals business and expanding into new markets, emphasizing the potential for growth in countries with limited current **Airbnb** presence. The company also highlighted its efforts to improve the user experience, removing thousands of low-quality listings and introducing new features. 

/n/n

Looking ahead, **Airbnb** anticipates a rebound in growth during the middle of the year, supported by a strong backlog of bookings, including for notable events such as the Paris Olympics. While gross bookings rose 12% in the first quarter, the company projects adjusted **EBITDA** to remain relatively unchanged for the second quarter, falling short of analyst estimates. **Airbnb** continues to actively repurchase shares, with $6 billion remaining in its buyback program.
