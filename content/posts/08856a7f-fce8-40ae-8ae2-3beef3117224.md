# 中国出口恢复增长，政府优先发展高科技制造业

今年**4 月**，中国**贸易表现**有所回升，在**3 月**出现**逆差**后，**4 月**又恢复**顺差**。**习近平政府**一直专注于发展**高科技制造业**以应对经济挑战，尽管美国和欧洲指责中国“倾销”。这一战略似乎正在奏效，**4 月**的**出口**增长 1.5%，**进口**激增 8.4%，超出了预期。 

中国**第一季度**的整体**GDP 增长率**保持在 5.3%，2024 年全年的目标为 5%，分析人士认为这一目标雄心勃勃。政府对工业和消费者的支持，包括一项“升级”计划，可能促进了积极的贸易数字。然而，经济学家呼吁采取更多提振信心的措施来鼓励支出。 

该国的贸易行为招致批评，被指过量供应并扭曲全球市场。但中国官员为自己的政策辩护，认为他们的出口对世界有益，尤其是在通货膨胀时期和清洁能源转型阶段。

# China's exports return to growth as Beijing prioritizes high-tech manufacturing

China's **trade performance** rebounded in April, with a **surplus** recorded after a **deficit** in March. **Xi Jinping's administration** has focused on **high-tech manufacturing** to counter economic challenges, despite accusations of "dumping" from the US and Europe. This strategy seems to be paying off, with **exports** up 1.5% and **imports** surging 8.4% in April, beating expectations.

China's overall **GDP growth** remains modest at 5.3% for Q1, with a 5% target for 2024, which analysts deem ambitious. The government's support for industry and consumers, including an "upgrade" program, has likely contributed to the positive trade figures. However, economists call for more confidence-boosting measures to encourage spending.

The country's trade practices have drawn criticism, with claims of creating excess supply and distorting global markets. Chinese officials, however, defend their policies, arguing their exports benefit the world, especially in inflationary times and the clean energy transition.
