埃克森问题困扰着雪佛兰对赫斯的收购

# 简讯

本文重点介绍了雪佛龙和赫斯之间可能达成的交易，但埃克森可能会因对赫斯的任何未来并购交易拥有优先拒绝权而阻止该交易。由于埃克森面临其股东对其法律部门针对一家专注于可持续发展的对冲基金所采取的行动的投票，情况变得复杂。

The article highlights a potential deal between Chevron and Hess, with Exxon potentially blocking it due to its right of first refusal on any future M&A deals involving Hess.

In other news, Tesla investors are closely watching Elon Musk as he seeks to secure additional shares worth about $50 billion at the company's upcoming annual meeting.
