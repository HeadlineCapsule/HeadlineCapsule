# 日本美妆品牌需要放眼中国以外的市场

**日本美妆产品公司**曾经是投资者的稳妥选择，但如今面临着挑战：股市表现不佳，并且面临寻找新增长渠道的压力。该行业的**稳定增长和高利润**舒适区已被打破，**资生堂**和**花王**等公司股价和收益分别在过去一年中大幅下跌。关键问题在于对于这些日本公司至关重要的**中国市场**。中国市场是**资生堂最大的市场**，占其总销售额的**24%**。然而，中国疫情后经济复苏缓慢，**青年失业率**居高不下，影响了消费者支出。**化妆品**往往是消费者首先削减的开支，日本品牌正在失去市场份额，而市场份额被**中国本土美妆品牌**抢占，后者目前约占当地市场的一半。由于日本排放核反应堆废水决定，中国消费者对此发起抵制，使得情况进一步恶化。为了长期复苏，日本美妆集团需要多元化发展，不仅限于中国市场，并扩大其国际影响力，特别是在美洲等地区。然而，在美妆行业建立全球影响力是一项艰巨的任务。

# Japanese Beauty Needs to Look Beyond China 

**Japanese beauty product companies**, once a sure bet for investors, are now facing challenges, with underperformance in the stock market and activist pressure to find new growth avenues. The sector's comfort zone of **stable growth and high margins** has been disrupted, and companies like **Shiseido** and **Kao** have seen significant drops in share prices and earnings, respectively, in the past year. The key issue lies in the **Chinese market**, which is vital for these Japanese groups, as it is the **largest market for Shiseido, accounting for 24% of its total sales**. However, the post-pandemic economic recovery in China has been slow, and **youth unemployment** remains high, impacting consumer spending. **Make-up** is often the first to be cut from shopping lists, and Japanese brands are losing market share to **homegrown Chinese beauty brands**, which now account for about half of the local market. The situation is further exacerbated by Chinese boycotts due to Japan's nuclear reactor wastewater discharge decision. To make a long-term recovery, Japanese beauty groups need to diversify beyond China and expand their international presence, particularly in regions like the Americas. However, establishing a global presence in the beauty industry is a challenging task.
