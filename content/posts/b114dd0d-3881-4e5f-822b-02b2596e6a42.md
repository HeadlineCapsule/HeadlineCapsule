琳达·雅卡里诺（Linda Yaccarino）在埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）施压削减成本的背景下对X进行整顿

**文章摘要：** Linda Yaccarino 在努力改善 X 的财务状况并提高销售额的同时削减成本，面临着伊隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 的压力。自一年前被任命为首席执行官以来，两人之间的紧张关系一直在上升。最近，Yaccarino 因为其副手 Joe Benarroch 在处理 X 新的成人内容政策发布时表现不佳而将其解雇，Benarroch 负责业务运营和通信。Nick Pickles 暂时承担了 Benarroch 的职责，扩大了他作为全球政府事务主管的角色，包括指导所有全球通信。

Yaccarino 受到马斯克的压力，要求她增加收入并降低费用，这导致她削减了美国和英国销售团队的人员，并减少了旅行等支出的支出。史蒂夫·戴维斯 (Steve Davis) 是马斯克长期以来的盟友，他被马斯克引入审查 X 的财务状况和绩效管理，一些人猜测他在马斯克收购 X 后可能被视为首席执行官职位的人选。

本周在戛纳，Yaccarino 和马斯克一直在试图吸引广告机构和品牌老板回归该平台，他们之前由于对内容审核、马斯克的管理风格和挑衅性帖子的担忧而从该平台撤回了支出。 X 的高管们声称，在过去的几个月里，有 60% 以上的品牌以小规模的方式恢复了广告。

 **Article Summary:** Linda Yaccarino faces pressure from Elon Musk as she attempts to improve X's financial health and boost sales while cutting costs. Tensions between the two have been rising since her appointment as chief executive a year ago. Recently, Yaccarino fired Joe Benarroch, her right-hand man responsible for business operations and communications, due to his mishandling of X's new adult content policy rollout. Nick Pickles has taken over Benarroch's responsibilities temporarily, expanding his role as global government affairs head to include directing all global communications.

Yaccarino is under pressure from Musk to raise revenues and lower expenses, leading her to cut staff in the US and UK sales teams and reduce spending on items such as travel. Steve Davis, a long-standing ally of Musk, has been brought in by him to review X's finances and performance management, with some speculating that he may be considered for the chief executive position after Musk purchased X.

In Cannes this week, Yaccarino and Musk have been attempting to woo back ad agency and brand bosses who had previously pulled spending from the platform due to concerns about content moderation, Musk's leadership style, and provocative posts. Executives at X claim that more than 60% of brands that paused advertising have resumed in small ways over the past few months.
