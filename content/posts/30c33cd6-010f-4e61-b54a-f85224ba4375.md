# 德国另择党图林根州领袖因故意使用纳粹口号被判罚

**德国另类选择党**（**AfD**）的杰出成员及其**图林根州**领袖 **比约恩·霍克** （Björn Höcke）因**故意使用纳粹禁用口号**而被罚款**1.3万欧元**。位于哈勒的法院裁定霍克在2021年的演讲中使用了纳粹准军事组织“**冲锋队**”的语言，犯下了煽动罪。这起事件是霍克一系列争议言论和纳粹立场中的最新一起，尽管如此，他仍是AfD党内颇具影响力的人物，也是9月图林根州总理选举中的领先候选人。

霍克在梅泽堡的演讲结尾使用了“**一切为了德国**！”这一短语，法官裁定这与冲锋队的集会口号有**故意关联**。尽管霍克声称自己不知情，检察官却提供了他反复使用此类短语的证据，并指出他试图使纳粹语言正常化。法院没有施加更严厉的惩罚，但后续法律谈判将确定霍克是否会留下犯罪记录。

目前，德国国内情报机构正加强审查AfD党，并将其归类为“**疑似右翼极端主义组织**”，这起定罪事件就发生在这个节骨眼上。霍克所在的图林根州AfD党支部已在此分类之下，受到大量监控。该党继续获得支持，尤其是在图林根、萨克森和勃兰登堡等州，在那里，他们有望在即将举行的地方选举中获得更多选票。然而，最近的一系列争议，包括与民族民族主义思想家有联系以及间谍丑闻，也引发了针对AfD的广泛抗议。

霍克和其他AfD政治家声称，他们因政治观点而受到不公平对待，这引起了德国民众对政府处理经济问题不满的共鸣。罚款和潜在的犯罪记录是德国在努力维护其《宪法》对纳粹宣传和标志禁令方面的重要进展，对极端主义意识形态正常化发出了强烈信号。

# AfD leader in Thuringia convicted of deliberately using Nazi slogan 

**Björn Höcke**, a prominent member of the **Alternative for Germany** **(AfD)** party and its leader in the state of Thuringia, has been **fined €13,000** for **intentionally using a banned Nazi slogan**. The ruling, made by a court in Halle, found Höcke guilty of invoking the language of the Nazi paramilitary group, the **storm troopers**, in a 2021 speech. This incident adds to a series of controversies surrounding Höcke's views and his stance towards Nazism, yet he remains a influential figure within the AfD and is a leading candidate to become Thuringia's prime minister in the upcoming September elections. 

Höcke's speech in Merseburg ended with the phrase "Everything for Germany!", which judges ruled was a **deliberate reference** to the storm troopers' rallying cry. Despite Höcke's claims of ignorance, prosecutors presented evidence of his repeated use of such phrases, arguing that he sought to normalize Nazi language. The court stopped short of imposing a harsher penalty, but further legal negotiations will determine whether Höcke will receive a criminal record. 

This conviction comes at a time when the AfD is facing increased scrutiny and classification as a "suspected right-wing extremist organization" by Germany's domestic intelligence service. Höcke's branch of the AfD in Thuringia already falls under this classification, allowing for extensive surveillance. The party continues to gain support, particularly in states like Thuringia, Saxony, and Brandenburg, where they are expected to make gains in the upcoming state elections. However, recent controversies, including ties to ethno-nationalist ideologues and spying scandals, have also led to widespread protests against the AfD. 

Höcke and other AfD politicians claim that they are being unfairly targeted for their views, a sentiment that has resonated with Germans critical of the government's handling of economic issues. The fine and potential criminal record serve as a significant development in Germany's efforts to uphold its constitutional ban on Nazi propaganda and symbols, sending a strong message against the normalization of extremist ideologies.
