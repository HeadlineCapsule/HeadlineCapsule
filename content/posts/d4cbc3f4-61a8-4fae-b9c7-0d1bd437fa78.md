峰会支持乌克兰领土完整，但有些国家弃权

# 乌克兰和平峰会：80个国家支持联合声明，但印度等大国未签署

在瑞士举行的“乌克兰和平峰会”上，92个与会的国家中，有80个国家赞同一份联合声明，支持乌克兰的领土完整及其和平愿景，以解决与俄罗斯的冲突。该文件还背书了乌克兰之前发表的10点和平计划中的三点，旨在吸引尚未支持基辅的发展中国家。

然而，印度、巴西、南非、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国等大国没有签署这份文件，反映出俄罗斯在国际经济和影响力方面仍然具有重要力量。值得注意的是，俄罗斯和中国缺席了这次会议，而中国是俄罗斯战争经济的重要支持者。

乌克兰总统泽连斯基在峰会上强调，“没有领土完整就不会有持久的和平。”俄罗斯总统普京在峰会前夕提出了结束战争的条件，但乌克兰立即拒绝了这些条件。联合声明呼吁在乌克兰控制下的扎波罗热核电站安全运行和战俘的全面交换。

乌克兰打算在第二次也是最后一次峰会上提出其剩余的七点计划，希望俄罗斯的参与表明他们渴望和平。爱沙尼亚总理卡雅·卡拉斯警告不要忘记过去与乌克兰达成的协议中关于主权和领土完整联合国宪章原则。

俄罗斯安全委员会副手德米特里·梅德韦杰夫则贬低这次峰会是“令人沮丧的闹剧”。

 **Summary:**  
The "Summit on Peace in Ukraine" held in Switzerland saw 80 out of 92 attending countries endorse a joint statement supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and part of its peace vision to resolve the conflict with Russia. The document also backed three points from Ukraine’s previously published 10-point peace plan, aiming to appeal to developing nations that have not yet supported Kyiv.

However, major nations such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates abstained from signing up for the document, reflecting Russia's continuing international economic power and influence. Notably absent were Russia itself and China, which is a key backer of Russia’s war economy.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that there would be "no lasting peace without territorial integrity" during the summit. Russian President Vladimir Putin had set out conditions for ending the war on the eve of the summit, which Ukraine immediately rejected. The joint statement called for safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant under Ukrainian control and a full exchange of prisoners of war.

Ukraine intends to present its remaining seven points at a second and final summit, hoping that Russia's participation would indicate their desire for peace. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas cautioned against forgetting UN charter principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity in past agreements with Ukraine.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy on Russia’s security council, dismissed the summit as a "depressing shitshow."
