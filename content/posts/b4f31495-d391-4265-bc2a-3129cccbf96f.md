软银合资企业数据泄露引发日韩互指责

**日本和韩国之间的数据泄露事件引发了指责与反指责**

日本软银公司（SoftBank Corp.）和韩国Naver共同成立的200亿美元互联网公司发生了一系列数据泄露事件，这加剧了两国盟友之间的紧张关系，突显了政府对数字安全的担忧，可能会限制科技集团的国际雄心。该合资企业Line Yahoo经历了网络入侵，其原因被归咎于总部位于首尔的Naver（其联合所有者）不安全的系统。

自数据泄露事件发生以来，日本和韩国一直关系紧张。日本官员认为，出于安全考虑，Naver应该削减其在A Holdings（Line和Yahoo Japan的控股公司）的股份。这将给软银公司（另一家联合所有者）一个机会来夺取控制权。

该事件在全球范围内引发了关于数据主权和数字平台监管的问题。各国正在努力应对与数据相关的国家安全问题，例如美国由于担心中国可能通过TikTok收集外国情报而禁止TikTok。日本和韩国之间的局势也引起了软银投资者的关注，他们对该问题的政治化表达了担忧。

上个月，该争端蔓延到日本首相岸田文雄和韩国总统尹锡悦的高级别会谈中，威胁要掩盖两国关系最近在历经数十年历史和领土纷争后的解冻。该合资企业是Line于2019年与Yahoo Japan合并时成立的，旨在与Facebook和国内竞争对手如乐天（Rakuten）竞争的互联网集团。

日本政府对该合资企业进行了审查，因为其中国子公司雇用的工程师能够访问Line用户的个人信息。去年11月，LY Corp承认对Naver网络的网络攻击导致约51万名Line用户和其他人的个人数据泄露。

作为对这些违规行为的回应，软银公司正在继续与Naver讨论审查当前资本结构并评估购买更多股份的可能性。同时，韩国总统办公室表示，Naver不太可能出售其在合资企业中的股份。

 **Data leak at SoftBank joint venture sparks blame game between Japan and South Korea**

A series of data leaks from a $20bn internet company formed by Japan's SoftBank Corp. and South Korea's Naver has strained relations between the two allies, highlighting government concerns over digital security that can limit tech groups' international ambitions. The joint venture, Line Yahoo, experienced network breaches blamed on insecure systems at Seoul-based Naver, its joint owner.

Japan and South Korea have been at loggerheads since the data leaks occurred. Japanese officials argue that Naver should cut its amoeba stake in A Holdings (the holding company for Line and Yahoo Japan) on security grounds. This would give SoftBank Corp, the other joint owner, a chance to seize control.

The incident has raised questions about data sovereignty and digital platform regulation worldwide. Countries are grappling with national security concerns related to data, such as the US's move to ban TikTok due to its alleged potential for collecting foreign intelligence by China. The situation between Japan and South Korea has also drawn attention from investors in SoftBank, who have expressed concern over the politicization of the issue.

The dispute spilled into top-level talks between Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol last month, threatening to overshadow a recent thaw in relations that followed decades of historical and territorial rows. The joint venture was formed when Line merged with Yahoo Japan in 2019, creating an internet group intended to compete with Facebook and domestic rivals such as Rakuten.

The Japanese government scrutinized the joint venture after it revealed that engineers employed by its subsidiary in China were able to access personal information of Line users. Last November, LY Corp admitted a cyber attack on Naver's network resulted in the leak of personal data of about 510,000 Line users and others.

In response to these breaches, SoftBank Corp is continuing discussions with Naver to review the current capital structure and assess buying a bigger stake. Meanwhile, South Korea's presidential office said Naver was unlikely to sell down its stake in the joint venture.
