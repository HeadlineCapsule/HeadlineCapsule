苹果与OpenAI合作推出人工智能新系统

# Apple 与 OpenAI 的合作：打造新 AI 系统

苹果宣布与 **OpenAI** 合作，将 ChatGPT 集成到其设备中，作为其新的“Apple Intelligence”系统的一部分，旨在赶上科技巨头竞争对手。此次合作将利用人工智能（AI）增强苹果的软件功能，包括更聪明的 Siri 语音助手和更个性化的设备功能，以提高生产力。

**全球开发者大会** 提供了见解，说明了苹果如何计划利用生成式 AI，同时解决落后于 Alphabet、微软、亚马逊和 Meta 等竞争对手的担忧。与 OpenAI 的合作将推动苹果的专有生成式 AI 功能，即“Apple Intelligence”，它是一种基于苹果自己为个人用户定制的模型的新个人智能系统。

Siri 将能够与 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 交互，在与聊天机器人通信之前寻求用户许可。此功能不需要额外的订阅，并确保无缝集成同时保持对其使用的控制。 Siri 还将在苹果本机应用程序中执行更详细的行动，允许第三方开发人员利用这些功能。

苹果在其 AI 方法中强调用户隐私，通过在设备和由其芯片供电的云服务器上运行模型来实现这一点。该公司旨在使用个人数据在设备上训练 AI 功能，确保“只有苹果才能提供的 AI”了解但不会收集个人数据。

这些新的生成式 AI 功能将适用于 iOS 18 及更高版本的 iPad 和 Mac 设备，包括图像生成和自定义表情符号。与 ChatGPT 的合作旨在向投资者保证苹果在科技行业中仍然具有竞争力。然而，特斯拉 CEO 埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 表达了对与 OpenAI 集成相关的潜在安全风险的担忧。

总之，苹果与 OpenAI 的合作以及“Apple Intelligence”的推出旨在通过 AI 驱动的功能增强用户体验，同时保持隐私标准。该公司寻求利用生成式 AI 技术来跟上科技领域快速发展的步伐，与竞争对手保持同步。

 # Summary of Apple's Partnership with OpenAI for New AI System

Apple has announced a partnership with **OpenAI** to integrate ChatGPT into its devices as part of their new "Apple Intelligence" system, aiming to catch up with Big Tech rivals. The collaboration will enhance Apple's software features using artificial intelligence (AI), including a smarter Siri voice assistant and more personalized device functionalities for improved productivity.

The **Worldwide Developers Conference** provided insights into how Apple plans to leverage generative AI, amid concerns of falling behind competitors like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. The OpenAI partnership will contribute to Apple's proprietary generative AI features dubbed "Apple Intelligence," which is described as a new personal intelligence system based on Apple's own models tailored for individual users.

Siri will be able to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT, seeking user permission before communicating with the chatbot. This feature does not require an additional subscription and ensures seamless integration while maintaining control over its usage. Siri will also perform more detailed actions on Apple's native apps, allowing third-party developers to tap into these features.

Apple emphasizes user privacy in their AI approach by running models locally on devices and cloud servers powered by their chips. The company aims to train AI features using personal data without leaving the device, ensuring that "AI as only Apple can deliver it" is aware of but does not collect personal data.

The new generative AI features will be available in iOS 18 and later versions for iPad and Mac devices, including image generation and custom emojis. The partnership with ChatGPT aims to reassure investors that Apple remains competitive within the tech industry. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed concerns over potential security risks associated with integrating OpenAI at an operating system level.

In conclusion, Apple's collaboration with OpenAI and introduction of "Apple Intelligence" aims to enhance user experience through AI-powered features while maintaining privacy standards. The company seeks to keep pace with its rivals in the rapidly evolving tech landscape by leveraging generative AI technology.
