欧洲最高评级的商业抵押贷款债券将遭遇信用危机以来的首个亏损

**欧洲商业抵押贷款债券** 面临信用危机以来的首个损失  

持有由英国购物中心、德国住房单元和法国办公室支持的高级债券的投资者，将自全球金融危机以来首次遭受损失。这包括在欧洲出售的最高评级商业抵押贷款债券的持有人。 

**Oaktree Capital Management 的购物中心：** 

通过 Oaktree Capital Management 贷款融资的三家英国购物中心的销售额预计将低于未偿还债务的价值。这将导致持有该商业抵押贷款支持证券（CMBS）中最高级别债券的投资者遭受损失。 

**Fitch 的预测：** 

评级机构 Fitch 预测，在另外两个 CMBS 交易中，包括为 Brookfield 提供贷款的一个交易中，投资于最安全的 tranche 的投资者也面临损失。这是一个重要的发展，因为没有人预计 AAA 级别的信贷会出现这样的损失。 

**商业房地产市场衰退：** 

过去两年的借贷成本上升导致了欧洲自 2008 年全球金融危机以来最严重的商业房地产市场衰退，房产价值从高峰期下跌了三分之一到五分之一。尽管当前的借贷水平比 2008 年之前更保守，但甚至在房地产支持的信贷投资中最受保护的阶层中，现在也出现了困境的迹象。 

**Elizabeth Finance CMBS：** 

该贷款于 2020 年因违约而被转移到一家特别服务公司 Mount Street，该公司试图最大限度地为投资者恢复资金，自那时以来一直处于违约状态。最近购物中心的销售预计将为债务投资者带来约 3150 万英镑的净收益，这低于应付金额（3360 万英镑）的 6.3%。 

**Mount Street 的评论：** 

Mount Street 特种服务部门负责人 James Bannister 表示，利率是一个重大问题，而且没有钱可以用来处理这些资产。大流行进一步影响了英国的非高街零售物业。 

**Haus DAC 和 River Green Finance CMBS：** 

Fitch 还预测了两个其他欧洲 CMBS 交易中最高级别债券持有人的潜在损失：Haus DAC（由德国多户住宅单元支持）和 River Green Finance 2020 DAC（由巴黎一处办公楼抵押）。这两个投资都面临着财产价值下降和运营问题带来的挑战。 

总之，由于房地产价值下降、借贷成本上升以及影响欧洲各地 CMBS 交易的其他因素，欧洲商业抵押贷款债券市场正在经历信用危机以来的首次损失。

 **European Commercial Mortgage Bonds** face first losses since credit crisis  

Investors holding senior notes backed by UK shopping centres, German housing units and French offices are set to suffer losses for the first time since the global financial crisis. This includes holders of top-rated commercial mortgage bonds sold in Europe. 

**Oaktree Capital Management's Shopping Centres:**  

The sale of three UK shopping centres, which were financed through a loan by Oaktree Capital Management, is expected to raise less than the outstanding debt value. This will result in losses for holders of the most senior bonds in this commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS).

**Fitch's Prediction:**  

Rating agency Fitch has predicted that investors in the safest tranche of two more CMBS deals, including one set up to lend to Brookfield, are also facing losses. This is a significant development as triple-A level credit was not expected to see such losses. 

**Commercial Real Estate Downturn:**  

Rising borrowing costs over the past two years have triggered Europe's worst downtn in commercial real estate since the 2amo global financial crisis, with property values falling by between a third and a fifth from their peak. Despite more conservative levels of borrowing today than in the run-up to 2008, signs of distress are now emerging among even the most protected tier of real estate-backed credit investments.

**Elizabeth Finance CMBS:**  

The loan was transferred to Mount Street, a special servicer that tries to maximize recovery for investors, in 2020 after breaching covenants and has been in default since then. The recent sale of the shopping centres is expected to deliver net proceeds of about £31.5mn to debt investors, which falls short of the amount owed (£33.6mn) by 6.3%.

**Mount Street's Comment:**  

James Bannister, head of special servicing at Mount Street, stated that interest rates have been a significant problem and there is no money left to do anything with the assets. The pandemic has further impacted these non-high street retail properties in the UK. 

**Haus DAC and River Green Finance CMBS:**  

Fitch also predicts potential losses for top-tier bondholders in two other European CMBS deals, Haus DAC (backed by German multifamily housing units) and River Green Finance 2020 DAC (secured by an office campus in Paris). Both of these investments are facing challenges due to falling property values and operational issues.

In summary, the European commercial mortgage bond market is experiencing its first losses since the credit crisis as a result of declining real estate values, rising borrowing costs, and other factors impacting various CMBS deals across Europe.
