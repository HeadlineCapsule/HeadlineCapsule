欧盟碳市场扩张将推高柴油价格

# 欧盟碳市场扩张将从2031年开始上涨柴油价格

欧盟（EU）计划扩大其碳市场，这将导致柴油价格每升至少上涨**50美分**。这一扩张旨在覆盖与二氧化碳排放相关的费用，并到2030年将温室气体排放量减少55%。

被称为ETS2（排放交易体系）的新制度将要求燃料供应商从**2027**年开始为其碳排放购买配额。这些配额的成本预计将转嫁给消费者。根据碳市场分析公司Veyt的说法，该制度到2027年将使柴油价格每升上涨约14美分，到2031年将达到54美分，因为更多措施将逐步实施。

欧盟雄心勃勃的改革还包括一项关于建筑物供暖燃料排放的计划，这将导致煤炭价格到2031年每公斤上涨**68美分**。为了减轻对低收入家庭和小企业的影响，这项征收产生的部分收入将被 направ入“社会气候基金”。该基金提倡低碳燃料和节能措施，同时旨在防止类似于法国2018年“黄马甲”运动的抗议活动。

Veyt的首席分析官Marcus Ferdinand认为，该制度将有效地触发“到2040年所有涵盖部门的排放削减波浪，相当于约4亿吨”，其中道路运输受影响最大。

德国中间偏右议员彼得·利耶（Peter Liese）谈判了ETS2措施，他表示，除非政府选择详细的决定和法规，否则没有其他方法可以减少排放。然而，法国欧洲议会环境委员会主席帕斯卡尔·卡芬（Pascal Canfin）警告说，如果碳价格过高，对所有欧洲人来说都是不可接受的。

比利时燃料经销商联合会主席Johan Mattart对谁将被该制度涵盖以及如何准备监控表示担忧。该燃料经销商集团提倡含有植物油的混合供暖燃料，以减少排放并降低消费者成本。

总之，欧盟碳市场扩张计划旨在解决气候变化问题，同时平衡对家庭和企业的经济影响。这项举措的成功将取决于有效沟通、实施和支持机制，以确保向所有部门的低碳经济公正过渡。

 # EU Carbon Market Expansion Set to Raise Diesel Prices by 2031

The European Union (EU) is set to expand its carbon market, which will result in an increase of at least **50 cents per litre** on diesel prices from 2031. This expansion aims to cover the costs associated with carbon dioxide emissions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 203
The new scheme, known as ETS2 (Emissions Trading System), will require fuel suppliers to purchase allowances for their carbon emissions starting in **2027**. The cost of these allowances is expected to be passed on to consumers. According to Veyt, a carbon market analytics firm, the scheme will add an estimated 14 cents per litre to diesel prices by 2027 and reach up to 54 cents per litre in 2031 as more measures are phased in.

The EU's ambitious reforms also include a plan for emissions from fuel used for heating buildings, which will result in an increase of **68 cents per kg** on coal prices by 2031. To mitigate the impact on lower-income households and small businesses, part of the revenues generated by this levy will be directed to a "social climate fund." This fund promotes less carbon-intensive fuels and energy efficiency measures while aiming to prevent protests similar to France's gilets jaunes movement in 2018.

Marcus Ferdinand, chief analytics officer of Veyt, believes that the scheme will be effective in triggering a "sizeable wave of emissions abatement equivalent to about 400 million tonnes over all covered sectors by 2040," with road transport being most affected.

Peter Liese, a centre-right German lawmaker who negotiated the ETS2 measure, stated that there is "no alternative" to carbon pricing for cutting emissions unless governments opt for detailed decisions and regulations. However, Pascal Canfin, the French chair of the European parliament's environment committee, warned that if the carbon price becomes too high, it would be unacceptable to all Europeans.

Johan Mattart, head of the Belgian Federation of Fuel Distributors, expressed concerns about confusion over who will be covered by the scheme and how to prepare for monitoring. The fuel distributors group is advocating for hybrid heating fuels containing vegetable oil as a means to reduce emissions and lower costs for consumers.

In conclusion, the EU's carbon market expansion plan seeks to address climate change concerns while balancing economic impacts on households and businesses. The success of this initiative will depend on effective communication, implementation, and support mechanisms that ensure a just transition towards decarbonization across all sectors.
