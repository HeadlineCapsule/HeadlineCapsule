阿迪达斯调查中国行贿指控

**阿迪达斯调查中国贿赂指控**

在一名举报人投诉称高级管理人员从外部服务提供商那里收到数百万美元回扣后，阿迪达斯已对其中国业务中的贿赂指控展开调查。这项指控涉及阿迪达斯的营销预算和其他部门，信中指出了被指控挪用公款的特定员工。

这家德国体育用品公司确认收到了6月7日的信件，其中强调了其中国业务中可能存在的合规性问题。阿迪达斯致力于在运营的所有市场遵守法律和道德标准，并已聘请外部法律顾问进行深入调查。目前，尚未有被指控的个人被停职。

这些指控出现在阿迪达斯试图从新冠疫情的影响中恢复过来之际，由于封锁和消费者对西方品牌在新疆棉问题上的立场提出反弹，该公司在2019年至2022年之间销售额大幅下滑。该公司的新中国首席执行官Adrian Siu承诺通过推出爱国主义服装系列来重新赢得中国消费者的信任，并致力于在2023年实现两位数的销售增长率，此前2022年第四季度销售额已显著增长。

举报信的匿名作者没有提供确凿证据，但似乎对阿迪达斯中国的内部问题了如指掌。调查仍在进行中，该公司仍致力于解决任何潜在的合规性问题。

 **Adidas Investigates Bribery Allegations in China**

Adidas has initiated an investigation into bribery claims within its Chinese operations following a whistleblower complaint alleging senior managers received millions of euros in kickbacks from external service providers. The accusation involves Adidas' marketing budget and other divisions, with the letter naming specific employees accused of embezzlement.

The German sportswear company confirmed receiving the letter on June n7, which highlighted potential compliance violations within its Chinese operations. Adidas is committed to adhering to legal and ethical standards in all markets it operates and has engaged external legal counsel for an intensive investigation. No accused individuals have been placed on leave as of now.

The allegations come at a time when Adidas is attempting to recover from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw sales plummet between 2019 and 2022 due to lockdowns and consumer backlash against western brands over their stance on Xinjiang cotton. The company's new China CEO Adrian Siu has pledged to regain the trust of Chinese consumers with patriotic clothing lines, aiming for a double-digit sales growth rate in 2023 after a significant surge in Q4 2022.

The whistleblower report's anonymous authors did not provide hard evidence but appear to be well-informed about internal issues within Adidas China. The investigation is ongoing, and the company remains committed to addressing any potential compliance violations.
