苹果公司将成为首家根据欧盟数字法律面临指控的大型科技集团

翻译：
苹果公司将成首个在欧盟数字法下被控的大科技集团。 

(注：为了符合中文表达习惯，最后一句稍微调整了一下语序)

**文章摘要**

苹果公司即将成为首个面临欧盟新数字法律——即《数字市场法案》(DMA)指控的大型科技集团。欧盟委员会认定，苹果未履行允许应用程序开发者引导用户在不收取费用的情况下离开其应用商店的义务。这将是首次有科技公司在旨在开放像苹果、字母表（Alphabet，谷歌母公司）和Meta（Facebook的所有者）等强大在线守门人业务以促进欧盟竞争的立法下面临指控。

如果被认定违反DMA规定，苹果可能每天因不合规而面临高达其全球平均日营业额5%的罚款，目前这一数额略超过10亿美元。对苹果的指控预计很快就会到来，但监管机构仅做出了初步发现，在做出最终决定前，该公司仍有可能纠正其行为。

欧盟也可能宣布对字母表和Meta等其他科技集团的指控，原因是它们偏爱自己的应用商店或使用个人数据进行广告宣传。苹果最近宣布了对其在欧盟的iOS移动软件、App Store和Safari浏览器的更改，允许用户访问竞争对手的应用商店并从其他来源下载应用程序。然而，欧盟也在调查这些费用变更是否符合新的数字规则。

美国对苹果提起反垄断诉讼，指控其利用在智能手机领域的权力打压对手，限制消费者选择。2020年起诉苹果App Store政策的Epic Games正在等待加州联邦法官就苹果是否违反了禁止引导规则的禁令做出裁决。

截至2024年第二季度，消费者在苹果应用商店的支出相对平稳，表明欧盟规定尚未对公司的利润产生重大影响。

 **Article Summary**

Apple is set to be the first Big Tech group facing charges under the EU's new digital law, known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The European Commission has determined that Apple is not complying with obligations to allow app developers to "steer" users outside its App Store without imposing fees. This would be the first time a tech company faces charges under this legislation designed to open up businesses of powerful online gatekeepers, like Apple, Alphabet (Google's parent), and Meta (Facebook's owner) to competition in the EU.

If found guilty of breaking DMA rules, Apple could face daily penaltamoins for non-compliance of up to 5% of its average daily worldwide turnover, which is currently just over $1 billion. The charges against Apple are expected soon, but regulators have only made preliminary findings and the company may still correct its practices before any final decision is reached.

The EU could also announce charges against other tech groups like Alphabet and Meta for favoring their own app stores or using personal data for advertising. Apple has recently announced changes to its iOS mobile software, App Store, and Safari browser in the EU, allowing users access to rival app stores and download apps from other sources. However, the EU is also investigating whether these fee changes adhere to new digital rules.

The US brought an antitrust case against Apple for allegedly using its power in the smartphone sector to squash rivals and limit consumer choice. Epic Games, which sued Apple over the App Store in 2020, is awaiting a decision from a California federal judge on whether Apple failed to comply with an injunction prohibiting steering rules.

Consumer spending on Apple's App Store throughout Q2 of 2024 was relatively flat, suggesting that EU rules have yet to affect the company's bottom line significantly.
