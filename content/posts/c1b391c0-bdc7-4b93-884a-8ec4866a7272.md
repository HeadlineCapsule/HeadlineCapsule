# 阿斯利康退出新冠疫苗市场

阿斯利康（AstraZeneca）宣布退出其**新冠疫苗**「**Vaxzevria**」的市场，理由是针对新变种的**更新疫苗**供应过剩。这项决定为这款疫苗近四年的历程画下句点，从疫情初期与牛津大学（Oxford University）科学家合作快速开发，到获得批准并分发全球，已供应超过**30亿剂**。

**Vaxzevria**最初采用**非营利模式**，以成本价出售，在疫情爆发的第一年发挥了关键作用，据估计，它**挽救了超过650万条生命**。然而，它在推广时面临挑战，原因包括罕见的**血栓**事件和与**欧洲联盟**在获取疫苗方面的紧张关系。

现在，该疫苗已被基于**mRNA技术**的竞争对手疫苗所取代，如BioNTech/辉瑞（BioNTech/Pfizer）和莫德纳（Moderna）生产的疫苗，后者已成为全球最广泛使用的疫苗。阿斯利康的疫苗收入也反映了这一转变，从2021年的近**40亿美元**骤降至2023年的**1.2亿美元**。

这款疫苗虽然获得**英国**和**欧盟**的批准，但因数据呈现问题，从未在美国获得批准。阿斯利康坚称，退出市场与罕见的血栓问题无关，并将与监管机构和合作伙伴密切合作，完成这一过渡过程。

# AstraZeneca withdraws Covid-19 vaccine

AstraZeneca has announced the withdrawal of its **Covid-19 vaccine**, **Vaxzevria**, citing a "surplus of available updated vaccines" targeting newer variants as the primary reason for the decision. This announcement brings an end to the vaccine's nearly four-year journey, from its rapid development with Oxford University scientists during the pandemic's early days to its approval and distribution, with over **3 billion doses supplied worldwide**. 

**Vaxzevria** was unique in its initial **non-profit model**, sold "at cost," and played a crucial role in the pandemic's first year, with estimates suggesting it saved **over 6.5 million lives**. However, its rollout faced challenges due to rare **blood clotting** incidents and tensions with the **European Union** over access. 

The vaccine has now been superseded by **mRNA technology-based jabs** from competitors BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, which have become the most widely used globally. AstraZeneca's vaccine revenue reflected this shift, dropping from nearly **$4 billion in 2021** to **$12 million in 2023**. 

While the vaccine was approved in the **UK** and **EU**, it never received approval in the **US** due to data presentation concerns. AstraZeneca maintains that the withdrawal is unrelated to the rare blood clotting issues and that they will work closely with regulators and partners to navigate this transition.
