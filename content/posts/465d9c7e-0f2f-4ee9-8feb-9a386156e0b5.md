欧盟推迟巴塞尔银行交易改革，美国重新审视计划

# 欧盟推迟巴塞尔银行交易改革

欧盟（EU）决定将危机后银行业改革的关键条款，即《巴塞尔III》一揽子计划推迟一年。做出这一决定是因为预计美国监管机构将推迟实施，并旨在在欧洲贷款人之间保持“公平竞争环境”。

## 背景：巴塞尔III一揽子计划

巴塞尔III一揽子计划是在2008年金融危机后商定的雄心勃勃的银行业监管改革，最初计划于2025年完成。其中包括限制市场风险的措施，因为银行从客户那里购买和出售证券，要求投资银行对其批发交易账簿持有更多资本。

## 推迟的原因：公平竞争环境问题

欧盟的决定，得到了法国的支持，是因为有迹象表明美国监管机构将允许推迟所谓的“巴塞尔终局”。欧洲委员会决定将“交易账簿的根本性审查”（FRTB）推迟到2026年1月。

## 欧盟和美国监管行动：不同的时间表

欧盟推迟实施是为了确保其银行与美国和英国同行相比不会处于不利地位，因为更严格的资本要求可能会影响交易业务的竞争力。美国计划于2025年7月实施其版本的巴塞尔终局规则，但面临着银行业的强烈游说，导致对初步提案提出了数百条意见。

## 法国总统的呼吁：推动变革

欧盟推迟实施是在法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙呼吁修订巴塞尔协议实施之后做出的，他表示欧盟“不能是世界上唯一一个应用该协议的经济区”。其余的巴塞尔协议实施一揽子计划仍将按原定时间表于2025年开始实施。

## 美国监管机构的回应：潜在变化

美国联邦储备委员会是美国支持巴塞尔终局工作的一部分，它表示最终规则可能会“广泛而显著地”进行修改。美联储目前正与其他监管机构合作，以解决金融业提出的意见。

 **EU Delays Basel Bank Trading Reforms**  
The European Union (EU) has decided to delay key provisions of post-crisis banking reforms, known as the Basel III package, for one year. This decision was made due to expected delays in implementation by US regulators and aims to maintain a "level playing field" among lenders across Europe.

**Background: The Basel III Package**  
The Basel III package is an ambitious overhaul of bank regulation agreed upon after the 2008 financial crisis, with completion initially planned for 2025. It includes measures to limit market risk as banks buy and sell securities from clients by requiring investment banks to hold more capital against their wholesale trading books.

**Reason for Delay: Level Playing Field Concerns**  
The EU's decision, championed by France, was influenced by signs that US regulators would allow delays in the so-called "Basel Endgame." The European Commission decided to defer the "fundamental review of the trading book" (FRTB) to January 2026.

**EU and US Regulatory Actions: Different Timelines**  
The EU's delay aims to ensure that its banks are not disadvantaged compared to American and British counterparts, as stricter capital requirements could impact competitiveness in the trading business. The US has planned to implement its version of Basel Endgame rules by July 2025 but faced aggressive lobbying efforts from banks that led to hundreds of comments on initial proposals.

**French President's Call for Revision: A Push for Change**  
The delay in the EU comes after French President Emmanuel Macron called for a revision of Basel implementation, stating that the EU "cannot be the only economic area in the world to apply it." The rest of the remaining Basel implementation package will still apply from 2025 as scheduled.

**US Regulatory Response: Potential Changes Ahead**  
The US Federal Reserve, which is part of the efforts behind Basel Endgame, has indicated that "broad and material changes" are likely to be made to the final rule. The Fed is currently working with other regulators to address comments from the financial industry.
