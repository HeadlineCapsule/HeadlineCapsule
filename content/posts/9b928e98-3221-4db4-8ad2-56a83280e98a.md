# 刚果（金）部队声称挫败了“涉及外国人的**政变**”

刚果民主共和国（**刚果（金）**）**国防和安全部队**声称于周日成功阻止了一次针对该国政府的“**政变企图**”。**军方发言人西尔万·埃肯格将军**强调，**外国人**和**刚果国民**都参与了此次事件，并确认包括其领导人在内的参与者已被**制服**。未经证实的**社交媒体视频**和当地媒体报道指出，自我流亡的反对派**政治家克里斯蒂安·马兰加**参与了事件，一名高级政府官员证实了这一初步怀疑。马兰加在Facebook Live视频中出现在总统办公室大楼，身边有几名男子手持前**扎伊尔**国旗，对费利克斯·齐塞克迪总统进行威胁。据一名发言人称，此次未遂政变还包括对知名政治家维塔尔·卡梅尔的住所发动袭击。此次事件引发了美国驻刚果（金）大使卢西·塔姆林的关切，尤其对有关美国公民参与其中的报道表示关切。刚果（金）政府通讯部长帕特里克·穆亚亚确认袭击者已被制服。这起事件凸显了刚果（金）的政治紧张局势，该国拥有丰富的矿产资源，却饱受贫困和冲突困扰。

# Congolese Forces Claim to Have Thwarted Coup 'Involving Foreign Nationals' 

**Defense and security forces** in the Democratic Republic of Congo (**DRC**) asserted they had successfully prevented an **"attempted coup"** on Sunday, targeting the nation's government. The involvement of both **foreign and Congolese nationals** was highlighted by **army spokesperson General Sylvain Ekenge**, who also confirmed the neutralization of the participants, including their leader. Unverified **social media videos** and local media reports pointed to the involvement of self-exiled opposition **politician Christian Malanga**, with a senior government official corroborating this initial suspicion. Malanga, in a Facebook live video, appeared at the president's office building, flanked by men holding the flag of the former **Zaire**, threatening President Félix Tshisekedi. The alleged coup attempt also included an attack on the residence of prominent politician Vital Kamerhe, according to his spokesman. The incident drew concern from the US ambassador to the DRC, Lucy Tamlyn, particularly regarding reports of American citizens' involvement. The Congolese government's communications minister, Patrick Muyaya, confirmed that the attackers had been incapacitated. This event underscores the political tensions in the DRC, a country rich in mineral resources yet plagued by poverty and conflict.
