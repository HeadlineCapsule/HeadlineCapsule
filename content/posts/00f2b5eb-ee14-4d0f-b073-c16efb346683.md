# 谁怕美国证券交易委员会？罗宾汉的投资者不怕

**罗宾汉**（Robinhood）的投资者似乎不担心**美国证券交易委员会（SEC）**即将采取法律行动的消息，股价保持稳定。这与市场去年对**币安（Binance）**和** Coinbase** 类似消息的反应形成鲜明对比，当时资产被撤出，市值暴跌。在**加里·根斯勒（Gary Gensler）**领导的美国证券交易委员会（SEC）积极针对**加密货币行业**，声称**数字代币**为**证券**，因此**加密货币交易所**交易未注册证券。尽管采取了法律行动，而且** FTX 倒闭**，但加密货币市场已经反弹，**比特币** 达到新高，Coinbase 和罗宾汉的股价飙升。**现货比特币 ETF** 的批准也提振了情绪。然而，投资者不应该低估监管风险，因为加密货币已经成为罗宾汉的重要增长动力，在第一季度贡献了 20% 的净收入。随着加密货币爱好者**唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）**可能重返白宫，加密货币监管的前景仍不确定。

美国证券交易委员会对加密货币行业的打击引发了一波法律行动，但市场表现出韧性。虽然币安和 Coinbase 的投资者对美国证券交易委员会诉讼的消息反应强烈，但罗宾汉的投资者则淡然处之，表明对该公司应对监管挑战的能力产生了认知转变或信心。随着加密货币成为罗宾汉越来越重要的收入来源，市场没有出现震荡可能表明该行业正在走向成熟，学会了如何应对监管风暴。

# Who is afraid of the SEC? Not Robinhood Investors 

**Investors** in Robinhood appear unfazed by the news of impending legal action from the **SEC**, with shares remaining steady. This is in stark contrast to the market's reaction to similar news regarding **Binance** and **Coinbase** last year, where assets were pulled and market value dropped. The SEC, under **Gary Gensler**, has been actively targeting the **crypto industry**, arguing that **digital tokens** are **securities**, and thus, **crypto exchanges** are dealing in unregistered securities. Despite the legal actions and the **collapse of FTX**, the crypto market has rebounded, with **Bitcoin** reaching new highs and shares in Coinbase and Robinhood surging. The approval of **spot Bitcoin ETFs** has also boosted sentiment. However, investors should not underestimate the regulatory risks, as crypto has become a significant growth driver for Robinhood, contributing 20% of net revenue in the first quarter. With **Donald Trump**, a crypto enthusiast, potentially returning to the White House, the future of crypto regulation remains uncertain.

The SEC's crackdown on the crypto industry has led to a wave of legal actions, yet the market has shown resilience. While investors in Binance and Coinbase reacted strongly to the news of SEC lawsuits, Robinhood investors have taken the news in stride, indicating a shift in perception or confidence in the company's ability to navigate regulatory challenges. With crypto becoming an increasingly important source of revenue for Robinhood, the absence of a market spasm could be indicative of a maturing industry that is learning to weather regulatory storms.
