投资者重燃对欧洲科技初创公司的热情

# 欧洲科技初创企业投资复兴

在过去的两年里，欧洲科技初创企业行业经历了投资荒漠期，但最近出现了一股明显的投资热潮。Creandum 和 Accel Europe 等关键参与者快速募集了大量资金，表明该地区早期阶段的公司正在重返增长轨道。

以支持 Spotify、Klarna 和 Depop 等成功初创企业而闻名的 **Creandum** 最近宣布了 50 亿欧元的基金，而 **Accel Europe** 上个月推出了 6.5 亿美元的基金。此外，专注于“深度科技”初创企业并重视伦敦和塔林的 Plural 为其风险投资工作筹集了总共 6 亿欧元的资金。

投资复兴归功于对人工智能（AI）初创企业日益增长的兴趣以及华尔街大科技公司估值上涨强劲。根据欧洲大型风投公司 Atomico 的 Tom Wehmeier 的话说，有“绿芽”迹象表明市场已经超越了恢复阶段，正在进入增长阶段。

投资者们指出，许多初创企业在 2023 年经济衰退期间被迫削减成本，但现在随着收入增长加速，变得更加可持续，从而成为有吸引力的投资机会。这种重新兴趣甚至促使 Andreessen Horowitz 和 IVP 等硅谷巨头在伦敦开设办事处。

Creandum 令人印象深刻的回报记录表明，欧洲风险投资公司可以与硅谷同行相媲美，他们投资的六家公司中就有一家达到 10 亿美元以上的估值。然而，并非所有基金都发现很容易筹集资金；Atomico 仍在最终确定其有史以来规模最大的募资活动，目标是跨风险和增长基金筹集高达 13.5 亿美元，但由于投资者对后期阶段公司谨慎行事以及缺乏成功的 IPO，该基金面临挑战。

总之，欧洲科技初创企业生态系统似乎正处于上升期，早期阶段的融资活动增加，这是由人工智能初创企业的人气和大科技公司估值推动的。预计这种复兴将在 2024 年持续下去，因为投资者重新建立对市场的信心。

 # Article Summary: Revival in European Tech Startup Investments

In recent developments within the **European tech startup** sector, there has been a noticeable revival of investor enthusiasm after experiencing an investment drought over two years. Key players such as Creandum and Accel Europe have raised significant funds in record time, signaling a return to growth for early-stage companies within the region.

**Creandum**, known for backing successful startups like Spotify, Klarna, and Depop, recently announced a €50n fund, while **Accel Europe** launched a $650mn fund last month. Additionally, Plural, targeting "deep tech" startups with an emphasis on London and Tallinn, raised a total of €600mn for its venture capital efforts.

The revival in investments is attributed to the growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) startups and a strong rally in Big Tech valuations on Wall Street. According to Tom Wehmeier from Atomico, one of Europe's largest VC companies, there are "green shoots" indicating that the market has moved beyond recovery and is now entering a growth phase.

Investors have noted that many startups forced to cut costs during 2economic downturn in 2023 are now more sustainable with accelerated revenue growth, making them attractive for investment opportunities. This renewed interest has even prompted Silicon Valley giants like Andreessen Horowitz and IVP to open offices in London.

Creandum's impressive track record of returns demonstrates that European VC firms can match the performance of their Silicon Valley counterparts, with one in six companies they invested in reaching a valuation of over $1 billion. However, not all funds have found it easy to raise capital; Atomico is still finalizing its largest-ever fundraise targeting up to $1.35bn across venture and growth funds but has faced challenges due to investor caution around later-stage companies amidst a lack of successful IPOs.

In conclusion, the European tech startup ecosystem appears to be on an upswing with increased activity in early-stage funding, driven by AI startups' popularity and Big Tech valuations. This resurgence is expected to continue throughout 2024 as investors regain confidence in the market.
