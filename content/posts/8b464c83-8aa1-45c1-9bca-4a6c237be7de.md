# **名创优品**将扩张重点转向海外

**名创优品**，一家知名的**中国低价零售商**，正在调整其扩张战略，重点关注国际市场。计划在 2023 年在海外开设大约 **600 家门店**，主要分布在 **亚洲**。这标志着自 **2019 年**以来的重大转变，因为这将是该公司在新开门店中首次出现大部分位于中国境外。公司**首席财务官张红晨**表示，此举是因为国内市场消费疲软，以及中国制造产品的成本下降，使其在全球范围内更具**竞争力**。 

名创优品以其红白相间的 logo 和生活时尚产品而闻名，发展迅速。截至 2023 年，在中国拥有约 **4000 家门店**，在海外拥有近 **2500 家**。这些门店大部分是**加盟店**。名创优品的成功部分归功于中国购物者选择更便宜的商品，以及其吸引受通货膨胀影响的海外经济体消费者的能力。该公司还受益于销售**漫威、Hello Kitty 和迪士尼**等热门品牌的授权产品。 

名创优品独特的经营方式有别于专注于无品牌超低价商品的中国竞争对手，预计这将推动其未来几年的增长。其线上线下销售结合的策略也促进了其成功，线上销售额现已占总销售额的**10%**以上。然而，该公司也面临着挑战，包括在中国因营销失误引发的民族主义反弹和做空机构的批评。此后，名创优品重新定位自己为**中国特色品牌**，在产品和营销中融合中国设计和传统元素。

# Fast-growing Chinese retailer Miniso shifts expansion focus overseas

**Miniso**, a prominent **Chinese low-cost retailer**, is shifting its expansion strategy to focus on international markets, with plans to open approximately **600 stores abroad** in 2023, mainly in **Asia**. This marks a significant shift from previous years, as it will be the first time since **2019** that most of its new outlets are outside of China. The company's **CFO, Eason Zhang**, attributed this move to weak consumption in the domestic market and the falling cost of goods produced in China, making them more **competitive globally**. 

/n/n

Miniso, known for its red-and-white logo and lifestyle products, has experienced rapid growth, with about **4,000 stores in China** and nearly **2,500 overseas** as of 2023. The majority of these stores are **franchises**. Miniso's success is partly due to Chinese shoppers "trading down" to more affordable options and its ability to attract consumers in inflation-affected economies abroad. The company also benefits from selling licensed goods from popular brands like **Marvel, Hello Kitty, and Disney**. 

/n/n

Miniso's unique approach, differentiating itself from Chinese rivals focusing on unbranded ultra-low-cost goods, is expected to drive its growth in the next few years. Its blend of physical stores and online sales, now contributing over **10%** of total sales, has also been a factor in its success. However, the company has faced challenges, including a nationalist backlash in **China** due to a marketing misstep and criticism from short sellers. Miniso has since repositioned itself as a **distinctly Chinese brand**, integrating Chinese design and traditions into its products and marketing.
