哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织回应乔·拜登加沙和平计划

# 摘要：
本文讨论了哈马斯和巴勒斯坦伊斯兰圣战组织对美国总统乔·拜登提出的加沙冲突和平计划的反应。该冲突已持续了八个月。这两个团体表示愿意积极处理达成协议的事宜，优先考虑他们的人民的利益，结束战争，并撤出以色列在整个加沙地带的部队。然而，他们没有在回应中提供具体细节，而是提出了对该提案的“修正案”。

美国国家安全委员会确认收到了哈马斯的回复，并正在评估中。卡塔尔和埃及也收到了巴勒斯坦派别的回复，并将继续进行调解，直到达成协议。拜登两周前提出的计划包括一个分三个阶段结束冲突的方法：

1. 立即停火，释放一些以色列人质，以换取从以色列监狱释放巴勒斯坦囚犯；以色列部队撤出加沙人口稠密地区，并提供援助。
2. 在各方同意的情况下，永久停止敌对行动，归还所有剩余的人质，并全面撤出以色列在加沙的部队。
3. 在最后阶段进行多年重建工作。

该计划遭到以色列政府内部极右翼派别的反对，两个极端民族主义政党威胁说，如果总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡接受该计划，他们就会推翻他。尽管如此，一名以色列官员表示，该国不会在实现所有目标之前结束战争，包括摧毁哈马斯并收回该武装组织 10 月 7 日袭击中绑架的人质。

联合国安理会投票赞成拜登的计划，只有俄罗斯弃权。

 **Summary:**  
The article discusses Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad's response to US President Joe Biden’s proposed peace plan for the Gaza conflict, which has been ongoing for eight months. The two groups expressed readiness to deal positively with reaching an agreement that prioritizes their people's interests, ending the war, and withdrawing Israeli forces from the entire Gaza Strip. However, they did not provide specific details in their response, instead offering "amendments" to the proposal.

The US National Security Council confirmed receipt of Hamas’s reply and is currently evaluating it. Qatar and Egypt have also received a response from Palestinnian factions and will continue mediation efforts until an agreement is reached. The plan, presented by Biden two weeks ago, involves a three-stage approach to ending the conflict:
1. An immediate ceasefire with some Israeli hostages freed in exchange for releasing Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails; withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's populated areas and an influx of aid.
2. A permanent end to hostilities, return of all remaining hostages, and full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza upon agreement between the parties.
3. A multiyear reconstruction effort in the final stage.

The plan has faced backlnash from far-right factions within Israel's government, with two ultranationalist parties threatening to topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he accepts it. Despite this, an Israeli official stated that the country would not end the war until achieving all its goals, including the destruction of Hamas and return of hostages seized by the militant group in October 7th attack.

The UN Security Council has voted in favor of Biden's plan with only Russia abstaining.
