阿托斯选择Onepoint重组计划，对丹尼尔·克列茨基尼是一个打击

**阿托斯** 选择了最大股东 Onepoint 的大卫·拉亚尼 (David Layani) 领导的重组计划，而不是捷克亿万富翁丹尼尔·克雷茨基尼 (Daniel Křetínský) 的竞争提案。这家法国 IT 服务公司背负着 48 亿欧元的债务负担，其股价在过去三年中暴跌。

**Onepoint 财团** 提议将约 29 亿欧元的债务转换为股权，注入 2.5 亿欧元的新资金，并提供约 15 亿欧元的新债务，包括 3 亿欧元的银行担保。该计划旨在让阿托斯主要在法国的控制下保持完整，但会大大稀释股东权益。

**阿托斯主席让-皮埃尔·穆斯特里尔** (Jean-Pierre Mustier) 表示，所选择的解决方案符合利益相关者的利益，尤其是员工和客户。这一决定是基于债权人对 Onepoint 提案的支持而做出的，预计这将导致一项最终的财务重组协议。

捷克商人丹尼尔·克雷茨基尼 (Daniel Křetínský) 面临失望，因为他早些时候购买阿托斯亏损业务的交易在 2 月份破裂。他在零售、媒体和物流等多个国家扩大了他的投资组合。

法国政府正在寻求收购阿托斯的三个部分，这些部分被认为对国家安全至关重要，包括法国军队核武器计划使用的量子计算超级计算机和某些网络安全资产。该流程可能涉及 Bpifrance 等合作伙伴或泰雷兹 (Thales) 等国防公司。

 **Atos** chooses restructuring plan led by largest shareholder Onepoint's David Layani over rival proposal from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. The French IT services company has struggled under a €4.8bn debt burden and its shares have collapsed in the past three years.

**Onepoint consortium** proposes converting about €2.9bn of debt into equity, injecting €250mn of new funds, and providing roughly €1.5bn of new debt including €300mn bank guarantees. This plan aims to keep Atos largely intact under French control but will massively dilute shareholders.

**Atos chair Jean-Pierre Mustier** states that the chosen solution aligns with stakeholders' interests, particularly employees and clients. The decision was made based on creditors' support for Onepoint's proposal, which is expected to lead to a definitive financial restructuring agreement.

Czech businessman Daniel Křetínský faces disappointment as his earlier deal to buy Atos' lossmaking legacy business fell apart in February. He has been expanding his portfolio in retail, media, and logistics across various countries.

The French state is seeking to acquire three parts of Atos deemed important for national security, including super calculators for quantum computing used by the French army's nuclear weapons program and certain cybersecurity assets. The process may involve partners such as Bpifrance or defense companies like Thales.
