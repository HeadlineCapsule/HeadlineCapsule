凯雷集团探讨出售电力生产商Cogentrix能源公司

**文章摘要：**

凯雷集团正在探索出售其电力生产商子公司 **Cogentrix Energy**。该公司已聘请顾问，潜在的售价可能在$30亿至$40亿美元之间。Cogentrix在美国各地拥有13家天然气发电厂的股份，并于2012年从高盛手中被凯雷收购。

此次出售是更大趋势的一部分，因为投资者越来越有兴趣购买和投资电厂，原因是猜测数据中心和用于人工智能的数字基础设施将推动对电力前所未有的需求。这导致了公用事业部门内的一系列交易浪潮。

最近的例子包括全球基础设施合作伙伴（Global Infrastructure Partners）和加拿大最大的养老基金CPP Investments以62亿美元的价格收购明尼苏达州的Allete公司进行私有化交易。此外，据报道，Brookfield正在洽谈以61亿欧元的估值收购法国可再生能源生产商Neoen。

凯雷此举正值该公司寻求从数字网络带来的能源需求激增中获利，并为其基础设施部门创造显著回报之际。

 **Article Summary:** 
Carlyle is exploring the sale of its electric power producer subsidiary, **Cogentrix Energy**. The company has hired advisers and could potentially sell for $3bn-$cuadrado4bn. Cogentrix owns stakes in 13 natural gas power plants across the US and was acquired by Carlyle from Goldman Sachs in 2012.

The sale is part of a larger trend, as investors are increasingly interested in buying and investing in power plants due to speculation that data centers and digital infrastructure used for artificial intelligence will drive unprecedented demand for electricity. This has led to a wave of deals within the utilities sector.

Recent examples include Global Infrastructure Partners and Canada's largest pension fund, CPP Investments, acquiring Minnesota-based Allete in a $6.2bn take-private deal. Additionally, Brookfield is reportedly in talks to acquire French renewable power producer Neoen at a €6.1bn valuation.

Carlyle's move comes as the company seeks to capitalize on soaring energy demands from digital networks and generate significant returns for its infrastructure arm.
