# **阿波罗**和**英特尔**商谈为爱尔兰110亿美元芯片厂融资

**英特尔**（**Intel**），一家**美国半导体**公司，正与**阿波罗全球管理公司**（**Apollo Global Management**，一家**私人资本集团**）进行独家谈判，为其在爱尔兰新建**芯片制造厂**寻求资金。这表明包括英特尔在内的大型企业越来越多地转向私人资本集团而非传统银行来为**扩张项目**融资。该计划中的工厂是英特尔战略的一部分，旨在将供应链从亚洲转移到西方市场，并升级生产设施，以满足**人工智能技术**的需求。

英特尔与其他私人资本集团**科尔伯格-克拉维斯-罗伯茨**（**KKR**）和**斯通峰基础设施合伙公司**（**Stonepeak**）的初步讨论，现已发展成为与阿波罗的独家谈判，这表明潜在交易的可能性。随着英特尔进行重大业务转型，旨在重新夺回市场领导地位，这一进展也应运而生。英特尔还得到了美国政府的实质性支持，后者根据《**2022 芯片法案**》（**Chips Act 2022**）承诺提供 200 亿美元的资金和贷款，以加强英特尔在美国建造新工厂的能力。

英特尔首席执行官**帕特·盖辛格**（**Pat Gelsinger**）将该公司定位为**国家冠军**，有能力将芯片生产从亚洲转移到其他地区，特别是在与中国关系紧张的背景下。然而，英特尔的制造业务面临挑战，2023 年报告运营亏损 70 亿美元。为解决这一问题，英特尔已与**布鲁克菲尔德基础设施合作伙伴**（**Brookfield Infrastructure Partners**）等私人资本集团合作为其扩张项目融资。

阿波罗也一直在积极拓展其借贷业务，特别是在为新基础设施提供资金方面，包括**数字通信**、**数据中心**、**可再生能源**和**半导体**。在阿波罗保险业务的大力支持下，阿波罗集团有能力支持英特尔的雄心壮志。

爱尔兰政府高度依赖科技和制药公司的企业税收入，目前尚未对谈判发表评论。英特尔自1989年以来在爱尔兰的投资总额超过340亿美元，是爱尔兰经济中一个重要参与者，这一进展对该国经济意义重大。

# Apollo and Intel enter talks to finance $11bn chip plant in Ireland

**Intel**, a **US semiconductor** company, is in exclusive talks with **Apollo Global**, a **private capital group**, to secure funding for a new **chipmaking plant** in Ireland. This marks a growing trend of large corporations, including Intel, turning to private capital groups instead of traditional banks for funding **expansion projects**. The planned plant is part of Intel's aggressive strategy to **shift supply chains from Asia to Western markets** and modernize its production facilities to meet the demands of **artificial intelligence technology**. 

Intel's initial discussions with other private capital groups, **KKR** and **Stonepeak**, have now progressed to exclusive talks with Apollo, indicating a potential deal. This development comes as Intel undergoes a significant business transformation, aiming to regain its leadership position in the market. The company has also received substantial support from the US government, which pledged $20 billion in funding and loans under the **2022 Chips Act** to boost Intel's capacity to build new plants in the US. 

Intel's CEO, **Pat Gelsinger**, has positioned the company as a **national champion** capable of shifting chip production away from Asia, particularly amid tensions with China. However, Intel's manufacturing business has faced challenges, reporting operating losses of $7 billion in 2023. To address this, Intel has already partnered with private capital groups, such as **Brookfield Infrastructure Partners**, to finance its expansion projects. 

Apollo, too, has been actively expanding its lending activities, particularly in the realm of funding new infrastructure, including **digital communications**, **data centers**, **renewable energy**, and **semiconductors**. With Apollo's insurance business providing significant backing, the group is well-positioned to support Intel's ambitious plans. 

The Irish government, heavily reliant on corporation taxes from tech and pharma companies, has not yet commented on the talks. Intel's long-standing presence in Ireland, with investments totaling over $34 billion since 1989, makes this a significant development for the country's economy.
