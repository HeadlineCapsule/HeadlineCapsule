大多数美国选民认为特朗普的刑事审判具有“政治动机”

**文章摘要**

蒙茅斯大学（Monmouth University）的一项最新民调显示，大多数美国选民认为前总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在纽约的审判是出于政治动机。这项调查是在特朗普上个月被裁定34项罪名成立之后进行的，结果显示：

- 超过一半的美国人（57%）和几乎所有共和党人（93%）相信针对特朗普的“封口费”案件是出于政治动机，而不是法律因素。
- 近三分之二的民主党人认为，对亨特·拜登（Hunter Biden）提出联邦枪支指控也是出于政治动机。本周，亨特成为首位被定罪的美国总统子女。
- 自从特朗普在曼哈顿的审判于去年秋天开始以来，选民的意向几乎没有改变：全国有略超过四成的注册选民表示，他们“肯定”或“可能”会投票给乔·拜登（Joe Biden），而支持特朗普的人数也类似。
- 一项单独的路透社/益普索（Reuters/Ipsos）民调发现，80%的注册选民表示，亨特·拜登因刑事枪支指控而被定罪不会影响他们投票给乔·拜登的可能性。

蒙茅斯大学的民调突显了选民中的党派分歧，以及这些判决对选民的影响有限，因为特朗普仍面临三项与试图推翻2020年总统大选结果和处理机密文件相关的刑事审判。

 **Article Summary**

A recent poll from Monmouth University reveals that most American voters perceive former President Donald Trump's trial in New York as politically motivated. The survey, conducted after Trump was found guilty on 34 counts last month, shows:

- Over half of Americans (57%) and nearly all Republicans (93%) believe the "hush money" case against Trump is driven by politics rather than legal considerations.
- Almost two-thirds of Democrats think that prosecuting Hunter Biden on federal gun charges was also politically motivated, with Hunter becoming the first child of a US president to be convicted of a crime this week.
- Voter intentions have barely changed since Trump's trial in Manhattan began last autumn: just over four in 10 registered voters nationwide said they would "definitely" or "probably" vote for President Joe Biden, with similar numbers for Trump.
- A separate Reuters/Ipsos survey found that 80% of registered voters say Hunter Biden's conviction on criminal gun charges will not affect their likelihood of voting for Joe Biden.

The Monmouth poll underscores the partisan divide in the electorate and limited impact these verdicts have had on voters, with Trump still facing three criminal trials related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and handling of classified documents.
