# 苏纳克在选前演讲中声称若工党执政英国将**不那么安全**

英国首相里希·苏纳克警告称，若工党成立政府，英国将**不那么安全**，他敦促选民在即将到来的选举中坚持选择“熟悉的魔鬼”。苏纳克的此番言论正值以色列军队在加沙北部与哈马斯发生激烈冲突之际，该地区之前曾被宣称已清除巴勒斯坦武装组织。加沙局势仍然紧张，哈马斯向以色列南部发射火箭弹，以色列军方则以空袭回应。冲突造成的人员伤亡不断增加，目前已造成至少35,000名巴勒斯坦人死亡，数万人流离失所。联合国警告称加沙可能出现“**人为饥荒**”，因为人道主义援助的发放受到严重阻碍。与此同时，英国首相里希·苏纳克面临政治挑战，在他发表演讲期间，反政府抗议活动在军事公墓爆发。

# Sunak claims UK will be less safe under Labour in pre-election speech

Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, has warned that the country will be less safe under a Labour government, as he urged voters to stick with the "devil they know" in the upcoming election. Sunak's comments come as Israeli troops engage in fierce fighting with Hamas in northern Gaza, an area previously claimed to be cleared of the Palestinian militant group. The situation in Gaza remains tense, with Hamas firing rockets into southern Israel and the Israeli military responding with air raids. The human toll of the conflict continues to rise, with at least 35,000 Palestinians killed and thousands more displaced. The UN has warned of a "man-made famine" in Gaza, as the distribution of humanitarian aid is severely curtailed. Meanwhile, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak faces political challenges, with anti-government protests breaking out at military cemeteries during his speeches.
