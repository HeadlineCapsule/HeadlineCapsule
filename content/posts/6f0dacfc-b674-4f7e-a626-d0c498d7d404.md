必和必拓与英美资源集团面临困境，谈判未取得进展

**摘要：**
在周三谈判截止日期来临之际，必和必拓（BHP）和英美资源集团（Anglo American）390亿英镑的采矿业巨额合并谈判陷入僵局。尽管英美资源批准了延期，但双方仍就交易结构存在分歧，尤其是关于接管顺序以及南非铂金和铁矿石业务分拆的争议。必和必拓首席执行官迈克·亨利（Mike Henry）一直在与投资者会面，向英美资源施压以寻求再次延长截止时间，但伦敦时间周三下午5点前达成解决方案的可能性不大。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：BHP和英美资源在合并谈判中的主要争议点是什么？
   答案：主要分歧围绕交易结构展开，尤其是接管顺序以及南非铂金和铁矿石业务分拆的问题。此外，双方还就BHP完成对英美资源的收购之前提前剥离这些资产的潜在执行风险存在争议。

2. 问题：这次合并谈判的结果可能对两家公司的股东产生什么影响？
   答案：结果可能会对股东产生重大影响。如果合并成功，他们将获得分拆业务的股票。然而，如果英美资源关于潜在的“公共利益”让步和执行风险的担忧成为现实，可能会对两家公司的股价产生负面影响并惩罚投资者。

3. 问题：哪些外部因素可能影响这些合并谈判的结果？
   答案：周三南非即将举行的全国选举增加了局势的政治复杂性，因为采矿部长格韦德·曼塔什（Gwede Mantashe）在最近几周表达了对该交易的反对意见。此外，两家公司的高管和政府领导人之间举行了多次闭门会议，这可能会缓解批评并影响谈判结果。

**Summary of Article:**
BHP and Anglo American are facing a deadlock in their £39bn mining megamerger talks as they approach the final hours before the negotiation deadline expires on Wednesday. Despite an extension granted by Anglo, disagreements persist over deal structure, particularly regarding the sequencing of the takeover and spinning off stakes in South African platinum and iron ore units. BHP's CEO Mike Henry has been meeting investors to pressure Anglo for another deadline extension, but a resolution seems unlikely by 5pm London time on Wedneseby.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: What are the main points of contention between BHP and Anglo American in their merger negotiations?
   A: The primary disagreements revolve around the deal structure, specifically the sequencing of the takeover and spinning off stakes in South African platinum and iron ore units. Additionally, there is a dispute over potential execution risks associated with demerging these assets before BHP completes its takeover of Anglo American.
   
2. Q: How might the outcome of this merger negotiation impact shareholders from both companies?
   A: The outcome could significantly affect shareholders, as a successful merger would result in them receiving stocks in the demerged businesses. However, if Anglo American's concerns about potential "public interest" concessions and execution risks materialize, it may negatively impact the respective companies' share prices and penalize investors.
   
3. Q: What external factors could influence the outcome of these merger negotiations?
   A: The upcoming South African national election on Wednesday adds an extra layer of political complexity to the situation, as mining minister Gwede Mantashe has expressed opposition to the deal in recent weeks. Additionally, several behind-closed doors meetings between executives from both companies and government leaders have taken place since, which may temper criticism and influence the outcome of negotiations.
