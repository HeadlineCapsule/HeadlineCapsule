# 我的政治敌人的敌人是我的朋友

**美国政界人士在数字资产问题上达成了罕见的共识，国会投票废除美国证券交易委员会（SEC）于 2022 年 3 月推出的一项模糊规则**。员工会计公报 #121（SAB 121）旨在提高加密平台持有用户资产的标准，规定这些资产在资产负债表中应同时作为负债和资产对待，这一举动对金融服务业产生了重大影响。该规则遭到强烈反对，批评人士认为，由于银行的资本费用增加，该规则使得持有加密货币在经济上不可行。加密行业将立法阻力视为一个突破，将其与 20 世纪 30 年代证券法的创建相提并论。然而，最大的赢家可能是**华尔街**，因为传统金融机构发现自己与加密行业立场一致，阻碍银行全面接受加密货币的监管负担开始减轻。政治行动委员会 Fairshake 及其亲加密货币的议程和大量资金进一步加剧了华盛顿对数字资产立法的关注。加密货币和传统金融之间不断演变的动态突显了二者在应对监管挑战和追求增长方面的相互依存关系。

# My political enemy's enemy is my friend

**US politicians have found rare consensus around digital assets, with Congress voting to nullify an obscure rule introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2022**. Staff Accounting Bulletin #121 (SAB 121), intended to improve the patchy standards of crypto platforms holding user assets, stipulated that these assets be treated as both liabilities and assets on balance sheets, a move with significant implications for the financial services industry. The rule has faced strong opposition, with critics arguing it makes holding crypto economically unfeasible due to increased capital charges for banks. The crypto industry sees the legislative pushback as a breakthrough, with comparisons drawn to the creation of securities laws in the 1930s. However, the biggest winner may be **Wall Street**, as traditional financial institutions find themselves aligned with the crypto industry, and the regulatory overhang that has stopped banks from fully embracing crypto begins to lift. The political action committee Fairshake, with its pro-crypto agenda and substantial funding, has further intensified the focus on digital asset legislation in Washington. This evolving dynamic between crypto and traditional finance underscores the interdependence between the two as they navigate regulatory challenges and pursue growth.
