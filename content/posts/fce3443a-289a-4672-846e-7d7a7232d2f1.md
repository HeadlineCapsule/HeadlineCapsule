特朗普在“封口费”审判中全部罪名成立

# 摘要：
唐纳德·特朗普在涉及他涉嫌在 2016 年总统大选前向成人娱乐明星丹尼尔支付“封口费”的审判中被判所有罪名成立。由普通纽约人组成的陪审团在包括财务记录和前特朗普助手霍普·希克斯和前特朗普律师迈克尔·科恩等证人的证词在内的压倒性证据的基础上做出了有罪判决。尽管有这一裁决，但宪法并没有阻止被定罪的罪犯担任美国公职。

# 有趣的问题：

1. 唐纳德·特朗普的上诉过程可能会影响他未来竞选总统吗？
2. 本案对未来政治活动及其处理敏感信息或指控有何影响？
3. 鉴于没有宪法障碍阻止被定罪的罪犯担任公职，选民或法律体系可以采取哪些措施来防止此类个人最初当选总统？

**Summary:**
Donald Trump was found guilty on all counts in a "hush money" trial related to his alleged involvement in paying adult entertainment star Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. The jury, consisting of everyday New Yorkers, convicted him based on overwhelming evidence including financial records and testimonies from witnesses like former Trump aide Hope Hicks and ex-Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Despite this verdict, there is no constitutional barrier preventing a convicted criminal from holding office in the US.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. How might Donald Trump'cu appeal process affect his potential candidacy for president? 
2. What implications does this trial have on future political campaigns and their handling of sensitive information or allegations?
3. Considering that there is no constitutional barrier to a convicted criminal holding office, what measures could be taken by the electorate or legal system to prevent such individuals from being elected president in the first place?
