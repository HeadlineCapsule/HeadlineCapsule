欧洲航天局欲打造自己的“太空探索技术公司”

# **欧洲航天局（ESA）启动商业货运服务计划** 

## 摘要：
**欧洲航天局（ ESA ）仿效 SpaceX 的模式，与两家公司签订合同，即探索公司和泰雷兹阿莱尼亚航天公司，为国际空间站开发商业货物运输服务。每家公司最初获得2500万欧元的资金，以在2028年前建立通往近地轨道的可行商业服务。这一战略基于美国宇航局（NASA）的商业轨道运输服务（COTS）计划，该计划成功地促进了商业航天能力的提升并降低了成本。**

## 有趣的问题：
**Q1: 与 NASA 最初对其商业轨道运输服务 (COTS) 计划的投资相比，ESA 向探索公司和泰雷兹阿莱尼亚航天公司提供的资金有多少？**  
**A1: 欧洲航天局为该货运车辆挑战赛的第一阶段拨款7500万欧元，这与美国宇航局最初的资金投入相比规模较小。2006年，NASA在其COTS计划下向两家公司授予了4亿多美元的合同，后来又在两年内同意了价值34亿美元的固定价格合同。**

**Q2: ESA 在空间服务采购方面采用商业方法有何潜在益处？**  
**A2: 通过采用商业方法，ESA 可促进欧洲航天领域的创新和效率，同时降低成本。这一战略还允许 ESA 专注于其核心能力，依靠私营公司提供飞行服务，而不是自己开发火箭和航天器。此外，它还有助于培育一个强大的欧洲商业航天工业。**

**Q3: 根据该计划开发的货运飞船如何适应载人航天或月球任务？**  
**A3: ESA 人类和机器人探索部主任丹尼尔·诺温施旺德（Daniel Neuenschwander）表示，他们希望这些货运飞船具有发展能力。这意味着该技术可以潜在地进行修改，以支持向近地轨道运送机组人员，或者协助从月球门户站返回货物——NASA及其合作伙伴正在开发月球门户站，它将绕月运行。**

**Summary:**  
The European Space Agency (ESA) has initiated its own version of SpaceX by awarding contracts to two companies, The Exploration Company and Thales Alenia Space, for developing commercial cargo services to the International Space Station. Each company received an initial funding of €25mn to build a commercially viable service to low-Earth orbit by 202e8. This strategy is based on NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, which has been successful in fostering commercial spaceflight capabilities and reducing costs.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: How does the funding provided by ESA to The Exploration Company and Thales Alenia Space compare with NASA's initial investment in its Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program?  
A1: The European Space Agency has allocated €75mn for this first phase of the cargo vehicle challenge, which is significantly smaller than NASA's initial funding. In 2006, NASA awarded more than $400mn to two companies under its COTS program and later agreed on fixed-price contracts worth $3.4bn within two years.

Q2: What are the potential benefits of ESA adopting a commercial approach to procurement for space services?  
A2: By embracing a commercial approach, ESA can foster innovation and efficiency in Europe's space sector while reducing costs. This strategy also allows ESA to focus on its core competencies by relying on private companies for flight services rather than developing rockets and spacecraft themselves. Additionally, it may help nurture the growth of a robust commercial space industry within Europe.

Q3: How might the cargo vehicles developed under this program be adapted for human spaceflight or lunar missions?  
A3: ESA's director of human and robotic exploration, Daniel Neuenschwander, has mentioned that they aim to have evolution capabilities in these cargo vehicles. This means that the technology could potentially be modified to support crewed transportation to low-Earth orbit or facilitate cargo return from the Lunar Gateway – a space station being developed by NASA and its partners which will orbit the Moon.
