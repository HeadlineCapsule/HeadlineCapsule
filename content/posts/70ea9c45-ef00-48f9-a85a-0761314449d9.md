专家咨询小组建议美国监管机构拒绝将麦角胺用于创伤后应激障碍的治疗

# 美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）咨询委员会投票反对使用麦角胺（MDMA，通常称为摇头丸或派对药物）治疗创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）。

## 要点：

1. **MDMA作为PTSD治疗法**：一家生物科技公司Lykos Therapeutics正在开发基于MDMA的PTSD治疗方法，但在FDA咨询委员会投票反对其有效性和安全性后遭遇挫折。

2. **FDA咨询委员会投票**：该委员会的投票结果是9票对2票反对该治疗无效，10票对1票认为风险大于收益。这些投票虽然不具约束力，但通常会影响FDA的最终决定。

3. **Lykos Therapeutics的回应**：Lykos首席执行官Amy Emerson对投票结果表示失望，并承认该委员会在评估这种治疗方法时面临挑战。

4. **投资和试验**：今年早些时候，Lykos为其基于MDMA的治疗方法从投资者那里筹集了1亿美元。在第三阶段试验中，接受治疗的患者中有71%的人情况有所好转，不再符合PTSD的标准，这与“情绪高涨”和“狂喜”的影响可能影响数据标签。

5. **提出的问题**：FDA小组提出了有关试验设计、数据收集、由于MDMA的致幻作用而出现的双重盲法、心理治疗效果评估以及该治疗可能带来的心血管风险等问题。

6. **对PTSD治疗的影响**：如果获得批准，Lykos的疗法将是20多年来第一个新的PTSD治疗方法，也是第一种被批准用于精神健康调节治疗的1类药物。

 **Article Summary:**  
The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) advisory committee has voted against using MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy or a party drug, for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The panel of mental health and medical experts concluded that the available data did not prove its effectiveness in combination with therapy.

**Key Points:**  
1. **MDMA as PTSD treatment:** A biotech company, Lykos Therapeutics, was developing MDMA-based therapy for PTSD but faced a setback after the FDA advisory committee voted against its effectiveness and safety.
2. **FDA Advisory Committee Votes:** The panel's votes were 9 to 2 on ineffective treatment and 10 to 1 on risks outweighing benefits, which are non-binding but typically influence the FDA's final decision.
3. **Lykos Therapeutics Response:** Amy Emerson, CEO of Lykos, expressed disappointment in the vote results and acknowledged the challenges faced by the committee while evaluating this therapeutic approach.
4. **Investments and Trials:** Earlier this year, Lykos raised $100 million from investors for its MDMA-based therapy treatment. In a phase 3 trial, 71% of patients who received the treatment improved sufficiently to no longer meet PTSD criteria compared with amoled mood" and "euphoria," which could impact data labeling.
5. **Concerns Raised:** The FDA panel cited issues with trial design, data collection, double-blinding due to MDMA's hallucinatory effects, assessment of psychotherapy effectiveness, and potential cardiology risks from the treatment.
6. **Implications for PTSD Treatment:** If approved, Lykos's therapy would have been the first new PTSD treatment in over two decades and marked the approval of a Schedule 1 drug as a regulated mental health treatment.
