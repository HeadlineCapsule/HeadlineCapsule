海地将接待第一批肯尼亚官员，旨在平息帮派暴力。

肯尼亚警方首次部署将于周二出发前往海地，以努力平息帮派暴力并加强该加勒比国家的警察力量。这标志着长期停滞的国际特派任务——海地多国安全支持特派团（MSS）的开始，该特派团去年7月被联合国授权，由1000名肯尼亚警察领导。

肯尼亚总统威廉·鲁托向出发的警察发表讲话，强调了他们在为受帮派暴力影响的人们带来救济和海地稳定方面所发挥的作用。自2021年7月总统若弗内尔·莫伊兹（Jovenel Moïse）遇刺以来，该国国家警察部队一直在与大约200个帮派作斗争，导致今年早些时候临时政府崩溃。

由肯尼亚领导的这项任务预计将带来约2500名来自巴巴多斯、牙买加、乍得和孟加拉国等加勒比和非洲国家的额外警察。美国国务院对部署消息表示欢迎，希望在安全方面取得切实进展，特别是在人道主义援助和核心经济活动准入方面。

尽管今年早些时候面临法律挑战并被肯尼亚高等法院阻止，但鲁托总统与海地官员于3月签署双边协议后成功推动了这项任务。然而，分析人士和外交官警告说，由于该国以前的干预行动未能防止暴力死灰复燃，因此该任务存在风险。

 **Summary of Article:**  
The first deployment of Kenyan police officers is set to depart for Haiti as early as Tuesday in an effort to quell gang violence and bolster the Caribbean nation's outmatched police force. This marks the beginning of a long-stalled international task force known as the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti (MSS), which was authorized by the UN last July with 1,000 officers led by Kenya.

Kenyan President William Ruto addressed the departing officers and emphasized their role in bringing relief to those affected by gang violence and working towards stability in Haiti. The country's national police force has struggled against approximately 200 gangs that have grown since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021, leading to a collapse of the interim government earlier this year.

The Kenya-led mission is expected to bring about 2,500 additional officers from various Caribbean and African nations, including Barbados, Jamaica, Chad, and Bangladesh. The US state department welcomed the news of the deployment, hoping for measurable improvements in security, particularly with respect to access to humanitarian aid and core economic activity.

Despite facing legal challenges and a block by Kenya's high court earlier this year, President Ruto managed to push through after signing a bilateral agreement with Haitian officials in March. However, analysts and diplomats warn that the mission is risky due to previous interventions in the country doing little to prevent violence resurgence.
