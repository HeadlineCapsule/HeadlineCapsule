# **中国**采取措施重振陷入困境的房地产行业

**中国** 宣布了重大措施来重振陷入困境的房地产行业，该行业一直是中国经济担忧的来源。现在，地方政府被允许购买住宅项目用于公共住房，并从开发商手中购买土地。**央行** 也放宽了对首次购房者的贷款要求。在采取这些措施的同时，中国经济信号喜忧参半，零售销售额增长低于预期，但工业生产，尤其是 **高科技** 行业的生产超出了预期。同时，中国与关键出口市场 **美国** 和 **欧盟** 之间的关系紧张，这是由于中国在工业上侧重于高科技和人工智能发展造成的。此外，中国与 **俄罗斯** 之间深化的军事关系和共同的反美言论也引起了西方的担忧。

# China moves to revive stricken property sector 

**China** has announced significant measures to revive its struggling property sector, which has been a source of economic concern. Local governments are now permitted to purchase residential projects for public housing and buy land from developers. The **central bank** has also relaxed lending requirements for first-time homebuyers. These moves come amidst mixed economic signals, with retail sales rising less than expected but industrial production, particularly in **high-tech** sectors, exceeding forecasts. The country is also facing tensions with the **US** and **EU**, its key export markets, due to its industrial focus on high-tech and AI development. Meanwhile, China's relationship with **Russia** is causing concern in the West, with deepening military ties and joint rhetoric against the US.
