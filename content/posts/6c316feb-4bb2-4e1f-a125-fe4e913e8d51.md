# 俄罗斯和乌克兰：两个交战国的经济

**俄罗斯** 政府近期的**改组**，包括任命安德烈·贝洛索夫（Andrei Belousov）为国防部长，突显了**弗拉基米尔·普京** 对**军事化** 的重视，以及他继续在**乌克兰** 战争直到达成目标的意图。改组还表明，**寡头** 和**国防工业** 在俄罗斯政府中的影响力日益增长。尽管受到了西方制裁的影响，俄罗斯的经济正变得越来越**军事化**，越来越多的**军工企业** 和相关行业从战争中受益。**中国** 仍然是一个关键的经济伙伴，双边贸易正在增长。同时，战争也对普通俄罗斯家庭造成了影响，俄罗斯中央银行也担心经济**过热**。

另一方面，**乌克兰** 严重依赖西方的经济和军事援助来维持其经济，而农业这一关键优势却受到了俄罗斯袭击的影响。乌克兰外交部引入**人工智能生成的发言人** 也凸显了该国在国防努力中对技术的接受。乌克兰最近的政府改组，包括解雇了一名以对西方盟友透明和合作而闻名的部长，这引发了支持者们的担忧。

# Russia and Ukraine: two economies at war

**Russia's** recent **government reshuffle**, including the appointment of Andrei Belousov as defence minister, underscores **Vladimir Putin's** focus on **militarisation** and his intention to continue the war in **Ukraine** for as long as needed to achieve his goals. The reshuffle also highlights the growing influence of **oligarchs** and the **defence industry** in the Russian government. Despite the impact of Western sanctions, Russia's economy is becoming increasingly **militarised**, with a growing number of **military-industrial enterprises** and related industries benefiting from the war. **China** remains a key economic partner, with bilateral trade increasing. Meanwhile, the war is taking a toll on average Russian families, and the central bank is concerned about **overheating**. 

On the other hand, **Ukraine** is heavily reliant on Western financial and military aid to keep its economy afloat, with its agricultural sector, a key strength, being targeted by Russian attacks. The introduction of an **AI-generated spokesperson** for Ukraine's foreign ministry highlights the country's embrace of technology in its defence efforts. Ukraine's recent government reshuffle, which included the dismissal of a minister known for his transparency and cooperation with Western allies, has raised concerns among its backers.
