根据计划，顾问将失去英国政府30亿英镑的工作，以削减一半的咨询支出。

**文章摘要：**

英国两大政党均承诺，在下一届议会期间将政府对外部咨询公司的支出削减一半。预计此举将在五年内节省约30亿英镑，因为自上次选举以来，由于Covid-19紧急计划和数字化转型项目，咨询公司使用已达到创纪录水平。

**关键点：**

- 保守党和工党都在其宣言中承诺将对外部咨询公司的依赖减少50%。
- 预计这种削减将在未来五年内节省大约30亿英镑，两党都旨在重新分配资金用于前线公共服务的交付。
- 批评者认为，过度使用顾问浪费了资金，并阻碍了英国公务员系统内部技能的发展。
- 工党估计，通过将外部顾问支出减半，每年可节省7.45亿英镑（五年内总计37.3亿英镑），而保守党的计算预测到2029年净节省额为30.4亿英镑。
- 保守党还计划对平等、多样性和包容性倡议实施控制，并将公务员恢复到疫情前的规模，这可能导致近9万个就业岗位被削减。
- 咨询公司辩称，与政府部门全职雇佣专家相比，他们的服务在短期项目上更具成本效益。

**咨询使用和影响：**

自上次选举以来，八家主要咨询公司获得了71亿英镑的公共部门合同。批评者警告说，过度依赖外部顾问阻碍了公务员系统内部技能的发展，并浪费了纳税人的钱。然而，支持使用顾问的人认为，与在政府部门全职保留专家相比，他们为短期项目提供了更具成本效益的解决方案。

**政府的努力：**

英国政府之前试图减少对外部顾问的依赖，包括在上一届议会期间创建了一个内部咨询机构，但最终被废除，因为该机构失败了，并且更倾向于使用各部门内的外部顾问。

 **Article Summary:** 

Both major UK political parties have pledged to cut government spending on external advisory firms by half over the next parliament term. This move is expected to save around £3bn over five years, as consulting firm usage has reached record levels since the last election due to Covid-19 emergency schemes and digital transformation projects.

**Key Points:**

- The Conservatives and Labour have made manifesto commitments to reduce reliance on external advisory firms by 50%.
- This reduction is projected to save approximately £3bn over the next five years, with both parties aiming to reallocate funds towards frontline public service delivery.
- Critics argue that excessive use of consultants wastes money and hinders skill development within the UK's civil service.
- Labour estimates a yearly saving of £745mn (£3.73bn over five years) by halving spending on external advisors, while Conservative calculations forecast net savings of £3.04bn by 2029.
- The Conservatives also plan to introduce controls on equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives and return the civil service to its pre-pandemic size, potentially leading to nearly 90,000 job cuts.
- Consulting firms argue that their services are more cost-effective for short-term projects compared to employing specialists within government departments full time.

**Consultant Usage and Impact:**

Since the last election, eight major consulting companies have been awarded £7.1bn in public sector contracts. Critics warn that overreliance on external advisors prevents skill development within the civil service and wastes taxpayer money. However, proponents of using consultants argue they provide cost-effective solutions for short-term projects compared to maintaining specialists full time within government departments.

**Government's Efforts:**

Previous attempts by the UK government to reduce reliance on external advisors include creating an in-house consultancy arm during the last parliament, which was ultimately scrapped due to its failure and preference for using external advisers within departments.
