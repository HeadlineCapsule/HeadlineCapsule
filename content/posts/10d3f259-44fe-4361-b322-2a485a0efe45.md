#欧盟同意用俄罗斯国有资产收益向乌克兰提供武器

**段落 1**

**欧盟大使同意使用俄罗斯被冻结国有资产产生的约 30 亿欧元的收益** 为乌克兰联合购买武器，这是一个重大进展。该决定针对的是 **比利时中央证券存管机构** **Euroclear** 的利润，该机构持有约 1900 亿欧元的俄罗斯央行资产。该协议是对俄罗斯 2022 年全面入侵乌克兰的回应，西方国家采取行动冻结了俄罗斯在国外持有的国有资产。

**段落 2**

**欧盟委员会**预计 Euroclear 将每年向欧盟资金转移约 30 亿欧元，首次付款预计将于 7 月进行。该措施将适用于从 2024 年 2 月中旬开始累积的利润。资金分配将采取**90/10 分成**，大部分用于购买武器和军事装备，其余部分将用于支持重建工作。这一折衷方案解决了军事中立的欧盟国家所关注的问题，确保了一部分利润将用于非军事目的。

**段落 3**

在经过数月的讨论后，决定利用冻结资产收益标志着谨慎地向前迈进了一步。此前，一些更激进的提议被否决，例如没收约 2600 亿欧元的俄罗斯境外冻结国有资产，该提议由于潜在的法律和金融影响而遭到德国、意大利和法国的抵制。

**段落 4**

在另一项进展中，**美国提议为乌克兰发行 500 亿美元的债务**，并建议可以用俄罗斯国有资产的未来收益来偿还。然而，欧盟认为该计划过于复杂且耗时，优先考虑尽快向乌克兰提供资金。

**段落 5**

自入侵乌克兰以来，Euroclear 从俄罗斯资产中获得了约 50 亿欧元的净利润。尽管截至 2024 年 2 月中旬的利润仍将由 Euroclear 持有作为应对法律索赔的缓冲，该公司还将保留一小部分未来利润（0.3%）作为激励费，并暂时扣留 10% 以确保金融稳定，这部分资金最终将转给欧盟。

**段落 6**

对 Euroclear 的利润征税的比利时，从该存管处俄罗斯资产持有量中获得了大量收入。亚历山大·德克罗总理表示，比利时已将战争开始以来的约 16 亿欧元的税收收入用于“与乌克兰相关的支出”。2024 年，比利时预计将从 Euroclear 的俄罗斯资产利润中获得 17 亿欧元的税收收入，其中 10 亿欧元将用于对基辅的军事援助。

**段落 7**

面对美国和欧盟伙伴放弃此项税收收入的压力，比利时表示从 2025 年起，愿意就俄罗斯资产利润的公司税收入达成“自愿协议”。德克罗总理强调，此类协议应与其他持有类似资产的欧盟和七国集团伙伴协调进行，并表示这将大大增加对乌克兰的财政支持。

# EU agrees to arm Ukraine using profits from Russian state assets

**Paragraph 1** 

In a significant development, **EU ambassadors have agreed to use an estimated €3 billion in profits from Russia's frozen state assets** to jointly purchase weapons for Ukraine. This decision targets the profits made by **Belgium's central securities depository**, **Euroclear**, which holds approximately €190 billion of Russian central bank assets. The agreement comes as a response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Western nations taking action to immobilize Russian state assets abroad. 

**Paragraph 2** 

The **European Commission** anticipates that Euroclear will transfer about €3 billion annually to the bloc's funds, with the first payout expected as early as July. This measure will apply to profits accrued from mid-February 2024 onwards. The funds will be allocated with a **90/10 split**, utilizing the majority for buying arms and military equipment, while the remaining portion will support reconstruction efforts. This compromise addresses the concerns of militarily neutral EU countries, ensuring that a portion of the profits is directed towards non-military purposes. 

**Paragraph 3** 

The decision to use frozen asset profits marks a cautious step forward, following months of discussion. It comes after the dismissal of more radical proposals, such as the confiscation of approximately €260 billion in underlying Russian state assets immobilized abroad, an idea that faced resistance from Germany, Italy, and France due to potential legal and financial repercussions. 

**Paragraph 4** 

In a separate development, the **US has proposed issuing $50 billion in debt for Ukraine**, suggesting that this could be repaid using future profits from Russian state assets. However, the EU views this plan as overly complex and time-consuming, prioritizing the need to get funds to Ukraine swiftly. 

**Paragraph 5** 

Since the invasion, Euroclear has generated about €5 billion in net profits from Russian assets. While profits up until mid-February 2024 will remain with Euroclear as a buffer against legal claims, the company will also retain a small portion of future profits (0.3%) as an incentive fee and temporarily hold back 10% for financial stability, which will eventually be transferred to the EU. 

**Paragraph 6** 

Belgium, which taxes Euroclear's profits, has earned significant revenue from the depository's Russian asset holdings. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo stated that Belgium has allocated revenues from these taxes, amounting to approximately €1.6 billion since the start of the war, towards "Ukraine-related expenses". In 2024, Belgium expects to generate €1.7 billion in tax revenue from Euroclear's Russian asset profits, with €1 billion earmarked for military aid to Kyiv. 

**Paragraph 7** 

Facing pressure from the US and EU partners to forgo this tax income, Belgium has indicated its openness to a "voluntary arrangement" regarding corporate tax revenue from Russian asset profits starting in 2025. Prime Minister De Croo emphasized that such an arrangement should be done in coordination with other EU and G7 partners holding similar assets, expressing confidence that this could substantially enhance financial support for Ukraine.
