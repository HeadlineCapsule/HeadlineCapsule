测量很重要。

**国际清算银行（BIS）警告称，为抑制通胀，央行可能需要将利率提高至超出此前预期的高水平。该机构强调了工资-价格螺旋式上升带来的风险。尽管有迹象表明物价压力已经见顶且供应链问题有所缓解，但 BIS 指出劳动力市场依然紧张，工资增长迅速**。它认为，如果这种情况持续或恶化，就需要更积极地收紧货币政策，以防止通胀预期失控。

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that central banks may need to raise interest rates further than previously expected in order to curb inflation, as it highlighted risks from a potential wage-price spiral. The BIS noted that while there are signs that price pressures have peaked and supply chain issues are easing, the labour market remains tight with wages rising rapidly. It argued that monetary policy needs to be tightened more aggressively if this situation persists or worsens, in order to prevent inflation expectations becoming unanchored.
