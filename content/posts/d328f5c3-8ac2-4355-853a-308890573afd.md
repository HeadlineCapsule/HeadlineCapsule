纽约“无限期”暂停曼哈顿拥堵收费计划

**纽约曼哈顿拥堵收费方案无限期暂停**

纽约市市长霍赫尔（Kathy Hochul）无限期暂停了纽约市的拥堵收费计划，这让人们对该城市公共交通系统预期获得的数十亿美元资金感到不确定。做出这一决定是因为担心在新冠肺炎疫情缓慢恢复和普通市民高昂成本的背景下，这一举措会对纽约人产生意想不到的后果。

该拥堵收费计划以伦敦和斯德哥尔摩类似的方案为模型，旨在通过向驾驶员收取约15美元进入曼哈顿60街以下的某些地区的费用来减少交通并改善空气质量。预计该政策将在四年内为大都会运输局（MTA）筹集约150亿美元。

该计划面临来自政客的反对，包括代表杰罗尔德·纳德勒（Jerrold Nadler）和前州长安德鲁·库莫（Andrew Cuomo）的继任者霍赫尔（Kathy Hochul）。它还引起了邻国新泽西的强烈抗议和法律挑战，因为人们担心这会对通勤到纽约市的居民造成不公平的税收负担。

现在该计划被搁置，MTA将需要寻找替代资金来源，或者可能削减服务。据报道，霍赫尔州长正在考虑提高工资税作为解决方案。这一决定引起了一些方面的失望，例如纽约市伙伴关系的凯瑟琳·怀尔德（Kathryn Wylde），她表示希望延迟是暂时的。

 **New York's Manhattan Congestion Pricing Scheme Paused Indefinitely**

The New York City congestion pricing plan has been indefinitely paused by Governor Kathy Hochul, casting uncertainty over billions of dollars expected to fund the city'amoor public transit system. The decision was made due to concerns about unintended consequences for New Yorkers amidst a slow recovery from the Covid pandemic and high costs weighing on ordinary citizens.

The congestion pricing plan, modeled after similar schemes in London and Stockholm, aimed to reduce traffic and improve air quality by charging drivers approximately $15 to enter certain areas of Manhattan below 60th Street. The policy was expected to raise an estimated $15 billion over a four-year period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).

The plan faced opposition from politicians, including Representative Jerrold Nadler and former Governor Andrew Cuomo's successor, Kathy Hochul. It also drew sharp protests and legal challenges from neighboring New Jersey due to concerns about being an unfair tax on residents commuting into New York City.

With the plan now on hold, the MTA will need to find alternative funding sources or potentially cut services. Governor Hochul is reportedly considering an increase in payroll taxes as a solution. The decision has been met with disappointment from some quarters, such as Kathryn Wylde of the Partnership for New York City, who expressed hope that the delay would be temporary.
