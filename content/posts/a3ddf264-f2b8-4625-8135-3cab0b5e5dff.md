# **购买回一些国债市场流动性** 

**Redburn Atlantic首席经济学家梅丽莎·戴维斯** 分析了美联储最近缩减量化紧缩规模和美国财政部回购债券的决定，以解决对国债市场流动性的担忧。美国政府的赤字和飙升的债务发行量加剧了人们对潜在市场动荡的担忧。 **雷·达里奥** 强调了对高债务水平和需求软化的担忧，尤其是来自国际买家的需求。美联储缩减量化紧缩和减少国债到期不续的举措将缓解债券市场的压力，而财政部的回购旨在增强流动性和现金管理操作。

这些操作的最高运行速度将达到 **每月200亿美元**，首次回购计划于 **5月29日** 进行。财政部强调，回购不会被用于平息市场动荡，但预计其稳定的购买行为将稳定美国政府债券市场。这不是 **量化宽松**，因为它没有净增加流动性，但它降低了流动性风险。财政部充当了 **难以变现债券的最后市场造价者**，潜在成本包括缩短债务期限和曲线长端的下行压力。

截至年底，这些努力的成功将影响 **2025年1月** 下一轮债务上限谈判。 "更高的长时间" 通胀环境和潜在的减税或关税强调了稳定市场造价者对流动性较差国债的重要性。

# Buying back some Treasury market liquidity 

**Melissa Davies, chief economist at Redburn Atlantic,** analyzes the Federal Reserve's recent decision to scale back quantitative tightening and the US Treasury's plan to buy back bonds, addressing concerns about Treasury market liquidity. The US government deficit and soaring debt issuance have heightened worries about a potential market upset. **Ray Dalio** highlights concerns about high debt levels and softening demand, especially from international buyers. The Fed's move to taper QT and reduce Treasury runoff will ease pressure on the bond market, while the Treasury's buybacks aim to enhance liquidity and cash management operations. 

The maximum run rate of these operations will be **$20 billion per month**, with the first buyback scheduled for **May 29**. The Treasury stresses that purchases won't be used to calm market stress, but their steady buying is expected to stabilize the US government bond market. This isn't **QE**, as there's no net liquidity addition, but it reduces liquidity risk. The Treasury acts as a **market maker of last resort** for illiquid bonds, with potential costs including shorter debt maturity and downward pressure on the long end of the curve. 

The success of these efforts until the end of the year will influence another round of debt ceiling negotiations in **January 2025**. The "higher for longer" inflation environment and potential tax cuts or tariffs underscore the importance of a stable market maker for less liquid Treasuries.
