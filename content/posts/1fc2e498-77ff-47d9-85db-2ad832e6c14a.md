## **雷西意外身亡，伊朗政权遭受打击**

**伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱西**在直升机坠毁事故中意外身亡，这震动了该国的政治格局，特别是**最高领袖阿亚图拉·阿里·哈梅内伊**巩固**强硬派**权力和确保平稳领导层交接的计划。虽然莱西的总统任期面临经济困境和不受欢迎的问题，但他被认为是哈梅内伊的关键盟友和潜在继任者。他的去世迫使哈梅内伊和其他权力经纪人紧急为即将到来的选举做准备，而哈梅内伊的儿子**穆杰塔巴**现在成为潜在的领先者。虽然莱西的去世不会改变伊朗的政策（因为政策由哈梅内伊决定），但它确实去掉了哈梅内伊的**一个忠实拥护者**，并对政权的稳定形象提出了挑战，尤其是在反政权抗议和与西方和以色列紧张局势的背景下。为了确保强硬派继任者的趋势可能会继续下去，伊朗可能会维持其微妙的平衡，即支持代理人冲突，同时避免直接的区域战争。

# President Ebrahim Raisi’s Death Deals Blow to Iranian Regime 

The unexpected death of **Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi** in a helicopter crash has shaken the country's political landscape, particularly the plans of **Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** to solidify the power of **hardliners** and ensure a smooth leadership transition. While Raisi's presidency was marked by economic troubles and unpopularity, he was seen as a key ally of Khamenei and a potential successor. His death forces Khamenei and other power brokers to quickly prepare for the upcoming election, with the son of the Supreme Leader, **Mojtaba**, now a possible frontrunner. The loss of Raisi will not alter Iran's policies, as these are determined by Khamenei, but it does remove a **loyal figurehead** and presents a challenge to the regime's image of stability, especially amid anti-regime protests and tensions with the West and Israel. The trend of sacrificing democratic credibility to secure a hardliner successor is likely to persist, and Iran will probably maintain its delicate balance of supporting proxy conflicts while avoiding direct regional war.
