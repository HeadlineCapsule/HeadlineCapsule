# 更完善的英美资源集团防御策略：出售优质资产，保留劣质资产

**英美资源集团**（**Anglo American**）是一家矿业公司，其**伍德史密斯**（**Woodsmith**）项目（一个**英国钾盐开采**风险投资）遭到了分析师和股东的批评和不满。该项目前身名为**星辰矿业**（**Sirius Minerals**），一直备受争议，包括对收购价格和项目成本不断上升的争议。尽管承认其长期潜力，英美资源集团仍计划放缓对伍德史密斯的投资，旨在削减 2025 年的资本开支，并在 2026 年停止投资，以支持**资产负债表去杠杆化**。该决定向市场发出了负面信号，并意味着对该项目价值主张的不确定性。

该公司其他主要业务包括**铜**和**铁矿石**，这些业务更受股东青睐。然而，英美资源集团出售或剥离这些热门资产的计划复杂而可能并非最佳解决方案。一个激进的解决方案是出售这些受欢迎的资产，并鼓励股东离开。该策略可以释放大量价值，在不同的金属价格情景下，潜在的股权价值估计为 270 亿至 310 亿美元。

尽管存在争议，但英美资源集团仍将伍德史密斯项目描述为“**一级资源**”，并称其“按计划、按预算**”**进行。该项目旨在应对**粮食安全**问题，并增加**作物产量**和**改善土壤健康**。尽管英美资源集团的传统解决方案是出售或剥离不受欢迎的资产，但出售受欢迎资产的非传统方法可能是一种可行的防御策略，可以潜在地维护该公司的企业独立性。

# A better Anglo American defence: sell the good bit, keep the bad bits 

**Anglo American**, a mining company, is facing criticism and irritation from analysts and shareholders regarding its **Woodsmith** project, a **UK potash mining** venture. The project, formerly known as **Sirius Minerals**, has a history of controversies, including disputes over its takeover price and increasing project costs. Despite recognizing its long-term potential, Anglo American plans to slow investment in Woodsmith, aiming to reduce Capex in 2025 and halt it in 2026 to support **balance sheet deleveraging**. This decision sends a negative signal to the market and implies uncertainty about the project's value case. 

The company's other key businesses include **copper** and **iron ore**, which are considered more favorable by shareholders. However, Anglo American's plan to spin off or sell these popular assets is complicated and may not be the best solution. Instead, a proposed radical solution is to sell the well-liked assets and encourage shareholders to depart. This strategy could unlock significant value, with potential equity values estimated at $27-31 billion under different metal price scenarios. 

The Woodsmith project, though controversial, is described by Anglo American as a "Tier 1 resource" that is "on plan and on budget." It is positioned as a response to **food security** concerns and the need to increase **crop yield** and **improve soil health**. While Anglo American's conventional solution is to sell or starve unpopular assets, the more unconventional approach of selling the favored assets could be a viable defense strategy, potentially preserving the company's corporate independence.
