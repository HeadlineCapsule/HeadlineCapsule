# 低油价挡不住原油运输船市场的繁荣

尽管**低油价**持续，但原油运输船市场一片繁荣，**日点租金**高企，新建油轮订单的**市场**一片大好。这导致油轮**供不应求**，造船厂**订单积压**，包括**液化天然气**和**双燃料**集装箱船在内的各类船只订单都在排队等待建造。平均年龄为 13 岁的**老龄油轮船队**也推动了对新油轮的需求。

新油轮的**交货期**已延长至三年或更长时间，而**造船能力**又十分稀缺。像约翰·弗雷德里克森（John Fredriksen）这样提前预见到油轮短缺的**船东**从中获利，原油运输公司的**股价**也随之上涨。海上原油运输量保持稳定，但油轮船东因油轮速度放缓和需求增加而**收益**，利润达到自**2000年代末**以来的最高水平。

# Low oil prices can't stop the crude tanker boom 

Despite **low oil prices**, the crude tanker market is booming, with high **daily spot rates** and a bull market for **new-build orders**. This has led to a **supply squeeze** for oil tankers, with **shipbuilders** facing a backlog of orders for various types of vessels, including **liquefied natural gas** and **dual-fuel container ships**. The **aging oil tanker fleet**, with an average age of 13 years, is also contributing to the demand for new tankers. 

**Lead times** for new tankers have extended to three or more years, and **shipbuilding capacity** is scarce. **Shipowners** who anticipated this shortage, such as John Fredriksen, have profited, with **share prices** of crude shipping groups surging. While **seaborne crude volumes** remain stable, **tanker owners** are benefiting from slow tanker speeds and higher demand, resulting in their highest profits since the **late 2000s**.
