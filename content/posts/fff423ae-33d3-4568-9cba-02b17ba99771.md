# 阿尔斯通计划通过10亿欧元的权益发行来减少债务

**阿尔斯通**（Alstom)，这家以生产法国高速**TGV**列车闻名的法国火车制造商，已宣布计划筹资10亿欧元以减少债务。该公司是全球第二大**火车制造商**，其目标是将债务减少20亿欧元，以避免降级至**垃圾级**。阿尔斯通已确定7亿欧元的资产处置计划，并拟发行**混合债券**来实现这一目标。在经历了包括**现金流警告**和庞巴迪公司遗留合同问题在内的艰难时期后，阿尔斯通做出了这一决定。在警告发出后，阿尔斯通的股价曾下跌，但今年已显露复苏迹象。

阿尔斯通公司首席执行官亨利·**浦帕特-拉法基**（Henri Poupart-Lafarge）将推迟筹资计划的原因归结为，他们希望首先在改善自由现金流和加快火车交付速度方面取得进展。阿尔斯通上一财年的自由现金流为负5亿至7.5亿欧元，但预计下一财年将转为正数，达到3亿至6亿欧元。大部分资产出售将来自处置一家北美信号公司的业务，价值6.3亿欧元。阿尔斯通的两大股东CDPQ和Bpifrance已承诺按比例参与筹资。

此外，阿尔斯通在英国德比的火车制造中心也面临着挑战，由于英国政府临时订购，大规模裁员计划被叫停。浦帕特-拉法基承认，虽然这提供了暂时的缓解，但仍然需要更大的长期订单来确保工厂的未来。该公司还正在与英国出口融资机构就国际铁路的新订单进行谈判。阿尔斯通专注于减少债务和改善运营，反映了其谨慎的方法，以确保长期成功扭转局面。

# Train maker Alstom plans €1bn rights issue to trim debt 

**Alstom**, the French train manufacturer known for producing France's high-speed TGVs, has announced a capital raise of €1 billion to reduce its debt. The company, ranked as the **second-largest train maker** globally, aims to decrease its debt by €2 billion to avoid a downgrade to **junk status**. Alstom has already identified €700 million in asset disposals and plans to issue a **hybrid bond** to achieve this goal. This decision comes after a challenging period for the company, including a **cash flow warning** and issues with contracts inherited from Bombardier. Alstom's share price slumped following the warning but has shown signs of recovery this year.

The company's CEO, Henri **Poupart-Lafarge**, attributed the delay in the capital raise to their desire to first demonstrate progress in improving free cash flow and speeding up train deliveries. Alstom's free cash flow for the previous year was negative, between €500-€750 million, but is projected to turn positive in the next financial year, reaching €300-€600 million. The majority of the asset sales will come from the disposal of a North American signaling business for €630 million. Alstom's two largest shareholders, CDPQ and Bpifrance, have committed to participating in the capital raise pro-rata.

Additionally, Alstom has been navigating challenges at its UK train manufacturing hub in Derby, where mass job cuts were averted due to a provisional order from the UK government. Poupart-Lafarge acknowledged that while this provides some relief, larger, long-term orders are necessary to secure the factory's future. The company is also in talks with UK Export Finance regarding potential new orders for international railways. Alstom's focus on debt reduction and operational improvements reflects a cautious approach to ensure a successful long-term turnaround.
