英国首批加密货币交易所交易产品将于5月28日推出

## 摘要： 

英国即将于5月推出首份加密货币**交易所交易产品（ETP）**，这是继 **金融行为监管局（FCA）**批准 WisdomTree 和 21Shares 上市投资“实物”现货比特币和以太坊的 ETP 之后进行的。然而，由于担心加密衍生品不适合零售消费者，这些 ETP 仅向专业投资者开放。该文章还强调了英国与其他国家的对比，其他国家允许面向零售和机构投资者的加密货币 ETP。

## 有趣的问题： 

**Q1:全球各大证券交易所（交易所）在加密货币交易所交易产品（ETP）的监管方面有何关键差异？**

**A1:** 一些国家/地区，如欧洲大陆、澳大利亚、巴西、加拿大、香港和美国，允许面向零售和机构投资者的加密货币 ETP。而英国采取了更为保守的方法，由于担心加密衍生品对零售消费者的潜在伤害，该国仅允许专业投资者访问这些产品。

**Q2:只向专业投资者提供加密货币 ETP 是否会影响该资产类别在英国的机构采用和兴趣？**

 **A2:** 该文章表明，FCA 的批准可能导致更多机构采用加密资产，因为许多专业投资者之前因监管限制而无法接触这些资产。WisdomTree 欧洲区负责人认为，为英国的专业投资者提供更便利的接入点将鼓励他们向加密货币分配资金。

**Q3:考虑到对零售投资者的禁令以及机构投资者已有的兴趣，在伦敦推出加密货币 ETP 有何潜在影响？**

 **A3:** 尽管存在针对零售投资者的禁令，但发行人仍希望英国专业投资者能有足够的兴趣，使交叉上市其 ETP 成为值得做的事情。文章指出，超过90家机构投资者在美国上市的现货比特币ETF中持有股份，表明即使在零售禁令下，交易所交易债券（ETN）仍然存在潜在受众。此外，WisdomTree英国销售主管报告说，从参加他们加密资产网络研讨会的机构投资者那里收到了大量兴趣。

## Summary:
The article discusses the upcoming launch of the UK's first cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) on May ablishment, with WisdomTree and 21Shares receiving approval from the Financial Conduct Authority to list ETPs investing in "physical" spot bitcoin and ether. However, these ETPs will only be available to professional investors due to concerns about crypto derivatives being ill-suited for retail consumers. The article also highlights the contrast between the UK's approach and that of other countries offering crypto ETPs to both retail and institutional investors.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What are the key differences in regulatory approaches towards cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) among various global stock exchanges?
A1: The article highlights that while some countries, such as continental Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, and the US, offer crypto ETPs to both retail and institutional investors, the UK has taken a more conservative approach. In the UK, only professional investors will have access to these products due to concerns about potential harm posed by crypto derivatives to retail consumers.

Q2: How might the availability of cryptocurrency ETPs exclusively for professional investors impact institutional adoption and interest in the asset class within the UK?
A2: The article suggests that FCA approval could result in greater institutional adoption of crypto assets, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure due to regulatory limitations. WisdomTree's head of Europe believes that providing a more convenient access point for UK-based professional investors will encourage them to allocate funds towards cryptocurrencies.

Q3: What are the potential implications of launching crypto ETPs in London, considering the retail investor ban and existing interest among institutional investors?
A3: Despite the retail investor ban, issuers remain hopeful that there will be sufficient interest from UK-based professional investors to make cross-listing their ETPs worthwhile. The article notes that more than 90ninstitutional investors have built stakes in US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs and suggests a potential audience for ETNs even with the retail ban. Additionally, WisdomTree's head of UK sales reports significant interest from institutional investors attending their webinars on crypto assets.
