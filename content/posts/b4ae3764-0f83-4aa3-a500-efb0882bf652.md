男人要钱，女人要权。

简要新闻：工作生活的平衡艺术，尤其针对职业女性。文章强调了**超时工作**是一个重大的问题，这往往是无人谈论却会导致不满甚至离职的因素。作者建议，应将反馈意见的重点放在未来的改进上，而不是过去的错误上，从而使反馈更加具有建设性。

此外，对于那些认为自己目前的工作量太少的人，文章提供了几条建议：寻找**观摩学习**的机会、寻找导师或反向指导机会、掌握更多技能并接受培训、参加活动/会议，以及主动提高自己在组织中的可见度。作者还谈到了异步工作的未来、工作中的娱乐性、重新审视教育中福祉策略的重要性、跨代使用表情包，以及即将举行的**《金融时报》女性商业论坛**（FT Women in Business Forum），其中将包括一场关于如何**为职业未来做好准备**的专题讨论。

The article discusses various aspects of work-life balance, particularly for women in the professional world. It highlights overwork as a significant issue that often goes unspoken but can lead to dissatisfaction and even prompt individuals to leave their jobs. The author suggests making feedback more constructive by focusing on future improvements rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

Additionally, the article offers advice for those who feel they have too little work in their current roles: seeking opportunities to shadow others, finding a mentor or reverse mentorship, pursuing additional skills and training, attending events/conferences, and being proactive about visibility within the organization. The author also touches on the future of asynchronous work, having fun at work, re-examining wellbeing strategies in education, intergenerational emoji use at work, and an upcoming FT Women in Business Forum event featuring a panel discussion on future-proofing careers.
