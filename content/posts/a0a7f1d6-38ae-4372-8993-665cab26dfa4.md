# 海湾地区Waitrose品牌运营商Spinneys在迪拜上市首日飙升

**Spinneys** 是海湾地区经营**Waitrose** 品牌的知名**高端杂货商**，其在迪拜证券交易所首次公开募股（**IPO**）获得成功，上市首日股价上涨高达 10%。该公司以一位名为 Arthur Rawdon Spinney 的**英国军官兼商人**命名，其IPO认购额超过了发行量的64倍，吸引了众多投资者关注。这一成功吸引了考虑类似上市的其他私营公司，银行家们也希望这能鼓励更多私营实体，尤其是大型**家族企业**，进入中东金融中心迪拜。Spinneys 的 IPO 筹集了 14 亿迪拉姆（合 3.75 亿美元），市值为 55 亿迪拉姆（合 15 亿美元），这是迪拜和阿布扎比经济多元化计划的一部分，旨在通过增加上市公司数量来吸引投资者。这家杂货商的强劲表现也归功于迪拜上市股票种类较少，为投资者提供了押注该地区人口增长和经济前景的方式。Spinneys 历史悠久，可追溯至 1961 年，目前在阿联酋和阿曼经营 75 家门店，主要服务于外籍人士和高端消费者。该公司还计划扩张至沙特阿拉伯，但其合作伙伴 Waitrose 由于物流挑战以及专注于英国市场的扩张，选择不进入沙特市场。

# Gulf Waitrose brand operator Spinneys jumps on first day of Dubai trading 

**Spinneys**, the well-known **high-end grocer** operating the **Waitrose** brand in the Gulf region, experienced a successful initial public offering (**IPO**) on the Dubai stock exchange, with shares rising up to 10% on the first day of trading. The company, named after a **British army officer turned merchant**, Arthur Rawdon Spinney, attracted significant investor interest with its offering being 64 times oversubscribed. This success has caught the attention of other private companies considering similar listings, and bankers hope it will encourage more private sector entities, particularly large, **family-owned businesses**, to enter the Middle East's financial hub of Dubai. Spinneys' IPO raised Dh1.4bn ($375mn), with a market capitalization of Dh5.5bn ($1.5bn), and is part of a broader trend of economic diversification plans in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, aiming to attract investors by increasing the number of listed companies. The grocer's strong performance is also attributed to the narrow range of stocks listed in Dubai, providing investors with a way to bet on the region's population growth and economic prospects. With a history dating back to 1961, Spinneys now operates 75 stores catering to expatriates and wealthy shoppers in the UAE and Oman. The company is also expanding into Saudi Arabia, although its partner, Waitrose, has opted not to enter the Saudi market due to logistical challenges and a focus on UK expansion.
