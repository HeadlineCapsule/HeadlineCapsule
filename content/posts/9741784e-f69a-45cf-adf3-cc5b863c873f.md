桥水基金创始人雷•达里奥也加入了在新加坡抢购“店屋”的亿万富翁行列。

## 摘要：

2021 年，亿万富翁雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）的家族办公室以约 2500 新加坡元（1890万美元）的价格在新加坡 Club Street 收购了两栋具有遗产价值的“店屋”，这是富裕人士及其家族办公室投资此类房产的日益增长的趋势的一部分。到 2023 年，该地区的家族办公室数量显著增长，仅新加坡就有 1400 多家。这些店屋因其独特的设计和保护状态而备受青睐——这种设计可以追溯到 1800 年代中国移民时期，可用于住宅或商业等各种用途。

## 有趣的问题：

**问：是哪些因素促使像雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）家族的办公室这样的亿万富翁们越来越有兴趣收购新加坡的遗产店屋？**
**答：**富裕人士及其家族办公室对这些房产投资日益增长的趋势可归因于几个因素。首先，这些房产兼具历史魅力和现代功能，既能满足文化意义又能用于居住或商业等实用目的，这吸引了投资者。其次，2022 年外国人财产印花税从 30% 上调至 60%，导致一些外国买家将目光投向了具有遗产价值的店屋，因为这些房产不受该政策的影响。B：此外，新加坡稳定的政治环境、强劲的经济和健全的法律框架使其成为国际投资者寻求多元化投资组合的理想目的地。这个城市国家还提供高品质的生活、优良的基础设施以及进入区域市场的通道，进一步增强了其作为房地产投资首选目的地的吸引力。C: 最后，新加坡最近对洗钱活动的调查导致了对家族办公室及其收购行为的审查越来越严格。这可能促使一些富人寻求替代性投资方式，例如不太可能与非法活动有关或引起监管机构不必要关注的遗产店屋等。D：总而言之，独特房产特征、有利的市场条件以及希望在对家族办公室加强审查之际进行多元化投资等因素的结合，促使雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）家族的办公室等亿万富翁们越来越有兴趣收购新加坡的遗产店屋
