# 英国的新粮食安全指数只是政策乏力的借口 

英国历来对农业持矛盾态度，**偏向低廉的食物价格以抑制工资上涨**，导致该国缺少连贯的粮食政策。由里希·苏纳克（Rishi Sunak）首相领导的现任政府似乎也在延续这一趋势。尽管召开了“从农场到餐桌峰会”并宣布了新政策，但这些举措未能解决脱欧后劳工短缺、农民成本上升以及确保低收入家庭获得负担得起的健康饮食等关键问题。 

苏纳克提出的**粮食安全指数** 有九项指标，被作者批评为忽视了对粮食安全的国际公认定义：包括可获取性、可利用性 、可用性、稳定性、可持续性和消费者机构。应用这些指标得到的英国粮食安全图景要比政府的指数显示的状况严峻得多。任何对英国 **粮食安全** 的全面评估都应考虑到脱欧造成的边境延误、高食物价格、浪费、污染和焦虑的消费者等因素。

作者认为，以往政府也未能对粮食安全战略采取整体性方法，常常忽视独立审查者的建议。如果政策制定者不解决这一问题，那么继续否认英国粮食体系面临的威胁可能会产生严重后果。需要更加细致入微地理解并积极主动地应对政策，以确保该国长期 **粮食韧性**。

# Britain's new food security index is a poor excuse for policy 

**Britain's historical ambivalence towards agriculture**, favoring cheap food to keep wages down, has resulted in a **lack of coherent food policy**. The current government, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, seems to be following this trend. While convening the "Farm to Fork Summit" and announcing new policies, these initiatives fall short of addressing key issues such as labor shortages post-Brexit, rising costs for farmers, and ensuring affordable access to healthy food for low-income families. 

Sunak's announcement of a **Food Security Index** with nine indicators is criticized by the writer as ignoring internationally recognized definitions of food security. These include availability, access, utilization, stability, sustainability, and consumer agency. Applying these indicators reveals a less positive picture than the government's index suggests. Border delays due to Brexit, high food prices, waste, pollution, and anxious consumers are all factors that should be considered in any comprehensive assessment of Britain's **food security**. 

The writer argues that previous administrations have also failed to take a holistic approach to food security strategy, often ignoring independent reviewers' recommendations. This denial of the threats facing Britain's food system may have dire consequences if left unaddressed by policymakers. A more nuanced understanding and proactive policy responses are needed to ensure the country's long-term **food resilience**.
