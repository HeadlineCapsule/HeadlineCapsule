# Uber to buy Delivery Hero's foodpanda Taiwan business in $1.25bn deal

Uber has entered into an agreement to acquire **Delivery Hero's foodpanda business** in Taiwan for a substantial sum of $1.25 billion. This strategic move includes a $950 million cash purchase of foodpanda's Taiwan operations and a $300 million investment for a 3% stake in Delivery Hero, demonstrating Uber's commitment to expanding its presence in the competitive food delivery market. 

The acquisition of foodpanda Taiwan is expected to enhance Uber's **food and grocery delivery services** in the region, allowing them to reach smaller cities and southern regions of Taiwan that foodpanda already has a presence in. This deal follows a similar partnership between Uber and Instacart in the US, highlighting Uber's focus on expanding its delivery offerings and reaching new customers. 

The transaction has been well-received by investors, with Delivery Hero's shares soaring by almost 20% on Tuesday. This influx of capital will enable Delivery Hero to **enhance its capital structure** by repurchasing convertible bonds. Meanwhile, Uber, having achieved full-year operating profitability in 2023, continues to prioritize financial discipline while seeking strategic opportunities for growth. 

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in 2025, marking a significant step forward in Uber's expansion plans in the Asia-Pacific region, where it aims to increase its presence and market share.
