墨西哥比索因选举后果而承压，左翼政党巩固其权力

**新闻摘要：** 由于左翼政党在选举中获胜，墨西哥比索大幅下跌。由总统安德烈斯·曼努埃尔·洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔领导的莫雷纳联盟取得了重大胜利，克劳迪亚·谢因鲍姆成为第一位女总统，以超过30个百分点的优势获胜。这一结果引起了市场担忧，导致比索本周对美元贬值近8%。

莫雷纳联盟现在拥有近三分之二的多数席位，可以实施宪法变化，例如废除独立监管机构，直接选举最高法院法官和选举当局成员。此前，市场因缺乏国会支持而驳回了这些改革；然而，最近的选举结果表明莫雷纳可能现在有足够的支持来通过它们。

洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔总统通过翻倍最低工资和增加社会项目，维持着60年代中期的批准评级。他的拟议改革包括禁止转基因玉米、高于通货膨胀的最低工资增长以及对公共财政造成压力的养老金承诺。

谢因鲍姆面临着各种挑战，例如在洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔放弃紧缩承诺后，在其第一年减少接近GDP配额的赤字。一些拟议的变更可能违反墨西哥与美国和加拿大的贸易协议，这对于外国投资至关重要。莫雷纳领导人对改革状态发表了相互矛盾的声明，导致市场进一步不确定性。

由于中央银行设定的高利率、强劲的汇款、出口收入以及近岸趋势的潜在收益，比索一直是最表现出色的新兴市场货币之一。然而，国内政治现在主导了市场焦点，因为人们担心墨西哥法治恶化可能导致企业暂停投资项目。

 **Article Summary:** Mexico's peso experienced significant decline due to election fallout as the left-wing party secured power. The ruling Morena coalition, led by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, achieved a substantial victory with Claudia Sheinbaum becoming the first female president and securing over 30 points margin. This outcome has resulted in market concerns, leading to an almost 8% drop of peso against the dollar this week.

The Morena coalition now holds near two-thirds majority, enabling them to implement constitutional changes such as eliminating independent regulators and directly electing supreme court justices and electoral authority board members. Previously, markets had dismissed these reforms due to lack of congressional support; however, the recent election results indicate that Morena may now have enough backing to pass them.

President López Obrador has maintained approval ratings in mid-60s by doubling minimum wage and increasing social programs. His proposed reforms include a ban on genet ically modified corn, above-inflation rises in the minimum wage, and pension promises that strain public finances.

Sheinbaum faces challenges such as reducing a deficit of almost cuota de GDP in her first year after López Obrador abandoned austerity commitments. Some proposed changes may violate Mexico's trade agreement with the US and Canada, which is crucial for foreign investment. Morena leaders have expressed contrasting statements on reform status, causing further market uncertainty.

The peso had been one of the top-performing emerging market currencies due to high interest rates set by the central bank, strong remittances, export income, and potential benefits from nearshoring trends. However, domestic politics now dominate market focus as fears over deteriorating rule of law in Mexico may lead businesses to pause investment projects.
