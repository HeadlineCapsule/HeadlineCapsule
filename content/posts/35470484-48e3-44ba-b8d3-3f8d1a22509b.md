# 英盟制药公司受累于业绩延迟公布与CEO离任

**英盟制药公司**（Alliance Pharmaceuticals）面临业绩延迟公布与高层变动的挑战。

**总部位于英国**的英盟制药公司已**第三次**延迟发布其**2023财年**业绩，导致公司股价下跌**20%**。该公司在**超过100个国家**销售**非处方药和处方药**，并声称延迟发布业绩的原因是审计工作延误。此外，该公司宣布，其任职多年的**首席执行官彼得·巴特菲尔德**（Peter Butterfield）离任，但这与业绩延迟公布无关。连续多次的延迟公布业绩引发了分析师和投资者的质疑，Liberum 分析师**塞巴斯蒂安·简泰**（Seb Jantet）对该公司周围的负面猜测发表了评论。

财务报告延迟和高层变动是英盟制药公司近期面临的一系列挑战的最新动态。该公司还面临其他问题，包括**英国竞争和市场管理局（CMA）的罚款**和**2023年暂停股息分派**。 CMA 在罚款后寻求取消巴特菲尔德的董事资格，但任命**尼克·塞奇威克**（Nick Sedgwick）为继任者避免了进一步的不确定性。塞奇威克与最近任命的董事会主席**卡米洛·帕内**（Camillo Pane）有过合作关系。

在**一连串的收购**和**债务增加**的情况下，新一届领导层面临着扭转公司表现的艰巨任务。在**1月发布的贸易更新**中，英盟下调了**2024年**的**盈利预期**，表明需要扩大在销售和营销方面的投资。自**2003年**上市以来，该公司一直专注于收购老牌药品品牌，累计花费**3.8亿英镑**。然而，这些收购中很少有成功的，该公司过于依赖一款名为**凯洛可**（Kelo-Cote）的疤痕治疗产品来获得收入，这引起了人们的担忧。过去一年的股价下跌影响了英国投资者，分析师质疑英国投资界是否会继续支持该公司。

# Alliance Pharma hit by delayed results and chief’s exit

Alliance Pharmaceuticals is facing challenges with delayed financial results and leadership changes. 

**UK-based** Alliance Pharmaceuticals has delayed the publication of its **2023 financial results** for the **third time**, citing auditing delays. This has sent the company's shares down by 20%. The company, which sells **over-the-counter and prescription drugs** in over **100 countries**, announced that its auditor, Deloitte, needed more time to check its accounts. In addition, the company revealed the departure of its long-serving **CEO, Peter Butterfield**, although this is reported to be unrelated to the delay in results. The repeated delays have raised questions among analysts and investors, with Liberum analyst **Seb Jantet** commenting on the negative speculation surrounding the company. 

The delays in financial reporting and leadership changes are the latest in a series of challenges for Alliance Pharmaceuticals. The company has faced additional issues, including a **fine from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)** and the **suspension of its dividend** in **2023**. The CMA had sought to disqualify Butterfield as a director following the fine, but the appointment of **Nick Sedgwick** as his replacement has avoided further uncertainty. Sedgwick joins recently appointed board chair **Camillo Pane**, with whom he has a previous working relationship. 

With a string of **acquisitions** and **increasing debt**, the new leadership has a challenging task ahead to turn around the company's performance. In a **January trading update**, Alliance cut its **profit expectations** for **2024**, indicating the need for expanded investments in sales and marketing. The company's strategy has focused on acquiring old medicine brands, with a spend of **£380mn** on acquisitions since its listing in **2003**. However, few of these acquisitions have proved successful, and the company's heavy reliance on a single scar treatment product, **Kelo-Cote**, for revenue raises concerns. The share price decline over the past year has impacted the company's UK investors, and analysts question the continued support for the company within the UK investment community.
