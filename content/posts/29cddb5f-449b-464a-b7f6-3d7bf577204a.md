# 顶级英美股东支持分手计划，BHP 的时间紧迫 

**Legal & General Investment Management(LGIM)**是**英美公司**最大的股东之一，该公司对英美公司拟议的拆分战略表示支持。这是在采矿巨头 BHP 对英美公司提出并购意向后提出的。距离英国收购规则规定的最后期限仅剩几天时间，英美公司坚决拒绝了BHP 的竞标。 英美致力于说服股东们相信其可以作为独立的实体创造更多价值，方法是剥离某些资产，专注于受青睐的铁矿石和铜业务。 该战略得到了持有近 2% 英美股份的 LGIM 的支持，尽管该行承认执行方面存在挑战。 BHP 的第二次全股票提案对英美的估值为340亿英镑（460亿美元），但英美认为这一提议“极其不吸引人”，因为它要求主要部门分拆并低估了其价值。 一些投资者对英美公司顺利实施分手计划的能力持怀疑态度，而另一些投资者则认为 BHP 更有能力通过收购来释放价值。随着最后期限临近，两家公司都未就任何可能的最后一分钟谈判或战略转变发表评论。

# Top Anglo shareholder backs breakup plan as clock ticks for BHP 

**Legal & General Investment Management**, one of **Anglo American's** largest shareholders, has voiced support for the company's proposed break-up strategy amid ongoing takeover interest from mining giant **BHP**. With just days remaining until a deadline imposed by UK takeover rules, Anglo American is standing firm in its rejection of BHP's bids. The former aims to convince shareholders that it can create more value as a standalone entity by hiving off certain assets and focusing on its coveted iron ore and copper businesses. This strategy has the backing of Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which holds almost 2% of Anglo American shares, despite acknowledging the challenges in execution. BHP's second all-stock proposal valued Anglo at £34bn ($46bn), but it has been deemed "highly unattractive" by **Anglo** due to the required demerger of key divisions and a perceived undervaluation. Some investors remain skeptical about Anglo's ability to execute its break-up plan smoothly, while others argue that BHP is better equipped to unlock value through a takeover. As the clock ticks towards the deadline, both companies maintain their silence on any potential last-minute negotiations or strategic shifts.
