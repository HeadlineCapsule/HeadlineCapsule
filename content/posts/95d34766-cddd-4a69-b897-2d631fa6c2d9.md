# 工党指责里希·苏纳克在 NHS 候诊时间上失信于患者 

**第一段** 

**工党**指责**英国首相里希·苏纳克**因**NHS 候诊时间**延长而失信于患者，这是选民关注的关键问题。工党分析发现，自 2019 年大选以来，英格兰三分之二的**NHS 信托机构**未能达到医院治疗 18 周的候诊时间目标，共有 114 家信托机构未达标。在即将到来的大选中，这个问题将成为工党攻击保守党的一个关键着力点。 

**第二段** 

候诊时间在保守党执政期间显著增加，根据**NHS 英格兰**的数据，候诊名单从 2010 年的 260 万患者增加到 2023 年 2 月的 750 万。在此期间，中位数候诊时间也从 5.5 周增加到 14.8 周。工党影子卫生大臣韦斯·斯特里汀批评了 NHS 的现状，强调“人们不再相信 NHS 会在他们需要时提供帮助”。 

**第三段** 

工党的分析还显示，大多数**NHS 信托机构**经常未能达到在 4 小时内接待急诊科 95% 患者的目标。在过去五年中，只有 10 家信托机构在排除疫情封锁时期后，每月达到了这一目标。政府尚未对工党提出的指责和分析作出立即回应。

# Labour accuses Rishi Sunak of failing patients on NHS waiting times 

**Paragraph 1** 

The Labour Party has accused **UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak** of failing patients due to prolonged **NHS waiting times**, a key issue for voters. Labour's analysis reveals that **two-thirds of NHS trusts** in England have missed the **18-week waiting time target** for hospital treatment since the 2019 general election, with 114 trusts falling short. This issue is set to become a **pivotal point of attack** by Labour against the Conservatives in the upcoming general election.

**Paragraph 2** 

**Waiting times** have significantly increased during the Conservatives' tenure, with NHS England data indicating that **waiting lists** have grown from 2.6 million patients in 2010 to 7.5 million in February 2023. The median waiting time has also doubled from 5.5 weeks to 14.8 weeks during this period. Labour's shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, criticized the current state of the NHS, highlighting that "people can no longer trust the NHS to be there for them when they need it."

**Paragraph 3** 

Labour's analysis also showed that **most NHS trusts** regularly miss the target of seeing **95% of patients** in accident and emergency departments within four hours. Only 10 trusts have achieved this monthly target in the past five years, excluding pandemic lockdowns. The government has not provided an immediate response to Labour's accusations and analysis.
