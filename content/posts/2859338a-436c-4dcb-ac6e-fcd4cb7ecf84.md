特朗普启动硅谷拉票攻势 举办爆满筹款活动

**前共和党总统唐纳德·特朗普在硅谷投资者大卫·萨克斯（David Sacks）举办的筹款活动中筹集了1200万美元。这次活动在他位于旧金山“亿万富翁大道”的庄园举行，这标志着尽管活动举办地位于民主党的据点，但科技界仍给予了显著支持。**

**与会者包括瑞安·塞尔キス（Messari首席执行官）、雅各布·赫尔伯格（Palantir高级管理人员）以及Coinbase和温克沃斯双胞胎的代表，这表明特朗普在硅谷科技领袖中的支持不断增长。**

**在纽约被判犯有34项重罪后，特朗普举办了这次活动。尽管有这一判决，但他的支持者仍坚定不移，其中一些人向他的竞选活动捐赠了大量资金，其他人则公开支持他。**

**硅谷的科技领袖越来越担心乔·拜登总统任期内的言论自由、技术监管和税收等问题。加密领域尤其感到不满，因为他们认为这是一个敌对的监管政权。**

**特朗普将继续他的西海岸之旅，计划在洛杉矶和新港海滩举行活动，表明尽管最近遇到了法律麻烦，但科技界仍持续支持他。**

 **Summary of Article**

- Former Republican president Donald Trump raised $12 million during a fundraiser hosted by Silicon Valley investor David Sacks. The event took place at his mansion on "billionaire's row" in San Francisco, marking significant support from the tech community despite being held in a Democratic stronghold.

- Attendees included prominent figures such as Ryan Selkis (CEO of Messari), Jacob Helberg (senior Palantir executive), and representatives from Coinbase and Winklevoss twins, indicating growing support for Trump among Silicon Valley's tech leaders.

- The event comes after Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of felony in New York last week. Despite the verdict, his supporters remain steadfast, with some donating significant amounts to his campaign and others publicly endorsing him.

- Silicon Valley's tech leaders are increasingly concerned about issues such as free speech, technology regulation, and taxes under President Joe Biden's administration. The crypto sector, in particular, feels aggrieved by what it perceives to be a hostile regulatory regime.

- Trump continues his West Coast tour with events planned for Los Angeles and Newport Beach, indicating ongoing support from the tech community despite recent legal troubles.
