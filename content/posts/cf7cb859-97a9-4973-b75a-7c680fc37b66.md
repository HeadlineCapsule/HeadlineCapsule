G7因中国支持俄罗斯战争而威胁对中国实施更多制裁

翻译：
G7因为中国支援俄罗斯的战争行为，而威胁要对华采取更多的制裁措施。

**文章摘要：**

七国集团（G7）领导人对中国在乌克兰持续冲突中支持俄罗斯发出了严厉警告。G7指责北京通过向莫斯科的国防工业提供材料，为俄罗斯的战争努力提供了“便利”，并威胁如果这种行为继续下去将采取进一步制裁。

在意大利举行的峰会发表的联合声明标志着对中国的立场比以往更加强硬，反映了美国和欧洲对中国在乌克兰战争期间支持俄罗斯日益增长的不满。G7领导人敦促中国停止转移有助于俄罗斯国防部门的两用材料。

美国一直在推动其G7中的欧洲伙伴国，包括法国、德国、意大利和英国采取更加强硬的态度对待中国。所有G7成员国现在都认为中国的对俄支持对欧洲的安全构成了长期威胁。

世界领先的发达经济体表达了在经济上惩罚中国的意愿，包括通过制裁，这与对中国经济政策的担忧以及它与俄罗斯的关系有关，还有俄罗斯-伊朗在军事装备和战场知识方面的合作。

G7也在中国的经济政策上变得更加对抗性，例如欧盟宣布对被指控从不公平补贴中受益的中国电动汽车制造商征收新关税。然而，在如何经济回应方面，集团内部存在分歧，一些人主张当G7成员针对中国采取反制措施时应采取“不伤害”原则。

中国官方媒体批评了这次峰会，并将美国描绘成操纵其欧洲盟友对俄罗斯采取行动，并在各种问题上转向对抗中国。尽管如此，一些欧洲国家与中国保持着强大的商业关系，并谨慎避免升级贸易紧张局势。

 **Summary of Article:**

The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) have issued a stern warning to China regarding its support for Russia amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The G7 accused Beijing of "enabling" Russia's war efforts by providing materials used by Moscow’s defense industry, and threatened further sanctions if this behavior continues.

The joint statement from the summit held in Italy marked a tougher stance towards China than previously seen, reflecting growing frustration within the US and Europe over Beijing's support for Russia during the Ukraine war. The G7 leaders urged China to cease transferring dual-use materials that contribute to Russia’s defense sector.

The US has been advocating for its European partners in the G7, including France, Germany, Italy, and the UK, to adopt a more hawkish approach towards China. The support of China for Russia is now seen as posing a long-term threat to Europe's security by all members of the G7.

The world’s leading advanced economies have expressed their willingness to take new steps in punishing China financially, including through sanctions. This comes alongside concerns about China's economic policies and its ties with Russia, as well as Russian-Iranian cooperation on military equipment and battlefield knowledge.

The G7 is also becoming more confrontational over Beijing’s economic policies, such as the EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric car makers accused of benefiting from unfair subsidies. However, there are differing opinions within the group regarding how to respond economically, with some advocating for a "do no harm" approach among G7 members when taking countermeasures against China.

Chinese state media has criticized the summit and portrayed the US as manipulating its European allies into action against Russia and turning against China on various issues. Despite this, some European countries maintain strong commercial relations with China and are cautious about escalating trade tensions.
