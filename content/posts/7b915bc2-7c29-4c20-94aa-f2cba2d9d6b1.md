# 根据拟议中的协议，公众将对 Teesworks 污染承担责任 

**保守党市长****本·豪臣****（Ben Houchen）**担任一家公共机构的主席，该机构目前正在就曾属于一家钢铁厂、位于英格兰东北部的 **Teesworks 遗址**谈判一项交易。**南蒂赛发展公司 (STDC)** 在与商人 **克里斯· Musgrave 和马丁·科尼 (Martin Corney)** 的谈判中受到严格审查，后者拥有这片 2500 英亩土地开发机构 90% 的股份。 2021 年，STDC 将 ****Teesworks Limited**近乎全部的所有权无偿转让给 Musgrave 和 Corney，并允许他们以每英亩 1 英镑的价格购买公共用地。政府的一项近期审查对 STDC 正谈判中的另外四项交易提出了质疑，包括一项将使纳税人为 Teesworks Limited 购入的土地上的任何污染承担责任的交易。尽管 STDC 初步声明不会推进这些谈判，但它确认其中三项提案仍然有效并正在讨论中，其中包括关于赔偿责任问题的提案。其余两项则涉及新建一个码头运营设施以及让公共部门提前支付治理费用以获得政府补贴。这引发了人们对透明度和纳税人资金效益的担忧，一项审查建议重新商讨该项目的 **公私分摊比例** 。Teesworks 是豪臣振兴该地区经济愿景的核心，但由于 Musgrave 和 Corney 通过 Teeswork Limited 获得了多数股权（STDC 仅持有10% 的股份），该公司在财务和治理方面备受争议。开发商还从与 STDC的其他有利可图的交易中获益，例如营销费和废金属销售收入。尽管豪臣为这些安排辩护，但审查发现目前没有证据表明开发人员对该场地进行了投资。 Teesworks Limited 在成为私有财产的第一年里将利润翻了两番，而公共资金已达 5.6 亿英镑。这种情况已经引发了针对英格兰分权地区治理的调查，并提出了有关此类项目透明度和纳税人价值的问题。

# Public to be liable for Teesworks contamination under proposed deal 

**Lord Ben Houchen**, a **Conservative mayor**, chairs a public body that is currently negotiating a deal regarding the **Teesworks site,** a former steel plant in northeast England. The **South Tees Development Corporation (STDC)** has come under scrutiny as it negotiates with businessmen **Chris Musgrave and Martin Corney**, who own 90% of the development vehicle for the 2500-acre site. In 2021, STDC transferred nearly full ownership of **Teesworks Limited** to Musgrave and Corney without monetary consideration and allowed them to purchase public land at £1 an acre. A recent government review questioned four additional deals being negotiated by STDC, including one that would make taxpayers liable for any contamination on plots bought by Teesworks Limited. Despite initially stating these negotiations were not being pursued, STDC confirmed that three of the proposals are still active and under discussion, including the liability deal. The other two involve creating a new quay operation facility and having the public sector pay upfront for remediation work to access government subsidies. This has raised concerns about transparency and value for taxpayers' money, with a review recommending renegotiation of the entire **public-private split** of the project. Teesworks is central to Houchen's vision for revitalizing the economy in the region but has faced controversy due to questions over finances and governance since Musgrave and Corney obtained majority ownership through Teeswork Limited; STDC retains only a 10% stake. The developers have also benefited from other lucrative deals with STDC, such as marketing fees and scrap metal sale proceeds. Despite Houchen's justification for these arrangements, the review found no evidence of developer investment in the site to date. With £560 million in public funding already received, Teesworks Limited tripled its profits in its first year under private ownership. This situation has prompted an inquiry into governance across England's devolved regions and raised questions about the transparency and value of such projects for taxpayers.
