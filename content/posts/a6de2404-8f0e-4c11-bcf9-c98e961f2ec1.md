# 迈克·约翰逊（Mike Johnson）成功留任美国众议院议长职位

**众议院议长**迈克·约翰逊（Mike Johnson）在**共和党激进派女议员玛乔丽·泰勒·格林（Marjorie Taylor Greene）**试图罢免他后，成功保住了议长职位。众议院否决了格林的动议，**民主党**人和大多数**共和党**人团结一致支持约翰逊。约翰逊于去年10月成为众议院的领袖。这一结果对格林来说是一个重大打击，她一直积极推动罢免约翰逊，主要是因为他决定允许就向**乌克兰提供610亿美元安全援助**进行表决，此举遭到特朗普派共和党人的反对。

格林的企图遭到了前总统**唐纳德·特朗普**的反对，他敦促共和党人拒绝格林的努力，强调党内团结的重要性。尽管格林试图效仿之前成功罢免**凯文·麦卡锡**（Kevin McCarthy）的做法，但她未能获得显著支持，只有11名共和党众议员站在她一边。约翰逊的留任确保了共和党在11月选举前的稳定，使共和党人能够专注于维持他们的多数派地位。

约翰逊表示：“我希望这标志着个性政治和无聊的人身攻击的结束。”这次投票凸显了特朗普派共和党人和传统党派成员之间的紧张关系，约翰逊在推动乌克兰援助投票中的作用对他获得双方的支持起到了关键作用。

# Mike Johnson Survives Attempt to Oust Him as US House Speaker

Mike Johnson, the **Speaker of the House of Representatives**, successfully retained his position following an attempt by **Marjorie Taylor Greene**, a hardline Republican congresswoman, to unseat him. The House voted against Greene's motion, with **Democrats** and most **Republicans** uniting to support Johnson, who became the top lawmaker in the lower chamber last October. This outcome is a significant blow to Greene, who had campaigned vigorously for Johnson's removal, primarily due to his decision to allow a vote on providing **$61bn in security aid to Ukraine**, a move opposed by pro-Trump Republicans. 

Greene's bid faced opposition from former president **Donald Trump**, who urged Republicans to reject her effort, emphasizing the need for party unity. Despite her attempts to replicate the previous successful ousting of **Kevin McCarthy**, Greene failed to garner significant support, with only 11 House Republicans siding with her. Johnson's survival ensures stability within the party ahead of the November election, allowing Republicans to focus on maintaining their majority.

"I hope this marks the end of personality politics and frivolous character assassination," Johnson stated, expressing his desire to move beyond infighting. The vote highlights the tension between pro-Trump Republicans and traditional party members, with Johnson's role in facilitating the Ukraine vote playing a pivotal role in his retention of support from both factions.
