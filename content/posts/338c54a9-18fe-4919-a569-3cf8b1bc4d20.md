# **布里克巷贝果店**的关闭在伦敦东区的留下了空隙

**丹尼尔·科恩**，**Beigel Bake** 的经理，谈到了其长期竞争对手**Beigel Shop**（位于伦敦东区**布里克巷**）的近期关闭。这两家面包店分别被称为“**白店**”和“**黄店**”，几十年来一直良性竞争，吸引了众多顾客，成为该地区备受喜爱的地标。如今，**Beigel Shop** 的关闭留下了空白，改变了著名的面包店竞争的态势。

布里克巷**贝果**的历史与 19 世纪定居于此的犹太社区有着千丝万缕的联系，他们逃离了东欧的迫害。贝果在布里克巷的出现反映了东区的文化演变，二战结束后，该地区迎来了孟加拉穆斯林群体，使该地区成为咖喱屋的聚集地。

**Beigel Shop** 的关闭象征着东区不断变化的面貌，不断上涨的租金和绅士化迫使许多老店铺纷纷撤出。这家面包店的消失影响了社区，包括当地供应商，例如保罗·加德纳（Paul Gardner）及其家人，他们世代为布里克巷的贝果店提供纸袋。

尽管科恩承认自竞争对手关闭以来，Beigel Bake 的生意有所增加，但他还是希望“黄店”能重开，因为两家店共同吸引了众多顾客。**Beigel Shop** 的缺席也突出了该地区小企业面临的挑战，包括疫情、食品通胀和社会问题的影响。

尽管面临这些困难，**Beigel Bake** 仍然是一家家族企业，科恩与他的兄弟和叔叔一起经营，并希望将来能把面包店传给自己的孩子。这家面包店也接受了现代影响，利用美食热潮和网红效应吸引了当地社区以外的顾客。

# Closure of Beigel Shop leaves a hole in London’s East End 

**Daniel Cohen**, manager of **Beigel Bake**, reflects on the recent closure of its long-time rival, the **Beigel Shop**, on **Brick Lane** in London's East End. The two bakeries, known as the "white one" and the "yellow one," respectively, had a friendly competition for decades, attracting queues of customers and becoming a beloved landmark in the area. The closure of the Beigel Shop has left a gap in the community and changed the dynamic of the famous bakery rivalry. 

/n/n

The history of **beigels** in Brick Lane is intertwined with the Jewish community that settled in the area in the **19th century**, fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe. The beigel's journey to Brick Lane reflects the cultural evolution of the East End, which later welcomed Bengali Muslims after World War II, transforming the area into a hub for curry houses. 

/n/n

The closure of the Beigel Shop is emblematic of the changing landscape of the East End, with rising rents and gentrification pushing out longstanding businesses. The loss of the bakery has impacted the community, including local suppliers like Paul Gardner, whose family has provided paper bags to the Brick Lane beigel shops for generations. 

/n/n

While Cohen acknowledges an increase in business for Beigel Bake since the closure of its rival, he expresses a desire for the "yellow one" to return, recognizing the collective appeal they offered to customers. The Beigel Shop's absence has also brought to light the challenges faced by small businesses in the area, including the impact of the pandemic, food inflation, and social issues. 

/n/n

Despite these challenges, Beigel Bake remains a family-run business, with Cohen working alongside his brother and uncle, and hoping to pass the bakery on to his children. The bakery has also embraced modern influences, benefiting from foodie virality and influencers, attracting customers beyond the local community.
