# 比亚迪和哪吒汽车瞄准印尼市场，加大电动汽车投资

**中国电动汽车制造商比亚迪和哪吒汽车** 正在采取行动进入和拓展**目前由日本汽车制造商主导**的印度尼西亚市场。

**比亚迪计划在爪哇岛投资 10 亿美元建造一家工厂**，将于 8 月开工建设，2026 年 1 月开始运营。这一重大投资表明了比亚迪对印度尼西亚市场的承诺，以及对该国汽车工业和清洁能源转型充满信心。

与此同时，**哪吒汽车也宣布计划在印度尼西亚开始当地生产**，已与 Handal Indonesia Motor 签署协议，合作开展电动汽车组装业务，计划于 2024 年第二季度开始运营。

两家公司在**Periklindo 电动汽车展**上首次亮相，比亚迪展示了定价约为 4.25 亿卢比的 Dolphin 车型，哪吒推出了定价在 2 亿到 3 亿卢比之间的 Neta V-II 车型，使其成为其在印度尼西亚产品线中价格最亲民的车型。

印度尼西亚是东南亚最大的汽车市场，去年售出了约 100 万辆新车。然而，**日本品牌控制了 90% 以上的市场份额**。中国电动汽车制造商正挑战这一主导地位，被印尼丰富的电池原料，如镍，和政府支持的政策所吸引。

在佐科·维多多总统的领导下，印度尼西亚政府成功利用了本国丰富的镍资源吸引电池和电动汽车生产商的投资，促进了本土电动汽车产业的发展。预计在即将上任的总统普拉博沃·苏比安托的领导下，这一战略将继续实施。

其他外国汽车制造商，如**韩国现代汽车**和中国**五菱汽车**，最近也开始在印度尼西亚开展生产或组装业务，进一步加剧了市场竞争。

尽管美国和欧洲市场的电动汽车需求放缓，但比亚迪仍对印度尼西亚市场持乐观态度，并指出年轻消费者和家庭的需求不断增长，且政府激励政策也十分给力。

印度尼西亚的电池电动汽车销量在 2023 年猛增了近 70%，展示了该国电动汽车普及的潜力。

# China’s BYD and Neta Target Indonesia Market with EV Investments 

**Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers BYD and Neta Auto** are making moves to enter and expand in the Indonesian market, which is currently **dominated by Japanese automakers**. 

**BYD plans to build a $1 billion factory in West Java**, with construction starting in August and operations commencing in January 2026. This significant investment demonstrates BYD's commitment to the Indonesian market and its confidence in the country's automotive industry and clean energy transition. 

Meanwhile, **Neta Auto has also announced plans to initiate local production in Indonesia**, signing an agreement with Handal Indonesia Motor for EV assembly, with operations scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2024. 

The two companies made their debut at the **Periklindo Electric Vehicle Show**, with BYD unveiling the Dolphin, priced at about 425 million rupiah, and Neta introducing the Neta V-II, priced between 200 million and 300 million rupiah, making it the most affordable model in their Indonesia line-up. 

Indonesia is Southeast Asia's largest auto market, with about 1 million new cars sold last year. However, **Japanese brands control more than 90% of the market**. Chinese EV makers are now challenging this dominance, attracted by Indonesia's abundant battery materials, such as nickel, and supportive government policies. 

The Indonesian government, under President Joko Widodo, has successfully leveraged the country's nickel resources to attract investments from battery and EV producers, fostering the growth of a homegrown EV industry. This strategy is expected to continue under incoming president Prabowo Subianto. 

Other foreign automakers, such as **South Korea's Hyundai and China's Wuling Motors**, have also recently started production or assembly operations in Indonesia, further intensifying the competition in the market. 

Despite slowing EV demand in markets like the US and Europe, BYD remains optimistic about Indonesia, citing growing demand from young consumers and families, as well as government incentive programs. 

Indonesia's sales of battery electric cars jumped nearly 70% in 2023, showcasing the potential for EV adoption in the country.
