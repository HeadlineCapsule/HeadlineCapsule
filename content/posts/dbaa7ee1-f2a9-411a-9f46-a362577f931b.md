法国计划向乌克兰派遣幻影战斗机。

**法国将向乌克兰派遣幻影战斗机**

法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙宣布计划向乌克兰派遣一些幻影战斗机，作为对抗俄罗斯军队在乌克兰领土上推进的增加援助工作的一部分。目标是在今年年底之前让飞行员和战斗机到达乌克兰，法国正在寻求一个拥有幻影 2000 型号的国家联盟来开展这项行动。

北约盟国比利时、挪威、丹麦和荷兰也致力于援助工作，承诺向乌克兰派遣大约 90 架美国制造的 F-16 战斗机。法国领导人表示，法国将训练和装备一支由大约四千五百名男子组成的乌克兰部队。

幻影是一款多用途战斗机，于 20 世纪 70 年代开始服役，最现代化的版本是具有先进雷达能力的 2000-5 型号。然而，它在法国武装部队中已经被更先进的阵风战斗机所取代。

乌克兰总统沃洛德米尔·泽连斯基继续向西方盟友施压，要求增加军事援助并解除武器使用的限制，包括允许基辅针对俄罗斯领土。马克龙此前建议，应该允许乌克兰使用西方制造的武器打击俄罗斯的军事基地。

泽连斯基目前正在法国出席纪念诺曼底登陆 80 周年的活动，并与法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙和美国总统乔·拜登会面，后者已经允许乌克兰有限制地使用西方制造的武器对抗俄罗斯军队。

尽管泽连斯基在会上寻求更多的军事援助，但他提出的一项请求——西方盟友向乌克兰派遣军事教官——尚未得到批准。马克龙暗示了这种可能性的存在，但并没有承诺为了培训目的而派遣人员。他提到与其他国家进行对话，以形成一个愿意提供教官的联盟，强调这将在乌克兰主权领土上发生，不会被视为对俄罗斯的升级行动。

莫斯科宣布逮捕一名涉嫌间谍活动的法国公民，这是法国和俄罗斯之间紧张关系的另一个迹象。马克龙证实了这一逮捕，但澄清说，该个人受雇于一家非政府组织，与法国没有任何关系。

 **France to Send Mirage Fighter Jets to Ukraine**

French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to dispatch some Mirage fighter jets to Ukraine as part of increased aid efforts against Russian advances on Ukrainian territory. The goal is to have the pilots and jets in Ukraine by year's end, with France seeking a coalition of countries that own the Mirage 2000 model for this initiative.

Nato allies such as Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also contributing to aid efforts by committing to dispatching about ninety US-made F-16 fighters to Ukraine. The French leader stated that France would train and equip an entire brigade of Ukrainian troops, consisting of approximately four thousand five hundred men.

The Mirage is a multirole fighter jet first entering service in the 1970s, with the most modern version being the 2000-5 model featuring advanced radar capabilities. However, it has been largely replaced by the more advanced Rafale within French armed forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues to press western allies for increased military aid and lifting restrictions on weapon use, including allowing Kyiv to target Russian territory. Macron previously suggested that Ukraine should be allowed to hit Russian military sites with Western-made weapons.

Zelenskyy is currently in France attending events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day landings and meeting with both French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden, who has given limited permission for Ukraine to use western-made weapons against Russian military sites.

While Zelenskyy seeks more military aid in his meetings, one request—for Western allies to send military instructors to Ukraine—has not yet been granted. Macron hinted at the possibility of such a move but has stopped short of committing to dispatching people for training purposes. He mentioned ongoing talks with other countries to form a coalition willing to provide instructors, emphasizing that this would occur on Ukrainian sovereign territory and not be seen as an escalatory factor against Russia.

In another sign of tensions between France and Russia, Moscow announced the arrest of a French citizen suspected of espionage. Macron confirmed the arrest but clarified that the individual was employed by a non-governmental organization without any role working for France.
