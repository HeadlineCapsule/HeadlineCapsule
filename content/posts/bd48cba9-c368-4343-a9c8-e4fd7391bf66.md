# Uber 的外卖收购应该带来更多的整合

**Uber 以 9.5 亿美元收购了 Delivery Hero 的台湾子公司 Uber Eats**，同时向 Delivery Hero 投资 3 亿美元股权，这突显了外卖应用领域可能出现整合。该笔交易使 Delivery Hero 的市值增加了 17.5 亿美元，部分原因是 Uber 支付的价格很有吸引力——为 GMV 的 0.6 倍，而 Delivery Hero 的交易倍数为 0.3 倍。该笔交易还帮助 Delivery Hero 减少了净债务，使其达到更易管理的水平。

此次交易凸显了 Delivery Hero 在韩国、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国等关键市场的存在价值，同时也引发了人们对台湾外卖市场可能出现**垄断控制**的担忧。该行业理性在增加，预计多家公司今年将实现正现金流，这让投资者感到鼓舞。进一步的整合，尤其是在竞争激烈的**东南亚和拉丁美洲市场**，可能会改善所有参与者的市场条件。跨境并购还可以创建更强大的区域品牌，在更大的规模上传播技术、广告和固定成本。该交易表明，更周全的扩张策略和对核心市场的关注可以带来回报，而且对资产的合理调整可以为投资者呈现一个更具吸引力的投资建议。

# Uber's food delivery buy should serve up more consolidation

**Uber's recent acquisition of Delivery Hero's Taiwanese unit, Uber Eats,** for $950 million, coupled with a $300 million equity investment in Delivery Hero, has highlighted the potential for consolidation in the food delivery app sector. The deal added $1.75 billion to Delivery Hero's market capitalization, partly due to the attractive price Uber paid – 0.6 times GMV compared to Delivery Hero's trading multiple of 0.3 times. The sale also helps reduce Delivery Hero's net debt, bringing it to more manageable levels. 

This transaction has brought to light the value of Delivery Hero's presence in key markets such as South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, while also raising questions about the potential for **monopolistic control** in the Taiwanese food delivery sector. Investors are encouraged by the increasing rationality in the sector, with several companies expected to turn cash flow positive this year. Further consolidation, especially in **competitive markets** in Southeast Asia and Latin America, could improve market conditions for all players. Cross-border M&A could also create stronger regional brands, spreading technology, advertising, and fixed costs over a larger scale. The deal suggests that a more thoughtful approach to expansion and a focus on core markets can pay dividends, and that a tidying-up of assets can reveal a much more appealing proposition for investors.
