迈雷的无政府资本主义梦想与阿根廷现实相冲突。

## 总结：
阿根廷总统 **哈维尔·米莱** 的执政风格融合了无政府资本主义言论和务实的经济政策。尽管他最初承诺实施激进的变革，例如采用美元、减少国家干预以及切断与中国和巴西的联系，但米莱伊的行动却较为温和，这是全球经济现实与阿根廷根深蒂固的政治和经济挑战所导致的。

米莱伊接手了一个饱受 **高通胀** 、财政管理不善、保护主义和裙带关系困扰的经济体。他的政府采取了正确的措施，包括贬值比索、实施财政紧缩政策以及清理中央银行的资产负债表。阿根廷实现了16 年来的首次季度基本财政盈余；然而，这在一定程度上是由于高通胀等一次性因素降低了实际支出。

尽管面临国会和各省省长反对，米莱伊仍在经济议程上取得了一些进展。在国际上，他保持务实的态度，避免与中国和巴西等主要贸易伙伴发生冲突，同时奉行主流政策，如批准南方共同市场-欧盟贸易协定。

## 趣味问题：

1. Q: 米莱伊的无政府资本主义言论与他实际的经济政策之间有何差异？
   A: 哈维尔·米莱在竞选时提出了一个激进变革的平台，包括采用美元和减少国家干预。然而，他的总统任期却以较为温和的行动为标志。这是由于全球经济现实以及阿根廷根深蒂固的政治和经济挑战限制了他实施无政府资本主义政策的空间。

2. Q: 阿根廷实现 16 年来首次季度基本财政盈余有哪些因素？
   A：这在一定程度上要归功于高通胀等一次性因素降低了实际支出，这种效应在阿根廷被称为“搅拌机”效应。此外，米莱伊政府实施的财政紧缩方案和中央银行资产负债表清理也为这一成就做出了贡献。

3. Q: 哈维尔·米莱在总统任期内是如何处理国际贸易关系的？
   A：尽管发表了无政府资本主义的言论，但米莱伊在处理国际贸易关系时采取了务实的方法。他避免与中国和巴西等主要贸易伙伴发生冲突，同时奉行主流政策，例如批准南方共同市场-欧盟贸易协定。这表明他的政府认识到在全球经济现实和阿根廷对出口的依赖（尤其是商品）的情况下，其行动空间有限。

## Summary:
In this article, **Javier Milei**'s presidency in Argentina has been characterized by a mix of anarcho-capitalist rhetoric and pragmatic economic policies. Despite his initial promises to implement radical changes such as adopting the US dollar, reducing state intervention, and severing ties with China and Brazil, Milei's actions have been more moderate due to global economic realities and Argentina's deep-seated political and economic challenges.

Milei inherited an economy plagued by **soaring inflation**, fiscal mismanagement, and a history of protectionism and cronyism. His administration has taken steps in the right direction with measures like devaluing the peso, implementing fiscal tightening, and cleaning up the central bank's balance sheet. Argentina achieved its first quarterly primary fiscal surplus in 16 years; however, this was partly due to one-off factors such as high inflation reducing real spending.

Despite facing opposition from Congress and provincial governors, Milei has managed to make some progress on his economic agenda. Internationally, he has maintained a pragmatic approach by avoiding conflicts with major trade partners like China and Brazil while pursuing mainstream policies such as ratifying the Mercosur-EU trade agreement.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How does Milei's anarcho-capitalist rhetoric contrast with his actual economic policies? 
   A: While Javier Milei campaigned on a platform of radical change, including adopting the US dollar and reducing state intervention, his presidency has been marked by more moderate actions. This is due to global economic realities and Argentina's deep-seated political and economic challenges that limit the extent to which he can implement anarcho-capitalist policies.
2. Q: What factors contributed to Argentina achieving its first quarterly primary fiscal surplus in 16 years?
   A: The fiscal surplus was partly due to one-off factors such as high inflation reducing real spending, known as the "blender" effect in Argentina. Additionally, Milei'cu administration implemented a fiscal tightening package and cleaned up the central bank's balance sheet, contributing to this achievement.
3. Q: How has Javier Milei approached international trade relations during his presidency?
   A: Despite his anarcho-capitalist rhetoric, Milei has taken a pragmatic approach in handling international trade relations. He avoided conflicts with major trade partners like China and Brazil while pursuing mainstream policies such as ratifying the Mercosur-EU trade agreement. This demonstrates that his administration recognizes limited room for maneuvering due to global economic realities and Argentina's dependence on exports, particularly in commodities.
