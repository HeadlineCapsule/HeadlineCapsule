特斯拉股东批准埃隆·马斯克创纪录的薪酬协议并搬迁到得克萨斯州

尽管特斯拉在过去一年的表现令人失望，股价下跌 29%，市值为 5710 亿美元，但特斯拉在周四上涨了 3%，这是由于马斯克的帖子。主席罗宾·登霍姆 (Robyn Denholm) 在此结果中发挥了关键作用，强调马斯克达到了 2018 年原始一揽子方案中规定的股价和财务目标。

马斯克还经营着太空探索技术公司、神经链接公司和 xAI 公司，他公开威胁说，如果他的股份比例没有增加，他将会在特斯拉之外开发未来的 AI 产品。他认为，至少需要 25% 的股份来保护公司免受活动家或敌意收购的影响。

关于马斯克薪酬方案的最终投票数据可能于周五发布，先驱者和黑石公司已经支持了两项决议。这个故事的下一步是下个月在特拉华州举行的听证会，以考虑获胜律师提出的 52 亿美元的费用请求。

尽管特斯拉计划在德克萨斯州重新注册，但这不太可能影响薪酬决定，因为当地法院仍必须尊重特拉华州的裁决。这段文字以庆祝情绪结束，在奥斯汀举行的一次活动中，马斯克回答了股东的问题并受到了在线赞扬。

 The passage discusses Tesla's recent stock performance and the reapproval of Elon Musk's compensation package. Despite disappointing results in the past year, with shares down 29% and valued at $571bn, Tesla saw a rise of 3% on Thursday following Musk's post. The chairperson Robyn Denholm played an essential role in this outcome by emphasizing that Musk had met share price and financial targets set out in the original 2018 package.

Musk, who also runs SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI, has publicly threatened to develop future AI products outside Tesla if his stake does not increase. He believes that a minimum of 25% is necessary for protecting the company from activists or hostile takeovers.

The final voting data on Musk's compensation package will likely be released on Friday, with Vanguard and BlackRock having already supported both resolutions. The next stage in this saga involves a hearing in Delaware early next month to consider the $5.2bn fee request made by winning lawyers.

Despite Tesla's plans to reincorporate in Texas, it is not expected that this will have any bearing on the pay decision as local courts must still respect the Delaware ruling. The passage ends with a celebratory mood at an event in Austin where Musk answered questions from shareholders and received praise online.
