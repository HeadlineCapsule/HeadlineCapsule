**意大利足球检察官驳回AC米兰出售案**

意大利足球检察官已经驳回了一起关于2022年美国对冲基金Elliott Management将AC米兰出售给纽约私募股权集团RedBird时涉嫌违规的案件。这一裁决由意大利监管机构FIGC（该国足球联合会）于上周五做出，使俱乐部免受即将到来的意大利Serie A联赛和欧洲Uefa Champions League锦标赛中的任何**罚分**。

这一决定可能削弱了米兰金融检察官领导的一项单独调查，后者此前声称尽管Elliott向私募股权集团出售了俱乐部，但RedBird并不是AC米兰的真正所有者。调查基于在AC米兰总部和其首席执行官Giorgio Furlani住所搜查中没收的文件。

AC Milan、Elliott Management和RedBird均否认这些**指控**，同时同意与调查人员充分合作。总部位于纽约的RedBird两年前以12亿欧元的价格从Elliott手中收购了AC米兰。此后，俱乐部重返意大利和欧洲足球顶级行列，近二十年来首次实现盈利。

俱乐部估值已增至14.4亿欧元，比一年前增长35.5%。AC Milan最近宣布Paulo Fonseca为新任教练，前足球明星Zlatan Ibrahimović担任RedBird的高级顾问。在美国老板的领导下，AC米兰专注于创造历史和赢得奖杯，在上个月失去Serie A冠军给Inter Milan后。

总结：
- 意大利足球检察官驳回了关于Elliott Management向RedBird出售AC米兰时涉嫌违规的案件。
- 决定使俱乐部免受即将到来的比赛中的**罚分**，削弱了由米兰金融检察官领导的单独调查。
- RedBird并非真正所有者的**指控**被否认；各方同意与调查人员合作。
- 自从被RedBird收购以来，AC Milan估值增加，现在在新教练和高级顾问的带领下专注于赢得奖杯。

 **Italian Football Prosecutor Dismisses Case Over AC Milan Sale**  

The Italian football prosecutor has dismissed a case concerning alleged irregularities over the 2022 sale of AC Milan by US hedge fund Elliott Management to New York private equity group RedBird. The ruling, made on Friday by Italy's supervisory authority FIGC (the country's football federation), spares the club from any penalties in the upcoming Italian Serie A league and European Uefa Champions League tournament.

The decision may weaken a separate probe into the sale led by Milan’s financial prosecutor, who had previously claimed that RedBird was not the true owner of the club despite Elliott's sale to the private equity group. The investigation was based on documents seized during raids at AC Milan headquarters and the residence of its chief executive, Giorgio Furlani.

AC Milan, Elliott Management, and RedBird have all denied these allegations while agreeing to fully cooperate with investigators. New York-based RedBird acquired AC Milan from Elliott two years ago for €1.2 billion. Since then, the club has returned to the top ranks of Italian and European football, turning a profit for the first time in nearly two decades.

The club's valuation has increased to €1.44 billion, up 35.5% from a year ago. AC Milan recently announced Paulo Fonseca as their new coach, with former football star Zlatan Ibrahimović serving as RedBird’s senior adviser. Under the US owners' leadership, AC Milan is focused on making history and winning trophies after losing the Serie A title last month to Inter Milan.

In summary:  
- Italian football prosecutor dismisses case over alleged irregularities in AC Milan sale by Elliott Management to RedBird.
- Decision spares club from penaltamoins in upcoming tournaments, weakens separate probe led by Milan's financial prosecutor.
- Allegations of RedBird not being true owner denied; all parties agreeing to cooperate with investigators.
- AC Milan valuation increased since acquisition by RedBird, now focused on winning trophies under new coach and senior adviser.
