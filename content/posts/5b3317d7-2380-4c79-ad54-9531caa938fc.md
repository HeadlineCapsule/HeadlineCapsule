## 葡萄牙国家航空公司总裁敦促政府在出售后保留股份



作为葡萄牙的旗舰航****空**公司，TAP的首席执行官**Luís Rodrigues**呼吁政府在其准备私有化时保留公司在**国有企业**中的股份。随着中右翼少数派政府的最近当选，有计划将TAP **100%卖出**,而之前的管理层曾表示这一比例将超过50%。Rodrigues建议采取渐进的方式，并强调了保持里斯本作为枢纽机场以及服务于葡萄牙自治岛屿的重要性。他提出可以吸引私募股权投资者或其他投资者，而不是直接出售给一家航空公司，从而解决布鲁塞尔的竞争担忧。由于TAP与巴西、南美和非洲有着紧密的联系，欧洲三大航空公司集团之一的IAG和汉莎航空表达了收购兴趣,**欧盟监管机构正在仔细审查这些交易**。Rodrigues预计TAP品牌将持续下去，并希望这一进程能在2025年前结束，但他承认前面仍有挑战。葡萄牙政府出售TAP的决定引发了关于行业整合和私募股权在航空业作用的讨论。

# Portugal’s national airline boss urges state to keep stake after sell-off


**Luís Rodrigues**, chief executive of **TAP**, Portugal's flag carrier airline, has urged the government to retain a stake in the company as it prepares for privatization. With the recent election of a center-right minority government, there are plans to sell off 100% of TAP, which was previously stated by the previous administration to be more than 50%. Rodrigues recommends a gradual approach and highlights the importance of maintaining **Lisbon** as a hub airport and serving Portugal's autonomous islands. He suggests involving private equity or other investors rather than selling directly to one airline, addressing competition concerns in Brussels. The **EU regulators are scrutinizing deals by IAG and Lufthansa**, two of Europe's big three airline groups, who have expressed interest in TAP due to its strong links to Brazil and South America, as well as Africa. Rodrigues expects the TAP brand to endure and hopes for a conclusion to the process by 2025 but acknowledges the challenges ahead. The Portuguese government's decision to privatize TAP has sparked discussions on industry consolidation and the role of private equity in the aviation sector.
