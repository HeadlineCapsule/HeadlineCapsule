德国极右翼驱逐纳粹党卫军辩护人出欧洲议会党团

# 德国另类选择党（AfD）驱逐了欧洲议会代表团的领先候选人马克斯·克拉赫。

**摘要：**
德国右翼政党德国另类选择党（AfD）在周一欧洲议会代表团的就职会议上，驱逐了该党欧盟选举的领先候选人马克斯·克拉赫（Maximilian Krah）。此前，克拉赫关于武装党卫军成员的争议性言论引起了公愤。这一举动被视为该党试图与前盟友和玛丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）的法国国民联盟党和解，并加入欧洲议会“身份与民主”集团。克拉赫声称并非所有武装党卫军成员都是罪犯，这引起了人们的愤怒，导致他被排除在AfD代表团之外。AfD希望能够重新加入ID集团，但这可能具有挑战性。

**要点：**
- 马克斯·克拉赫因关于武装党卫军成员的争议性言论而被德国另类选择党（AfD）驱逐。
- 这一举动被视为该党试图与前盟友和玛丽娜·勒庞的法国国民联盟党和解。
- AfD希望能够重新加入“身份与民主”集团，但这可能具有挑战性。
- 克拉赫声称并非所有武装党卫军成员都是罪犯，这引起了人们的愤怒。
- 克拉赫被驱逐出AfD代表团，导致AfD代表团将由14名而不是15名欧洲议会议员组成。
- 克拉赫认为他被排除在AfD代表团之外是一个战略错误，并声称他对其他AfD欧洲议会议员没有影响。
- AfD在欧盟选举中排名第二，得票率为15.9%，超过了奥拉夫·朔尔茨（Olaf Scholz）联盟中的所有三个政党，但由于克拉赫的争议，该党失去了五个席位。

 **Summary:**  
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) expelled Maximilian Krah, its lead candidate for the EU elections, from its delegation to the European parliament after he made controversial remarks about SS members. The move was seen as an attempt to reconcile with former allies and Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National party in the Identity and Democracy group of the European parliament. Krah had caused outrage by stating that not all SS members were criminals, leading to his exclusion from the AfD delegation. The hope is for the AfD to be readmitted into the ID group, though it may prove challenging.
