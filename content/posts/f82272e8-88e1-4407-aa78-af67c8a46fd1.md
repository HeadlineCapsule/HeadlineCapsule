# 通胀方面的好消息，但不太乐观

**4 月份的核心通胀** 同比下降 **0.3%**（或年化 **3.6%**），这是 2024 年首次下降，这表明通胀出现了**明显改善**。然而，这一积极发展并未对市场对**利率削减**的预期产生显著影响，期货市场预计到 12 月份仅略微提高削减幅度。文章将此归因于市场表现出**缓解**而不是**惊讶**，因为有充分理由预计 4 月份的数字会更好。

作者强调，美联储主要关注**服务价格**，因为服务价格持续攀升。尽管 4 月份商品价格有所改善，尤其是汽车价格，但在服务方面也有些好消息，包括机票和汽车保险。最重要的服务类别**住房**显示租金明显下降，自有住房租金替代成本略有下降。

从更宏观的角度来看，文章强调需要保持客观。4 月份的改善只是一个月的时间，我们仍高于美联储 2% 的目标。多月平均值仍远高于此目标，表明还有更多工作要做，前进道路可能不会一帆风顺。

文章还讨论了近期**黄金价格上涨**，作者认为从基本面来看难以解释。他们承认，各央行稳步转向黄金配置是重要因素，但警告称，近期黄金价格上涨也反映了投机热潮。

# Good, not great, news on inflation

April saw a **meaningful improvement** in inflation, with the month-over-month change in **core inflation** dropping to 0.3 percent (or 3.6 percent annualized), the first decline in 2024. This positive development, however, did not significantly impact the market's expectations for **interest rate cuts**, with the futures market predicting only a slight increase in cuts by December. The article attributes this to the market demonstrating **relief** rather than **surprise**, as there were already good reasons to expect better numbers in April. 

The author highlights that the Federal Reserve's main concern is **services prices**, which have continued to climb. While April showed improvements in goods, particularly car prices, there was also some encouraging news on the services side, including airfares and car insurance. The most critical service category, **shelter**, showed a nice drop in rent and a slight decline in owners' equivalent rent. 

Looking at the bigger picture, the article emphasizes the need to keep things in perspective. April's improvement is just one month, and we remain above the Fed's 2 percent target. The multi-month averages are still well above this target, indicating that there is more work to be done and the path forward may not be smooth. 

The article also discusses the recent **rally in gold**, which the author finds challenging to justify fundamentally. They acknowledge that central banks' steady shift towards gold allocations is a significant factor, but caution that the recent jump in gold prices also reflects a speculative frenzy.
