俄罗斯制裁措施无效，迪拜贸易中心负责人如是说

# 摘要：

这篇文章讨论了根据迪拜多商品中心（DMCC）主席哈马德·布阿米姆（Hamad Buamim）的说法，对俄罗斯的制裁是无效的。他指出，这些措施并没有阻止与莫斯科的贸易，而是将贸易转移到其他地方。由于在乌克兰战争中对俄罗斯实施制裁，导致石油交易商和企业搬迁到阿联酋，因此阿联酋从中受益。布阿米姆强调，制裁使贸易更加复杂，但没有显著影响西方以外的全球商业。

# 问题：

1. 迪拜的地理位置如何促进了其作为美国和欧洲试图孤立俄罗斯经济的受益者的角色？

   答案：由于位于东西方之间的战略位置，迪拜利用这一优势成为世界商业的重要节点。对俄罗斯实施制裁促使石油交易商和企业从日内瓦搬迁到阿联酋，从而使迪拜的经济活动显著增加。这种转变在能源等行业尤为明显，大约有3000家公司在DMCC自由贸易区注册。

2. 哈马德·布阿米姆认为全球商业面临哪些挑战，这些挑战与当前的地缘政治紧张局势有何关系？

   答案：布阿米姆认为，全球化和气候变化是全球商业面临的日益严重的挑战，而物流管理中人工智能的应用则抵消了这些挑战。他还强调，保护主义正在成为政治议程上的优先事项，导致做出对全球经济来说不具有商业可行性的决定。此外，他指出美国和中国之间的紧张局势日益加剧，这影响着世界各地的企业，并强调这一挑战远远超出了这两个国家。

3. 哈马德·布阿米姆如何看待对俄罗斯制裁在西方以外地区的效果？

   答案：根据布阿米姆的说法，对俄罗斯实施的制裁在全球贸易中，特别是在西方世界之外，效果有限。他认为，这些措施可能会减慢俄罗斯经济的发展，但并不能完全阻止它，只是以不同的方式重定向贸易流动。他的观点表明，制裁比最初认为的更加复杂，其影响在西方以外并没有那么显著。

**Summary:**  
The article discusses how sanctions on Russia are ineffective, according to Hamad Buamim, chair of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC). He states that while these measures do not halt trade with Moscow, they simply redirect it elsewhere. The UAE has benefited from the relocation of oil traders and businesses due to sanctions imposed on Russia over the war in Ukraine. Buamim emphasizes that sanctions make trade more complex without significantly impacting global commerce outside the West.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: How has Dubai's geographical position contributed to its role as a beneficiary of US and European attempts to isolate Russia’s economy?  
A1: Due to its strategic location between East and West, Dubai has leveraged this advantage by becoming an important node for world commerce. As sanctions on Russia have prompted oil traders and businesses to relocate from Geneva to the UAE, Dubai'cuhas seen a significant increase in economic activity. This shift is particularly evident in sectors such as energy, where around 3,000 companies are registered within the DMCC free trade zone.

Q2: What challenges does Hamad Buamim identify for global commerce and how do they relate to current geopolitical tensions?  
A2: Buamim identifies deglobalization and climate change as increasing challenges for global commerce, which are balanced by the use of AI in logistics management. He also highlights that protectionism is becoming a priority on political agendas, leading to decisions not commercially viable for the global economy. Furthermore, he points out the growing tension between the US and China as an issue affecting businesses worldwide, emphasizing that this challenge extends beyond just these two countries.

Q3: How does Hamad Buamim view the effectiveness of sanctions on Russia in terms of their impact outside the West?  
A3: According to Buamim, sanctions imposed on Russia have limited effectiveness when it comes to global trade outside the Western world. He argues that while these measures may slow down the Russian economy, they do not stop it entirely and merely redirect trade flows in different ways. This perspective suggests that sanctions are more complex than initially perceived and their impact is not as significant on a global scale beyond the West.
