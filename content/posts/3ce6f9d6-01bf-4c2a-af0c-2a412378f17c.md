工党抵制关闭英国税收漏洞的呼吁，该漏洞被Shein利用

### **工党抵制关闭谢恩利用的税收漏洞的呼吁**

工党正在抵制税收活动家和零售竞争对手的呼吁，要求关闭由这家中国创立的时尚快消公司谢恩（Shein）利用的税收漏洞。这家有争议的在线零售商计划在伦敦上市，预计估值为500亿英镑，如果工党在即将到来的7月选举中获胜，这将对其亲商业信誉是一个重大考验。

这个税收漏洞允许像谢恩这样的公司通过直接向客户发送小包裹而不是通过分销中心来避免进口关税。英国零售商和倡导团体认为这种做法是不公平的，因为它使他们处于与利用这一漏洞的仅在线上运营的竞争对手相比的不利地位。

尽管受到各利益相关方的压力，工党表示如果当选，他们没有计划关闭这个税收漏洞。该党认为，谢恩在伦敦证券交易所上市将实施更高的监管标准并有利于英国经济。然而，该党内部的一些人私下承认，无论谢恩是否在英国上市，都需要解决这个问题。

批评人士认为，像谢恩这样的跨国公司利用不公平的漏洞，牺牲了较小竞争对手和当地企业的利益。零售企业家西奥·帕菲蒂斯（Theo Paphitis）对政府尚未堵上这个巨大的税收漏洞感到震惊。

除了对税收漏洞的担忧外，谢恩还面临其供应链中存在强迫劳动的指控，该公司对此予以否认。工党官员表示，他们将在涉及国际安全时采取强硬立场，但并不认为谢恩的案例属于这种情况。

谢恩声称其完全遵守所有税收政策，并支付了企业所得税、增值税和就业税等适用税款。

 ### **Labour Party Resists Calls to Close Tax Loophole Used by Shein**

The Labour party is resisting calls from tax campaigners and retail rivals to close a tax loophole used by the Chinese-founded fast fashion company, Shein. The controversial online retailer plans to float in London with an estimated valuation of £50bn, which would be a significant test for Labour's pro-business credentials if they win the upcoming July election.

The tax loophole allows companies like Shein to avoid import duties by shipping small packages directly to customers instead of through distribution centers. UK retailers and advocacy groups argue that this practice is unfair, as it puts them at a disadvantage compared to online-only competitors who exploit the loophole.

Despite pressure from various stakeholders, Labour has stated that they have no plans to close the tax loophole if elected. The party believes that listing Shein on the London Stock Exchange would impose higher regulatory standards and benefit the UK economy. However, some within the party privately acknowledge the need to address the issue regardless of whether Shein lists in the UK or not.

Critics argue that multinational corporations like Shein take advantage of unfair loopholes at the expense of smaller rivals and local businesses. Theo Paphitis, a retail entrepreneur, expressed disbelief that the government has yet to clamp down on this gaping tax loophole.

In addition to concerns about the tax loophole, Shein faces allegations of forced labor in its supply chain, which it denies. Labour officials have stated that they would take a tough stance on Chinese investment where international security is involved but do not consider Shein's case as such.

Shein maintains that it is fully compliant with all tax policies and pays applicable taxes including corporation tax, VAT, and employment taxes.
