# 欧盟极左翼领袖呼吁联合对抗极右翼

**欧洲议会**中**左翼集团**的联席领袖**马农·奥布里**呼吁进步政党在下个月的**欧洲选举**之前形成广泛的**左翼联盟**。此举是针对选民向右翼转变的民意调查结果，预测**极右翼欧洲保守派和改革主义者组织(ECR)**和**极右翼身份与民主组织(ID)**都将获得席位。奥布里批评了议会中第二大的中间偏左的**社会党**，指责他们愿意与**中间偏右的欧洲人民党(EPP)**妥协，她认为统一的左翼可以将欧洲政治拉回中间派。她强调，左翼、社会党、绿党和自由派联合起来，成功通过了关于**企业供应链尽职调查**的规则。奥布里还认为，左翼的力量和团结改善了**零工经济工人**的处境。然而，她也表达了对某些国家向中间派转变的社会党失去选票并流向极右翼的担忧。与此同时，德国人平均工作时间短，引发了关于鼓励延长工作周的讨论。另外，希腊和土耳其的关系有所改善，希腊总理**基里亚科斯·米佐塔基斯**和土耳其总统**雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安**强调了对话，尽管在加沙冲突等问题上存在不同意见。

# Unite against the right, urges EU far-left leader

**Manon Aubry**, co-leader of the **Left group** in the **European Parliament**, has called for a broad **left-wing alliance** among progressive parties ahead of the **European elections** next month. This call comes in response to polls indicating a rightward shift among voters, with predicted gains for both the **hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR)** and the **far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) groups**. Aubry criticized the center-left **Socialists**, the second-largest group in the parliament, for their willingness to compromise with the **center-right European People's Party (EPP)**, arguing that a united left could pull European politics back towards the center. She highlighted the success of a recent coalition between the Left, Socialists, Greens, and liberals in passing rules on **corporate supply chain due diligence**. Aubry also attributed improvements in conditions for **gig economy workers** to the strength and unity of the left. However, she expressed concern about the Socialists' loss of votes to the far right in some countries due to their move towards the center. Meanwhile, Germany's short average working hours have prompted discussions on encouraging longer workweeks. In other news, Greek-Turkish relations have improved, with Greek Prime Minister **Kyriakos Mitsotakis** and Turkish President **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan** emphasizing dialogue despite differing opinions on issues such as the conflict in Gaza.
