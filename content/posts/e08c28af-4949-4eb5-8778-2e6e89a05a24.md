伊朗推举强硬派作为总统候选人

# 伊朗总统选举：

**候选人审查机构**  Guardian Council 已取消了多位知名温和派候选人的资格，同时批准了五位强硬派候选人以及一位改革派议员 Masoud Pezeshkian 的参选资格。这一决定缩小了伊朗即将举行的补缺总统选举的潜在领导人的范围，此前由于总统 Ebrahim Raisi 去世，选举定于本月晚些时候举行。

**被取消资格的候选人**：该委员会取消了 Ali Larijani 和 Es’haq Jahangiri 的资格，他们都是温和派人物，在竞选活动中承诺将国家从目前的强硬路线上拉回来，并寻求美国放宽制裁。没有给出取消他们资格的原因。

**获批准的候选人**：获批准的候选人包括现任议会议长 Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf；前核问题谈判代表 Saeed Jalili，他因反对与西方大国接触而闻名；以及改革派议员 Masoud Pezeshkian。

**改革派面临的挑战**：改革派的主要挑战是动员选民参加选举，因为人们普遍怀疑选举会对伊朗的未来方向产生影响，真正的权力在于最高领袖阿亚图拉阿里·哈梅内伊。如果 Pezeshkian 获胜，需要城市中产阶级的高投票率，并取决于硬线阵营中候选人之间的选票分配情况。

**经济挑战**：经济仍然是伊朗下届总统面临的首要挑战，高通货膨胀和大幅贬值的货币给国家造成了巨大压力。

**竞选动态**：哈梅内伊敦促候选人不要在选举活动期间相互攻击，竞选活动将于周三开始。预计改革派将在选举前两周全力支持 Pezeshkian。

 **Iran's Presidential Election**: The Guardian Council, responsible for vetting election candidates, has disqualified prominent moderates and approved five hardline candidates along with one reformist MP, Masoud Pezeshkian. This decision narrows the field of potential leaders in Iran's upcoming snap presidential elections scheduled later this month following President Ebrahim Raisi's death.

**Disqualified Candidates**: The council disqualified Ali Larijani and Es’haq Jahangiri, both moderate figures who had campaigned on platforms promising to steer the country away from its current hardline trajectory and seek easing of US sanctions. No reasons were provided for these disqualifications.

**Approved Candidates**: Among those approved are Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the current parliamentary Speaker; Saeed Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator known for his opposition to engaging with western powers; and Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist member of parliament.

**Challenges for Reformists**: The main challenge for reformists will be mobilizing their voters amid widespread skepticism about the election's impact on Iran's future direction due to real power lying with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A victory for Pezeshkian would require a high turnout among the urban middle class and depend on how votes for hardliners are shared among candidates in that camp.

**Economic Challenges**: The economy remains the foremost challenge for Iran's next president, with high inflation and a dramatically weakened national currency straining the nation.

**Campaign Dynamics**: Khamenei has urged candidates not to undermine each other during the election campaign, which will begin on Wednesday. Reformists are expected to throw their full weight behind Pezeshkian in the two weeks before the election.
