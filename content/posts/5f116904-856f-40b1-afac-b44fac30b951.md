## 消费信心在全球多个主要经济体中低迷不振

文章讨论了澳大利亚、巴西、**中国**、丹麦、欧盟、法国、德国、意大利、日本、西班牙、英国和美国的**消费者信心**。尽管这些国家的经济都恢复增长，但多种因素导致消费者士气仍**低落**。首先，在过去四年中，家庭一直承受着物价上涨带来的压力，消费陷入停滞，这种趋势是自全球金融危机以来未曾见过的。其次，工资未能跟上通货膨胀的步伐，导致消费者购买力和可支配收入下降。

文章还提到，**反复出现的意外冲击**，例如疫情、生活成本危机、地缘政治紧张局势等，再加上收紧的货币政策，都造成了这种悲观情绪。在对欧元区、英国和美国的经济增长预期部分中，文章预测美国将比欧洲国家有更强劲的扩张。

The article discusses consumer confidence across different economies such as Australia, Brazil, China, Denmark, EU, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and US. It highlights that despite returning growth to their respective economies, consumer morale remains low due to various factors. Firstly, households are still under pressure from high prices resulting in stagnant consumption over the past four years - a trend unseen since the global financial crisis. Secondly, wages have failed to keep up with inflation leading to lower purchasing power and disposable income for consumers. The article also mentions that repeated unexpected shocks such as pandemic, cost of living crisis, geopolitical tensions etc., along with tighter monetary policies contribute towards this gloomy sentiment. It concludes by providing forecasts for economic growth in Eurozone, UK, and US highlighting a stronger expansion predicted for the latter compared to its European counterparts.
