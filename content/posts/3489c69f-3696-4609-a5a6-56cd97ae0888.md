现在BHP和英美合并的可能性有多大？

# 英美公司（Anglo American）的最新动态

## 1）英美公司的铜矿价值显著
由于铜在电气化经济中的重要作用以及本十年后期预计将出现短缺，英美公司（**Anglo**）旗下铜矿的价值凸显。铜价波动较大，一度飙升至每吨超11000美元的历史高位，随后回落至约每吨10300美元，推动了铜生产商股票的上涨。

## 2）必和必拓（BHP）拟收购英美公司
**BHP** 提议收购英美公司尚未最终确定，可能因格伦核心（Glencore）等新竞购者的加入或英美公司董事会接受更好报价而发生变化。目前，来自 BHP 的全股要约估值英美公司为386亿英镑，但该交易结构引发了担忧。

## 3）南非公共投资公司（PIC）提出异议
作为英美公司的第二大股东，**南非公共投资公司（PIC）**要求对BHP的报价进行“有意义的修改”，并强调了该拟议交易所涉及的重大风险。 PIC 对与 BHP 展开接触持开放态度。

## 4）潜在竞标者可能带来挑战
如果 BHP 和英美公司达成收购协议，仍可能会面临其他潜在竞标者的挑战。分析师（如 Jeffries 的 Chris LaFemina）指出，格伦核心可能成为竞争对手出价方。

## 5）BHP的最后决定期限未定
根据提供的信息，目前还不清楚 BHP 何时需要做出最终决定：是正式提出要约还是退出竞标。

Based on the information provided in the text:

1) The value of Anglo's copper mines is significant due to their importance in electrifying the global economy and predicted shortages later this decade. Copper prices have been volatile, reaching an all-time high above $11,000 per tonne before dropping back down to around $10,300 per tonne. This has pushed shares of copper producers higher.

2) BHP's proposed takeover of Anglo American is not final and may be subject to change based on various factors such as the entry of a new interloper like Glencore or if the Anglo board recommends a better offer. The current all-share offer from BHP values Anglo at £38.6bn, but there are concerns about its structure.

3) South Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which is Anglo American's second-largest shareholder, has demanded a "meaningful revision" to BHP's offer and highlighted the material risks associated with the proposed transaction. The PIC remains open to engaging with BHP for the first time.

4) If an agreement on the takeover is reached between BHP and Anglo American, there may still be challenges ahead as other potential bidders could enter the scene. Glencore has been suggested as a possible rival bidder by analysts like Chris LaFemina from Jefferies.

5) The deadline for BHP to make a formal offer or walk away is set, but it's unclear when this date will be reached based on the information provided in the text.
