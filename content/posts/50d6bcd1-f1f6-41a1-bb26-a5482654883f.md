因美国制裁，俄罗斯停止外汇交易

# 摘要：
本文讨论了俄罗斯因美国制裁而做出的一项决定，即因其主要交易所（莫斯科交易所）被针对而停止以美元和欧元进行外汇交易。这些变化使卢布的定价更加不透明，影响了可转换性，并提高了进出口商的成本。

# 要点：
- 由于美国制裁的目标是莫斯科交易所，俄罗斯央行停止了该交易所以美元和欧元进行的交易。
- 卢布的定价现在将反映银行间交易，使其更加不透明，影响进出口商的可转换性。
- 与俄罗斯进行交易的银行面临被切断与美国金融体系联系的二级制裁风险。
- 分析师预计，与制裁前相比，卢布将下跌，同时买入和卖出价格之间的差额显著增加。
- 周四，俄罗斯外汇经纪商暂停了美元和欧元账户的取款。
- 将所有美元和欧元交易转移到银行间市场将导致更宽的价格差和更大的卢布波动性，影响普通民众从俄罗斯转移资金的能力。
- 进出口商面临购买外币的额外成本，而出口商必须将大部分收入转换为卢布。
- 对汇率的心理影响不容忽视，因为它是俄罗斯经济健康状况的关键指标。
- 由于过去卢布贬值的经历，俄罗斯人习惯于以美元或欧元持有储蓄。
- 建议的缓解措施：从美元和欧元等“有毒”的国际交易货币转向人民币，截至5月，人民币在俄罗斯外币交易中占比超过50%。然而，由于二级制裁风险，人民币也出现了问题。

# 建议：
- 关注美国和俄罗斯关系的发展及其对全球金融市场的潜在影响。
- 关注与其他国家银行交易的俄罗斯银行的反应，因为它们可能面临来自美国的二级制裁。
- 观察俄罗斯人在货币偏好上的任何转变及其对外汇交易动态的影响。

 **Summary:**  
The article discusses Russia's decision to halt foreign exchange trading in dollars and euros on its main exchange due to escalated US sanctions targeting links between the Russian financial system and foreign banks. The changes have made pricing of the rouble more opaque, affecting convertibility and raising costs for importers and exporters.

**Key Points:**  
- Russia's central bank halted trading in dollars and euros on its main exchange (Moscow Exchange) after US sanctions targeted the marketplace.
- The rouble pricing will now reflect interbank transactions, making it more opaque and affecting convertibility for importers and exporters.
- Banks transacting with Russia face risks of secondary sanctions that could cut them off from the US financial system.
- Analysts expect the rouble to fall by amoors compared to pre-sanction levels, while spreads between buying and selling prices have increased significantly.
- Russian foreign exchange brokers suspended withdrawals from dollar and euro accounts on Thursday.
- The shift of all dollar and euro trading to the interbank market will result in wider price spreads and greater rouble volatility, impacting ordinary people's ability to transfer money out of Russia.
- Importers face additional costs for purchasing foreign currency, while exporters must convert most of their earnings into roubles.
- The psychological effect on the exchange rate should not be underestimated as it is a key indicator of economic health in Russia.
- Russians are accustomed to holding savings in dollars or euros due to past experiences with rouble devaluation.
- Recommended mitigation: Pivoting from "toxic" internationally traded currencies like the dollar and euro towards the renminbi, which accounted for over 50% of foreign currency trading in Russia as of May. However, issues with the renminbi are emerging due to secondary sanctions risks.

**Recommendations:**  
- Monitor developments regarding US and Russian relations and potential impacts on global financial markets.
- Keep an eye on how other countries' banks transacting with Russia respond to these changes, as they may face secondary sanctions from the US.
- Observe any shifts in currency preferences among Russians and their implications for foreign exchange trading dynamics.
