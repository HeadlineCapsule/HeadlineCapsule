汤姆·海耶斯将请求英国最高法院考虑利宝率操纵的上诉。

# **汤姆·海耶斯（Tom Hayes）**的长期法律斗争：洗清罪名的大好机会？ 

## 摘要:
作为全球首个因合谋操纵**伦敦银行同业拆借利率（Libor）**被定罪的人，前交易员汤姆·海耶斯（Tom Hayes）被英国**上诉法院**拒绝许可将他的案件上诉至**英国最高法院**。然而，法院承认了一个 **"具有普遍重要性的法律要点 "**，为海耶斯提供了继续上诉的法律依据。这种罕见的认证允许他直接向最高法院申请审理，以推翻他的定罪。 

海耶斯服刑了五年半，一直坚称他和其他交易员一起被**英国重大欺诈案审查局（SFO）**当作**替罪羊**。由于软件问题，SFO 对 Libor 操纵事件的审查也可能影响到海耶斯的案件，因为该审查将调查在调查过程中是否有任何文件被遗漏。 

上诉法院3月份的裁决维持了对海耶斯有罪的原判，并援引了证据和不诚实认罪。然而，核心法律问题依然存在：受交易优势影响的** Libor 利率**本身是否具有欺骗性？最高法院现在有机会对此问题作出澄清，这对类似案件可能产生影响。 

## 问与答: 
- 上诉法院拒绝将该案转交英国最高法院，这具有什么意义，它对汤姆·海耶斯的法律选择产生了怎样的影响? 

    **答案:** 尽管上诉法院的决定阻碍了通往最高法院的标准路线，但他们承认的 **"具有普遍重要性的法律要点 "**提供了一条替代路径。这种罕见的情况允许海耶斯直接向最高法院提出审理他的案件的请求，为他洗清罪名提供了潜在的可能性。 

- 为什么汤姆·海耶斯试图推翻定罪，而英国重大欺诈案审查局（SFO）在其中扮演什么角色? 

    **答案:** 汤姆·海耶斯坚称自己受到了 SFO的不公平对待，成为了 Libor 操纵丑闻的替罪羊。该丑闻涉及多家银行和交易员。SFO成功起诉了包括海耶斯在内共9人参与合谋欺诈。然而，由于软件问题而对 Libor 案件进行的审查有可能影响这些定罪，因为它可能会发现调查过程中遗漏了相关文件。 

- 上诉法院3月份的有罪裁决依据是什么，他们提出了哪些论点? 

    **答案:** 上诉法院维持了对海耶斯有罪的原判，引用了其操纵 Libor 利率的 **"不可争辩的书面证据 "**，并指出了他自己承认的不诚实行为。他们断言，任何受交易优势影响的 Libor 利率报价都可以被认为是不诚实或非真实

# **Tom Hayes**' Long Legal Battle: A Chance to Clear His Name? 

## Summary:
Former trader Tom Hayes, the first person globally convicted for conspiring to rig the **Libor** (**London Interbank Offered Rate**), has been denied permission by the **Court of Appeal** to take his case to the **UK Supreme Court**. However, the court acknowledged a "**point of law of general public importance**," keeping Hayes' legal options open. This rare certification now allows him to make a direct application to the Supreme Court for a hearing, in his quest to overturn his conviction. 

Hayes spent five and a half years in prison and has consistently argued that he was made a **scapegoat**, alongside other traders, by the **Serious Fraud Office (SFO)**. The SFO's review of Libor prosecutions, due to software issues, could also potentially impact Hayes' case as it examines if any documents were missed during investigations. 

The Court of Appeal's March verdict upheld Hayes' guilty verdict, citing evidence and admissions of dishonesty. Yet, the central legal question remains: are **Libor rates** influenced by trading advantages inherently dishonest? The Supreme Court now has the opportunity to provide clarity on this issue with potential implications for similar cases. 

## Questions & Answers: 
- What is the significance of the Court of Appeal's refusal to refer the case to the UK Supreme Court, and how does it impact Tom Hayes' legal options? 

   **Answer:** Although the Court of Appeal's decision blocks the standard route to the Supreme Court, their acknowledgment of a "point of law of general public importance" opens an alternative path. This rare occurrence allows Hayes to directly petition the Supreme Court for a hearing on his case, providing a potential avenue for him to clear his name. 

- Why is Tom Hayes seeking to overturn his conviction, and what role did the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) play in his case? 

   **Answer:**  Tom Hayes maintains that he was unfairly targeted by the SFO as a scapegoat for the Libor rigging scandal, which involved multiple banks and traders. The SFO successfully prosecuted nine individuals, including Hayes, for conspiracy to defraud. However, their current review of Libor prosecutions due to software issues could potentially impact these convictions if it is found that relevant documents were missed during investigations. 

- What was the basis for the Court of Appeal's guilty verdict in March, and what arguments did they present? 

   **Answer:** The Court of Appeal upheld Hayes' conviction, citing "indisputable documentary evidence" of his attempts to manipulate Libor rates and noting his own admissions of dishonest behavior. They asserted that any Libor rate submission influenced by trading advantages could be considered inherently dishonest or not a genuine answer. 

- What are the potential implications if the Supreme Court agrees to hear this case? 

   **Answer:** If the Supreme Court takes on this case, their decision could have far-reaching consequences for similar financial fraud cases and provide clarity on the legal interpretation of Libor rate manipulation influenced by trading advantages. It may also impact how regulatory bodies like the SFO handle future investigations and prosecutions related to financial misconduct. 

- What is the current status of Tom Hayes' legal battle, and what are his plans moving forward? 

   **Answer:**  With the Court of Appeal's recent decision, Tom Hayes now has the opportunity to directly petition the UK Supreme Court to hear his case. His legal team, led by solicitor Karen Todner, intends to "continue to do everything in their power" to overturn his conviction, believing it to be a miscarriage of justice. 

- Are there any similar cases or appeals related to Libor rigging that have been successful? 

   **Answer:**  While the article does not provide specific examples, it mentions that eight other individuals, including Carlo Palombo (a former Barclays trader convicted of manipulating Euribor rates),
