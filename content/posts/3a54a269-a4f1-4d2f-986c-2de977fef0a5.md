# 我能要求在家族企业中获得比继承份额更大的股份吗？

此情况可能与 **所有权禁令** 相关，这是一个法律概念。 如果有人承诺过继承 **家族企业** 但未履行，该概念允许法院介入。 在此类案件中，法院会考虑这些承诺的影响以及个人对该企业的投入。 如果你感到自己受到不公正对待，你可以采取法律行动，但结果将取决于各种因素，包括你从公司获得的工资和福利。

关于你对你的前夫成为你老板的担忧，必须区分是作为一家公司的员工，还是共同拥有并经营一家企业。 如果你们都是员工，你们的就业权利和合同条款通常受到保护，不应受离婚影响。 然而，如果你们共同拥有并经营着一家企业，可能需要达成协议，可能涉及用其他婚姻财产进行交换。 解决方案将取决于你们之间的矛盾程度、财务资源、未来收入需求，以及找到其他工作的容易程度。 替代性纠纷解决方法可以帮助解决这些复杂的问题。

# Can I claim a bigger stake in the family business than I have inherited? 

**_Proprietary estoppel_** is a legal concept that may be relevant to your situation. This allows the court to step in if promises or assurances regarding inheritance of a **family business** were made but not fulfilled. In such cases, the court considers the impact of these promises and the dedication of individuals to the business. If you feel wronged, you can pursue legal action, but the outcome will depend on various factors, including your salary and benefits received from the company.

Regarding your concern about your ex-husband being your boss, it is important to distinguish between being employees of a company and owning and running a business together. If you are both employees, your employment rights and contractual terms are generally protected and should not be influenced by your divorce. However, if you own and run the business together, a deal may need to be struck, potentially involving a trade-off with other marital assets. The resolution will depend on the acrimony between you, financial resources, future income needs, and the ease of obtaining alternative employment. Alternative dispute resolution methods can help navigate these complex issues.
