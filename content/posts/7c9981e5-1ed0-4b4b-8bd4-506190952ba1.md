阿奇·诺曼指责养老基金导致伦敦股市下跌

**阿奇·诺曼** 批评养老基金对伦敦股市下跌的影响。他归因于英国养老金计划投资减少和公司股票期权减少导致的长期低迷。

诺曼是 M&S 的主席和 Bridgepoint 董事会的成员，他认为**低风险的养老金投资**导致缺乏可用于国内股票的可用资本。他建议使用指数基金或私募资产等替代投资策略可以帮助解决养老金赤字，并为英国机构创造更多机会。

他还强调了公司股票期权减少的问题，指出 30 年前，高管通常通过工资、奖金和股票期权获得报酬。他认为这种做法在过去促进了股市繁荣和私营企业的增长。

由于公司寻求更高的估值和更深的资本市场，例如纽约，伦敦证券交易所面临着较少公司上市的挑战。然而，最近的迹象表明复兴的趋势，一些公司计划在 LSE 上市。

导致养老金对股票投资减少的一个重要因素是 2000 年进行的会计变动，导致定义福利计划出于负债匹配的目的从股票转向债券。根据 Ondra 咨询公司的说法，这导致了投资组合中股票敞口的减少。

诺曼还批评了自动注册计划，认为这是一个错失的机会，可以将储蓄引导到国内股票，并建议更多员工应该有机会获得像 Asda 之前提供的那些股票期权。

 **Archie Norman** criticizes pension funds' impact on London's stock market decline. He attributes the long-term malaise to reduced investments by UK pension schemes and the decrease in corporate share options. 

Norman, chair of M&S and board member at Bridgepoint, argues that **pensions invested for low risk** have led to a lack of available capital for domestic stocks. He suggests alternative investment strategies like index-trackers or private assets could help address pension deficits and create more opportunities in British institutions.

The decline of corporate share options is also highlighted, with Norman pointing out that 30 years ago, executives were commonly paid through salaries, bonuses, and stock options. He believes this practice contributed to a thriving stock market and the growth of private companies in the past.

The London Stock Exchange has faced challenges due to fewer corporate listings as companies seek higher valuations and deeper capital markets elsewhere, such as New York. However, recent signs indicate a revival with some firms planning to list on the LSE.

A significant factor contributing to reduced pension investments in equities is an accounting change made in 2000 that led defined benefit schemes to shift from equities to bonds for liability matching purposes. This has resulted in a decrease of equity exposure within portfolios, according to advisory firm Ondra.

Norman also criticizes the auto-enrolment scheme as a missed opportunity to channel savings into domestic stocks and suggests that more employees should have access to share options like those previously offered at Asda.
