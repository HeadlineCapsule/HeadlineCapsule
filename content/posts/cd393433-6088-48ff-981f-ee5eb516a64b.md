# 中国启动 1 万亿元人民币债券发行以提振经济

**中国当局**已启动了出售 **1 万亿元人民币（1400 亿美元）**长期债券来刺激经济的进程，由 **中国人民银行**牵头。此举旨在增加政府支出，以支持投资并在房地产危机持续期间提振经济。根据 **国家发展和改革委员会**副组长 **刘苏社**的说法，债券发行是融资的关键组成部分，对于资助对**经济现代化**至关重要的重大项目具有重要意义，这是更广泛战略的一部分。此次债券发行延续了 2020 年的类似模式，当时发行了长期债券以应对新冠疫情并增加基础设施投资。

这些新债券是**特殊主权债券**，与常规政府债券不同，因为它们是针对特定目的发行的。这是该类型债券的第四次发行，之前在 1998 年和 2007 年也进行了类似发行，但目的各不相同。预计此次发行将增强中国长期债券市场的流动性，而投资者历来会持有这些债券直至到期。中国正积极推动经济增长模式转型，摆脱对房地产和基础设施投资的过度依赖，这导致了**地方政府债务**大幅增加。

**中诚信国际信用评级公司**的 **左剑明**表示，此次债券发行的时机具有战略意义，契合了北京中央政府增加借贷同时解决地方政府债务问题的战略。左剑明还指出，未来十年可能还需要追加发行数万亿元人民币债券，以支持中央政府进一步增加投资。首批新债券预计规模将在 **800 亿至 1000 亿元人民币**之间，包括 **30 年和 50 年期债券**。**财政部**正积极与国务院和发改委等主要利益相关者协调此次发行事宜。

**中国人民银行**表示，当条件合适时，可能会考虑在二级市场购买这些债券，根据 **农业信贷银行**的 **支孝佳**的说法，此举可能增强央行对银行间利率的控制。预计此次债券发行将于 6 月开始，第三季度结束。预计投资者将保持对主权债券的投资热情，因为可投资的替代资产不足，即使债券供应量增加也不会影响投资者的热情。

# China fires starting gun on Rmb1tn debt sale to boost economy

**Chinese authorities** have initiated the process of selling **Rmb1tn ($140bn)** in long-dated bonds to stimulate the economy, with the **People's Bank of China** taking the lead. This move is aimed at increasing government spending to support investment and bolster the economy amid the ongoing property crisis. The bond sale is a critical component of a broader strategy to fund significant projects vital for **modernizing the economy**, according to **Liu Sushe**, deputy head of the **National Development and Reform Commission**. This sale follows a similar pattern observed in 2020, when long-dated bonds were issued to manage the Covid-19 pandemic and boost infrastructure investments. 

The new bonds are **special sovereign bonds**, distinct from regular government bonds, as they are issued for specific purposes. This issuance is the fourth of its kind, with previous rounds occurring in 1998 and 2007 for unique objectives. The sale is expected to enhance liquidity in the market for longer-dated Chinese bonds, which investors have traditionally held until maturity. China is actively working to transition its economic growth model away from a heavy reliance on property and infrastructure investment, which has resulted in a substantial increase in **local government debt**. 

The timing of this bond sale is strategic, according to **Jameson Zuo** of **CSPI Credit Rating Co**, as it aligns with Beijing's strategy of increasing central government borrowing while addressing the challenge of local government debt. Zuo also highlights the potential for trillions of yuan worth of additional bond issuance over the next decade to facilitate increased central government investments. The first batch of new bonds is expected to range between **Rmb80bn and Rmb100bn**, with a mix of **30-year and 50-year maturities**. The **Ministry of Finance** is actively coordinating the sale with other key stakeholders, including the state council and the NDRC. 

The **PBoC** has indicated its potential interest in purchasing these bonds on the secondary market when conditions are favorable, a move that could enhance its control over interbank rates, according to **Zhi Xiaojia** of **Crédit Agricole**. The sale is anticipated to commence in June and conclude by the third quarter. Investors are expected to maintain their appetite for sovereign bonds, even with the increased supply, due to a shortage of alternative investable assets.
