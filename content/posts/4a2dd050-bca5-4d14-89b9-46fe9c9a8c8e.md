The FT's Alexandra Heal, Benjamin Parkin, and DD's Will Louch conducted interviews with nearly 50 people who have worked with Builder.ai founder Sachin Dev Duggal. They described him as a brilliant storyteller and sharp intellect but also someone involved in various legal disputes throughout his career. Some interviewees mentioned that the company faces challenges, such as retaining staff due to its demanding culture and delivering products on time.

Builder.ai secured significant funding last year amidst investor interest in cutting-edge artificial intelligence startups. However, Duggal now needs to prove he can turn his buzzy idea into a successful business. At the Milken Institute conference, he warned about information asymmetry and hype surrounding AI companies that may not deliver on their promises.

The FT's story also includes an extravagant company "off-site" in Ho Chi Minh featuring former Apple executive Tony Fadell and Serena Williams's former tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou, as well as details from the interviews about Duggal's past business dealings.
