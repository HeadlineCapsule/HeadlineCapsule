# 美国铜价飙升至创纪录高位，资金大量涌入

**美国铜期货** 价格飙升，相比于伦敦设定的**全球基准**价格，每吨溢价超1000美元。这种非同寻常的价格走势归因于投机基金投资和交易员的空头回补，导致美英两国铜价差距巨大，前所未有。铜价上涨反映了**大宗商品**价格上涨的更广泛趋势，以及它们作为**对冲通胀**的吸引力日益增强，对资产管理者和对冲基金而言尤其如此。

对现有库存和可能出现轧空的担忧加剧了这种情况，类似事件发生在 2022 年 3 月的**镍市场**。由于禁止俄罗斯铜进口和美国进口面临物流挑战，市场可能面临供应短缺。这导致大宗商品交易商争相购买铜并平仓空头头寸。市场动态和极端价格波动的可能性吸引了投机者的注意，他们也推高了价格波动。

此外，铜矿巨头英美资源集团拟被必和必拓收购，以及中国可能出台刺激措施的消息，进一步助长了买盘狂热。分析师将美国铜价飙升归因于美国资金涌入大宗商品，凸显了市场脱节和基金购买影响力。这种情况表明大宗商品交易存在更广泛的波动性，交易商承担了总体成本的较大份额，供应中断可能会对价格产生过度影响。

# US Copper Prices Soar to Record High as Funds Pile In 

**US copper futures** have surged to unprecedented levels, with a premium of over $1,000 per tonne compared to the **global benchmark** set in London. This extraordinary price movement is attributed to a combination of speculative fund investments and short-covering by traders, resulting in a significant gap between US and UK copper prices, the likes of which has never been seen before. The rally in copper prices reflects a broader trend of increasing **commodity prices** and their growing appeal as an **inflation hedge** for asset managers and hedge funds. 

The situation has been further exacerbated by concerns over available stock and the potential for a short squeeze, similar to what occurred in the **nickel market** in March 2022. With a ban on Russian copper and logistical challenges impacting US imports, the market is facing a potential supply crunch. This has led to a scramble by commodity traders to secure copper and close out their short positions. The dynamics of the market and the potential for extreme price moves have attracted the attention of speculators, who are contributing to the volatility. 

Additionally, the proposed takeover of Anglo American by BHP, a significant miner of copper, and news of potential Chinese stimulus measures have further fueled the buying frenzy. Analysts attribute the spike in US copper prices to the influx of US-based money into commodities, highlighting the market's disconnect and the influence of fund buying. The situation is indicative of the broader volatility in commodities trading, where traders bear a significant portion of the overall costs, and supply disruptions can have outsized impacts on prices.
