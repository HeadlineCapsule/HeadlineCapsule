# 疫情期间表现强劲的公司市值蒸发 1.5 万亿美元

在 **新冠疫情** 期间股价上涨幅度最大的前 50 大企业实体中，有近 **三分之二** 出现了显著下滑，自 2020 年末以来，这些企业的总市值减少了约 **1.5 万亿美元**。这种变化反映了投资者偏好的转变，因为最初由封锁和疫情限制推动的趋势已经不复存在。

这 50 家公司中大多数是 **科技公司**，每家公司的市值在 2020 年都超过了 **100 亿美元**，并且取得了显著增长。然而，截至 2020 年末，这些早期的赢家们已经集体损失了超过三分之一的市值。其中，**Zoom** 在远程办公采用高峰期股价飙升高达 **765%**，但随后下跌了约 **80%**，市值损失超过 **770 亿美元**。同样，在远程办公热潮中蓬勃发展的 **RingCentral** 也由于科技巨头的竞争而损失了近 **90%** 的市值。

其他值得注意的失败者包括健身自行车制造商 **Peloton**，其股价自 2020 年末以来暴跌超过 **97%**，市值损失约 **430 亿美元**。Peloton 最近宣布了裁员和领导层变动等削减成本的措施。

这些公司的市值下降可以归因于疫情加速趋势的不可持续性，例如 **视频会议** 和 **在线购物**，因为员工们重返办公室，高利率和高生活成本影响了电子商务需求。

尽管总体损失巨大，但仍有一些公司逆势而上。电动汽车制造商 **特斯拉** 在 2020 年的市值飙升了 **787%**，尽管随后有所下滑，但仍然保持着较高的估值。新加坡互联网公司 **Sea** 在疫情期间核心业务蓬勃发展，但由于对增长放缓的担忧，其市值也损失了超过 **60%**。

一些在在线消费热潮中最初发展良好的电子商务公司，如 **Shopify**、**京东** 和 **Chewy**，也遭受了重大损失。而从事疫苗研发的 **制药公司**，例如 **Moderna** 和 **辉瑞**，在 2020 年由于疫苗带来的希望和医疗治疗需求的增加而股价上涨。然而，随着疫苗接种需求变得难以预测，许多疫苗制造商的收益也随之蒸发。

2020 年市值增长前 50 大公司中，只有 7 家保持了增长势头，包括 **中国汽车制造商比亚迪**、**CrowdStrike**、**The Trade Desk**、**Datadog**、**T-Mobile**、**宁德时代** 和 **Mercado Libre**。

另一方面，一些在疫情期间收益增长的公司继续蓬勃发展，包括科技巨头 **英伟达** 和 **亚马逊**，它们在人工智能热潮的推动下，市值大幅增长。

# Pandemic-era winners suffer $1.5tn fall in market value

The top 50 corporate entities that experienced the **biggest stock gains** during the **COVID-19 pandemic** have witnessed a significant decline, losing approximately **$1.5 trillion** in **market capitalization** since the end of **2020**. This shift reflects investors' changing preferences as the initial trends driven by lockdowns and pandemic restrictions fade. 

**Technology companies** dominated the list of these 50 firms, each with a market value exceeding **$10 billion** and remarkable gains in **2020**. However, as of the end of **2020**, these early winners have collectively lost over a third of their market value. Notable examples include **Zoom**, which saw its stock soar by up to **765%** during the peak of remote work adoption, only to fall by about **80%** since then, resulting in a loss of over **$77 billion** in market cap. Similarly, **RingCentral**, which also thrived during the remote work boom, has shed approximately **90%** of its value due to competition from tech giants. 

Other notable losers include **Peloton**, the exercise bike manufacturer, whose shares have plummeted by more than **97%** since the end of **2020**, resulting in a loss of about **$43 billion** in market value. Peloton has recently announced cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and a change in leadership. 

The decline in market value for these companies can be attributed to the less durable nature of pandemic-accelerated trends, such as **videoconferencing** and **online shopping**, as employees return to the office and high-interest rates and living costs impact e-commerce demand. 

Despite the overall losses, a few companies have managed to buck the trend. **Tesla**, the electric car maker, experienced a **787%** jump in market value in **2020**, and while it has since slipped, it still maintains a substantial valuation. **Sea**, a Singapore-based internet company, witnessed a surge across its core businesses during the pandemic but has since lost over **60%** of its value due to growth slowdown fears. 

E-commerce companies like **Shopify**, **JD.com**, and **Chewy**, which initially thrived during the online spending boom, have also incurred substantial losses. Meanwhile, **pharmaceutical companies** involved in vaccine development, such as **Moderna** and **Pfizer**, saw gains in **2020** due to vaccine hopes and increased demand for medical treatments. However, many vaccine makers have since seen their gains erased as demand for shots becomes less predictable. 

Out of the top 50 corporate winners of **2020**, only seven have managed to gain market value, including **Chinese carmaker BYD**, **CrowdStrike**, **The Trade Desk**, **Datadog**, **T-Mobile**, **CATL**, and **Mercado Libre**. 

On the other hand, some companies that made gains during the pandemic have continued to thrive, including tech giants **Nvidia** and **Amazon**, which have added significantly to their market capitalization, particularly driven by the boom in **artificial intelligence**.
