英伟达超越苹果和微软成为全球市值最高的公司

# NVIDIA 超越苹果和微软成为全球市值最高的公司

由于芯片需求强劲以及投资者对人工智能（AI）的兴奋，NVIDIA 的股价增长强劲，使其成为全球**市值最高的上市公司**，超过了苹果和微软。截至周二，这家美国芯片制造商的市值达到 3.335 万亿美元，股价上涨 3.5% 至 135.58 美元。

该公司受益于对训练和运行强大的生成式 AI 模型（例如 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT）的需求增长。在不到两年的时间里，NVIDIA 从一家市值 3000 亿美元的公司转变成为世界上最强大的科技公司之一，而加密货币的崩溃则加剧了芯片过剩问题。

NVIDIA 的股价上涨约占标普 500 指数今年以来 14% 的涨幅的三分之一，其股价自年初以来上涨了约 170%。该公司连续多个季度实现了巨大的收入增长，现在正处于 NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang 所称的“工业革命”的核心，释放生成式 AI 的力量来智能计算，从而改变全球经济的各个部门。

NVIDIA 在市场上的主导地位得到了其软件生态系统 CUDA 的巩固，该生态系统为使用其芯片的开发人员提供工具。竞争对手 AMD 和英特尔已经推出了竞争对手 AI 芯片，但尚未真正侵蚀 NVIDIA 巨大的市场份额。

科技行业正在争相抓住生成式 AI 的机遇，苹果也在上周的年度开发者大会上宣布了自己的生成式模型套件，并与 OpenAI 签署了重大合作伙伴关系协议。

尽管人们担心 NVIDIA 对更广泛的股票指数的影响可能会导致市场长期可持续性问题，但很少有分析师或投资者预测短期内会出现逆转。在 Bloomberg 追踪的 NVIDIA 分析师中，只有一个将该股票评为“卖”。

NVIDIA 是自 1926 年以来第 12 家领导标普 500 指数的公司，在过去十多年里，它一直与美国——甚至是全球——市值最高的公司苹果和微软争夺第一的位置。上一家美国公司比这两者都更有价值是在 2011 年，当时埃克森美孚持有该头衔。

 # Nvidia Surpasses Apple and Microsoft as World's Most Valuable Company

Nvidia has become the world's **most valuable publicly listed company** after surpassing both Apple and Microsoft, thanks to its explosive share price growth driven by demand for chips and investor excitement over artificial intelligence (AI). The US chipmaker's market capitalization reached $3.335tn as of Tuesday, with shares climbing 3.5% to $135.58.

The company has benefited from a boom in demand for chips that can train and run powerful generative AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. In less than two years, Nvidia transformed from a $300bn company grappling with a chip glut exacerbated by a cryptocurrency bust into one of the most powerful tech companies in the world.

Nvidia's huge share price gains have driven about a third of the 14% year-to-date increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index, with its shares up roughly 170% since the start of the year. The company has seen successive quarters of huge revenue growth and is now at the center of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls a new "industrial revolution," unleashing the power of generative AI to transform all sectors of the global economy with intelligent computing.

Nvidia's dominance in the market has been cemented by its software ecosystem, Cuda, which offers tools for developers using its chips. Competitors such as AMD and Intel have launched competing AI chips but have yet to meaningfully eat into Nvidia's commanding market share.

The race to capitalize on the opportunity from generative AI has swept across the tech sector, with Apple joining in by announcing its own suite of generative models and signing a major partnership deal with OpenAI at its annual developers conference last week.

Despite concerns about the long-term sustainability of the market rally due to Nvidia's growing sway over broader stock indices, few analysts or investors are predicting a reversal in the short term. Of the eb Bloomberg tracked Nvidia analysts, just one rated the stock as a "sell."

Nvidia is only the 12th company ever to lead the S&P 500 since its inception in 1926 and has surpassed both Apple and Microsoft after vying for the position of most valuable company in the US—and often the world—for more than a decade. The last time a US company was worth more than both of them was in 2011, when ExxonMobil held that title.
