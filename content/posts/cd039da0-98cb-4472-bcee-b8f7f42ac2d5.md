# 激进投资者在婴儿配方奶粉判决后持股**利洁时** 

一家名为**傲雷资本管理公司**的激进投资者公司在**利洁时**（Reckitt Benckiser）遭美国陪审团裁决其生产的**婴儿配方奶粉**导致一名婴儿死亡并需支付巨额赔偿金之后，收购了这家知名消费品制造商的股份。该事件的赔偿金额达6000万美元，消息一出，利洁时的股价暴跌至历史低位，傲雷资本抓住时机进行了投资。这次诉讼预计将带来高达80亿美元的损失，让外界对其婴儿配方奶粉业务的前景充满不确定性。

资产管理规模约67亿美元的傲雷资本入股加剧了利洁时CEO拉尔斯·范哈伦领导的管理层所面临的压力。股东们呼吁采取果断行动，包括可能出售陷入困境的**婴儿配方奶粉业务**。自2017年以170亿美元收购这部分业务以来，该业务一直被视为一次代价高昂的失误。尽管傲雷资本没有直接对利洁时的领导层变动发表评论，但他们认为有提升运营利润率的空间，并且已经成功影响了Entain等其他目标公司的管理层变动。

由于此次事件和该公司中东业务出现会计异常问题，今年利洁时的股价下跌约15%。随着市场价值降至约405亿英镑，任何重大战略或架构上的变化都将对投资者和消费者产生深远影响。

# Activist investor builds stake in **Reckitt** after baby formula verdict 

**Eminence Capital**, an activist investment firm, has acquired a stake in Reckitt, the manufacturer of well-known consumer brands such as Dettol and Nurofen. This move comes amidst mounting pressure on Reckitt following a damaging US jury ruling linking its **baby formula** to the death of an infant. Eminence began buying shares in March when news of the $60 million damages award caused Reckitt's stock price to plunge towards historic lows, presenting a strategic investment opportunity for activists. The total liability from the formula litigation is estimated at up to £8bn, creating significant uncertainty around **Reckitt's** future and its baby formula division specifically. 

The presence of Eminence, with approximately $6.7 billion in assets under management, adds further pressure on Reckitt's management led by CEO Kris Licht. Shareholders are calling for decisive action, including a potential sale of the beleaguered **baby formula business**, which has been viewed as a costly misstep since its acquisition in 2017 for $17bn. While Eminence hasn't commented directly on leadership changes at Reckitt, they believe there is room for improvement in operating margins and have successfully influenced management shifts at other targeted companies such as Entain. 

Reckitt's shares are down about 15% this year due to the baby formula litigation and an accounting anomaly affecting its Middle East business. With a market value of around £40.5 billion, any significant changes in Reckitt's strategy or structure will have wide-ranging implications for investors and consumers alike.
