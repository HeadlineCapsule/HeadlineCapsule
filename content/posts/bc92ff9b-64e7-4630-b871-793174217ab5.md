华尔街大快朵颐无穷尽的意面和无限量的虾子

# 私人股权投资公司大量投资监狱引发争议，特别聚焦了 CoreCivic（前身是美国惩教公司）的例子。

文章强调，这些投资的驱动力是政府运营惩教设施合同所带来的**高回报和稳定的现金流**。

文章还提到像黑石集团这样的私人股权投资公司收购了 CoreCivic 这类监狱运营商的股份。这些公司经常使用财务工程技术来最大化自身的回报，例如利用杠杆平衡表和分离房地产资产与运营公司（OpCo-PropCo），而这可能会增加其他利益相关者的风险。

文章进一步讨论了对监狱投资的争议，特别是考虑到大规模监禁和从监狱系统盈利的道德问题时。文章以 Red Lobster 的破产申请为例，说明了私人股权投资公司如何激进地获取利润，却留下脆弱的不堪重负。

总之，这篇文章突出了私人股本在监狱投资和其他具有稳定政府合同的行业中的重要作用，引发了对这些行业中道德和风险管理问题的质疑。

The article discusses how private equity firms have invested heavily in prisons, with a focus on CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America) as an example. It highlights that these investments are driven by the potential for high returns and stable cash flows from government contracts to operate correctional facilities.

The article also touchebts how private equity firms, such as The Blackstone Group, have acquired stakes in prison operators like CoreCivic. These firms often use financial engineering techniques, such as leveraging balance sheets and separating real estate assets from operating companies (opco-propco), to maximize returns for themselves while potentially increasing risk for other stakeholders.

The article further discusses the controversy surrounding these investments in prisons, particularly given concerns about mass incarceration and the ethics of profiting from the prison system. The bankruptcy filing by Red Lobster is used as an example to illustrate how private equity firms can aggressively take profits while leaving others vulnerable.

In summary, the article highlights the significant role that private equity plays in investments related to prisons and other sectors with stable government contracts, raising questions about ethics and risk management within these industries.
