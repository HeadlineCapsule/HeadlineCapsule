游戏驿站股票因股份出售计划和“咆哮小猫”直播而下跌

**GameStop 股价下跌，同时Roaring Kitty进行直播**

视频游戏零售商GameStop周五股价大幅下跌，因为宣布了一项新的股票出售计划。这发生在“模因股票”交易员**Roaring Kitty**（真名Keith Gill）试图支持该公司股票的价格波动之际。

尽管Roaring Kitty试图通过YouTube直播提振投资者信心，并曾在今年早些时候推动股价上涨，但GameStop的股价周五仍下跌了近40%。在直播中，Gill表达了对GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen的支持，并强调零售交易员应该关注他。

该公司一直利用其零售投资者的受欢迎程度，通过多次股票销售来加强其财务地位。周五上午，该公司披露了计划与第一季度财务业绩提前发布一起出售7500万股股票。这些结果显示销售额同比下降29%，但净亏损从5050万美元降至3230万美元。

GameStop的核心业务，包括出售游戏机、软件和收藏品，多年来一直在下降。该公司在美国的零售业务在过去五年里缩减了超过四分之一，只剩下4000多间店铺。然而，投资收益帮助减轻了零售业务最近亏损的影响。

上个月，GameStop通过出售4500万新股筹集了9.33亿美元，因为Gill的回归引发了股价的急剧上涨。该公司在这一资金流入之前报告有9.99亿美元的现金储备，债务极少。如果以周五的价格出售新宣布的股票，GameStop可以再筹集21亿美元。

本周早些时候，截屏显示Gill持有GameStop股票和价值高达5.57亿美元的看涨期权，从而引发了猜测。然而，他在周五的直播中否认有任何第三方支持或除了GameStop之外的其他投资。尽管最近股价下跌，但GameStop的股价自Gill在中旬回归以来仍上涨了约60%。

总之，尽管Roaring Kitty试图为GameStop及其股票出售计划鼓舞士气，但该公司由于核心业务下降和越来越依赖投资来抵消零售业务亏损而面临挑战。

 **GameStop Stock Drops Amid Share Sale Plan and Roaring Kitty Livestream**

The video game retailer, GameStop, experienced a significant drop in its stock value on Friday due to the announcement of a new share sale plan. This comes amidst renewed price swings and efforts by "meme stock" trader **Roaring Kitty** (real name Keith Gill) to support the company's shares.

GameStop's shares plunged almost 40% on Friday, despite Roaring Kitty's attempts to rally investor confidence through a YouTube livestream and his previous involvement in boosting the stock earlier this year. In the stream, Gill expressed support for GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen and emphasized that retail traders should focus on him.

The company has been capitalizing on its popularity with retail investors by conducting repeated stock sales to strengthen its financial position. On Friday morning, it disclosed plans to sell another 75 million shares alongside the early release of first-quarter financial results. These results showed a 29% year-on-year drop in sales but also revealed a narrowing net loss from $50.5 million to $amo32.3 million.

GameStop's core business, which includes selling game consoles, software, and collectibles, has been declining over the years. The company's retail footprint in the US has shrunk by more than a quarter in the past five years, leaving just over 4,000 stores. However, gains from investments have helped mitigate losses from its struggling retail operations recently.

Last month, GameStop raised $933 million through the sale of 45 million new shares after Gill's return sparked a sharp increase in stock value. The company reported cash reserves of $999 million before this influx and has minimal debt. If it were to sell the newly announced shares at Friday's price, GameStop could raise an additional $2.1 billion.

Speculation arose earlier this week when screenshots showed Gill holding a position in GameStop stock and call options worth as much as $557 million. However, during his livestream on Friday, he denied having any third-party support or other investments besides GameStop. Despite the recent decline, GameStop's shares remain up about 60% since Gill's return in mid-May.

In conclusion, despite Roaring Kitty's efforts to rally support for GameStop and its stock sale plans, the company continues to face challenges due to a declining core business and an increasing reliance on investments to offset losses from retail operations.
