# 三名男子因涉嫌协助香港情报机构在英国法院受审

三名男子在英国被指控犯有 **间谍** 罪行，包括 **协助外国情报机构** 和 **外国干涉**。这是英国第二次引用《**国家安全法**》，表明了该国近期对反间谍活动的重视。被指控人 Chi Leung Wai、Matthew Trickett 和 Chung Biu Yuen 是 **伦敦警察局反恐部门** 领导的一项更广泛调查中被捕的 11 人之一。虽然尚未披露具体指控和证据细节，但当局强调，他们认为这不会对公众造成更广泛的威胁。英国当局近期开展了多项反间谍行动，针对涉嫌涉及 **中国** 和 **俄罗斯** 的事件，而此次案件是其中之一。

英国近几个月来发生了多起与间谍活动有关的逮捕和指控，有个人被控向外国势力泄露机密和从事破坏活动。新的《国家安全法》在扩大间谍行为定义范围方面发挥了关键作用，导致了最近的指控，并突显出政府对打击外国干涉的承诺。这起三名男子涉嫌与香港情报机构有联系的案件，凸显了现代间谍活动在全球范围内的复杂性，并对国际关系和国家安全产生了潜在影响。

# Three men in UK court accused of assisting Hong Kong intelligence service 

Three men have been charged in the UK with **espionage** offences, including **assisting a foreign intelligence service** and **foreign interference**. This marks the second time the UK's **National Security Act** has been invoked, highlighting a recent focus on countering espionage activities. The accused, Chi Leung Wai, Matthew Trickett, and Chung Biu Yuen, were arrested as part of a broader investigation led by the **Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism division**, which resulted in 11 detentions. While details of the specific charges and evidence have not yet been disclosed, the authorities have emphasized that they do not believe there is a wider threat to the public. This case is one of several recent counter-espionage efforts by UK authorities, targeting alleged incidents involving both **China** and **Russia**.

The UK has seen a string of espionage-related arrests and charges in recent months, with individuals accused of leaking secrets to foreign powers and committing acts of sabotage. The new **National Security Act** has played a pivotal role in broadening the scope of what constitutes spying, leading to these recent charges and highlighting the government's commitment to countering foreign interference. This particular case involving the three men and their alleged ties to Hong Kong's intelligence service underscores the complexity and global nature of modern espionage, with potential implications for international relations and national security.
