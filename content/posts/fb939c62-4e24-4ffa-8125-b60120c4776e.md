苹果将与欧盟解决“轻触支付”调查问题

# 苹果同意解决欧盟的“轻触支付”调查，避免了反垄断罚款。

**苹果** 同意解决欧盟对该公司移动支付系统的调查，向竞争对手开放其系统，从而避免了可能的反垄断罚款。欧洲委员会指控苹果违反了竞争法，称其阻止竞争对手访问 **近场通信（NFC）** 技术，以有利于自己的 **Apple Pay** 系统。

作为回应，苹果在今年1月承诺做出一系列让步，包括为开发人员提供免费访问iOS设备上的NFC技术的机会，而无需使用Apple Pay或Apple Wallet。这些措施将保持十年不变，目前正在由布鲁塞尔官员进行测试。

预计在未来几周内达成和解协议，因为苹果正在最终确定技术细节。然而，其承诺和和解时间可能仍然存在问题。如果成功，这项交易将帮助确保苹果避免受到制裁，例如根据公司全球年度总收入的10%来计算，可能高达400亿美元的罚款，该罚款是基于2023年的收入计算得出的。

Apple Pay被数百亿部iPhone使用，这次和解正值苹果与监管机构关系紧张之际，包括最近因音乐流媒体服务的反竞争行为而被罚18亿欧元，以及根据《数字市场法案》可能受到指控，该法案旨在促进欧洲数字市场的竞争。

 **Apple** agrees to settle EU's 'tap-and-go' payments probe by opening its mobile payment system to rivals and avoiding antitrust fines from the bloc. The European Commission charged Apple with breaking competition law, arguing that it was preventing competitors from accessing **near-field communication (NFC)** technology to benefit its own **Apple Pay** system.

In response, Apple has committed to a series of concessions in January this year, which include providing developers with free access to NFC technology on iOS devices without having to use Apple Pay or Apple Wallet. These measures will be kept in place for a decade and are currently being tested by Brussels officials.

A settlement is likely within the next few weeks as Apple finalizes technical details, although there may still be issues with its commitments and timing of the settlement. If successful, this deal would help ensure that Apple avoids sanctions such as a fine of up to 10% of the company'amoons total worldwide annual turnover, which could amount to approximately $40 billion based on revenues from 2023.

Apple Pay is used by hundreds of millions of iPhones and this settlement comes at a time when Apple has strained relationships with regulators, including a recent €1.8bn fine over anti-competitive practices related to music streaming services and potential charges under the Digital Markets Act designed to enable competition in digital markets within Europe.
