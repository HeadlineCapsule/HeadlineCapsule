影响投资与ESG：哪个产生更好的结果？

# 摘要：
这篇文章讨论了人们越来越多地关注影响投资，这种投资方式不仅追求财务回报，也注重积极的社会和环境影响。影响投资者越来越关注风险投资和私募股权基金，这些基金的目标行业包括清洁能源、可持续产品和服务、信息技术以及医疗保健。联合国可持续发展目标为许多影响投资提供了框架。

值得注意的是，文章举例介绍了Apeel Sciences等公司成功的影响投资案例，该公司通过其可食用的植物涂层产品减少了食物浪费。影响投资者还正在进入非洲等新兴市场，以解决重大挑战并创造增长机会。DBL Partners、TPG Rise Climate Fund和Vital Capital Fund等公司管理的资产不断增加，基金关闭，证明了这些基金的成功。

相比之下，在2021年投资激增之后，ESG（环境、社会和治理）股本基金在2024年经历了资金外流。批评者认为，这些基金没有产生优于平均水平的回报，也没有为可持续发展目标做出重大贡献。

## 问题：

1. 影响投资者瞄准哪些关键行业，Apeel Sciences如何成为成功的影响投资案例？
2. 根据Vital Capital Fund的Nimrod Gerber的说法，非洲如何成为影响投资者的有前景市场？
3. 为什么ESG股本基金在2021年投资激增之后，在2024年经历了资金外流，这对它们挑战可持续发展目标的有效性有何暗示？

**Summary:**
The article discusses the growing interest in impact investing, which aims for both financial returns and positive social/environmental outcomes. Impact investors are increasingly focusing on venture capital and private equity funds that target sectors such as clean energy, sustainable products and services, information technology, and healthcare. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals serve as a framework for many impact investments.

Notably, the article highlights successful examples of impact investing in companies like Apeel Sciences, which reduces food waste through its edible plant coating product. Impact investors are also tapping into emerging markets such as Africa to address significant challenges and create opportunities for growth. The success of these funds is evident from the increasing assets under management and fund closures by firms like DBL Partners, TPG Rise Climate Fund, and Vital Capital Fund.

In contrast, ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) equity funds have experienced outflows in 2024 after a surge of investments in 2021. Critics argue that these funds do not generate superior returns or contribute significantly to the Sustainable Development Goals.

**Questions:**

1. What are some key sectors targeted by impact investors, and how does Apeel Sciences exemplify successful impact investing?
2. How is Africa emerging as a promising market for impact investors, according to Nimrod Gerber of Vital Capital Fund?
3. Why have ESG equity funds experienced outflows in 2024 despite the surge in investments in 2021, and what does this suggest about their effectiveness in achebenging Sustainable Development Goals?
