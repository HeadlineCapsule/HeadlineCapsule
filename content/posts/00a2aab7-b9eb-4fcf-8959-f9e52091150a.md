## **斯洛伐克总理菲乔遇刺后情况严重但稳定**

**斯洛伐克总理罗伯特·菲乔**在周三遭遇**暗杀**未遂后，接受了第二次手术，目前情况**严重但稳定**。菲乔在汉德洛瓦市会见支持者时，被近距离**连开数枪**，此次袭击是**20多年来欧盟国家首位现任领导人遭遇暗杀**，令斯洛伐克和欧盟震惊，也为下月即将举行的**欧洲议会选举蒙上阴影**。

这名**71岁的嫌疑人**已被逮捕，并被指控犯有**出于政治动机的谋杀未遂罪**。菲乔的**外科医生和医疗团队**对其康复持谨慎乐观态度，但全面评估其病情还需数日。这起事件加剧了斯洛伐克**政治紧张局势**，一些人将袭击归咎于该国**恶毒的政治环境**。

作为执政联盟伙伴的**极端民族主义SNS党领袖安德烈·丹科**誓言要与自由派反对派发动"**政治战争**"。同时，菲乔的**亲密盟友**之一**罗伯特·卡利纳克**预计将担任代理总理。卡利纳克呼吁保持冷静，并要求停止政治攻击的恶性循环。然而，由于暂时失去了菲乔这位**足智多谋的政治领袖**，外交官们担心**执政联盟的脆弱性**，以及局势可能会失控。

# Slovak PM Awake But in Serious Condition After Shooting

**Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico** is in a **serious but stable condition** after undergoing a **second surgery** following an **assassination attempt** on Wednesday. Fico was **shot multiple times at close range** while meeting supporters in the city of Handlová. The shooting, the **first such attack on a sitting leader of an EU country in over 20 years**, has shocked Slovakia and the EU ahead of the **European Parliament elections next month**. 

The **71-year-old suspect** has been **apprehended and charged with politically motivated attempted murder**. Fico's **surgeons and medical team** are cautiously optimistic about his recovery, but it will take several days to fully assess his condition. The incident has **heightened political tensions** in Slovakia, with some blaming the **toxic political environment** for the attack. 

**Andrej Danko**, leader of the **ultranationalist SNS party**, a coalition partner, has vowed to start a **"political war" with the liberal opposition**. In the meantime, **Robert Kaliňák**, one of Fico's **closest allies**, is expected to take over as interim prime minister. Kaliňák has urged calm and called for an end to the cycle of political attacks. However, with Fico's **slick political skills** temporarily out of the picture, diplomats worry about the **fragility of the ruling coalition** and the potential for the situation to spin out of control.
