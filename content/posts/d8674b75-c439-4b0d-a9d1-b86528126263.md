# **交易员**在通胀数据更新后重新审视利率赌注

**交易员** 和投资者在美国和欧洲最新通胀数据公布后，正在重新评估他们对利率走势的预测。在美国，4 月通胀略有缓和，降至 3.4%，而**核心消费价格**（不包括波动较大的食品和能源成本）上涨了 3.6%。这一出乎意料的通胀放缓趋势导致投资者押注今年晚些时候**美联储可能降息**。然而，**美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔**警告称，通胀可能比预期更顽固，表明利率可能需要在更长时间内保持在高位。

相反，**欧元区通胀** 预计将比最初预期更快下降，**欧洲中央银行**设定的 2% 目标可能会在明年下半年达到。这加剧了人们的预期，即欧洲将比美联储更早降息，尽管**欧洲央行决策者之间存在一些分歧**。这两个地区在货币政策上的分歧值得注意，瑞典最近八年来首次下调利率。

通胀更新发布之际，正值**美国总统乔·拜登** 面临艰难的连任之战。尽管股市强劲可能是一个积极的迹象，但不断上涨的物价仍令美国人感到担忧，根据最近的一项 FT-密歇根罗斯民意调查，80% 的人表示经济状况不佳。

与此同时，英国在就业市场放缓的情况下，仍旧在经历强劲的工资增长，3 月份的三个月内工资增长了 5.7%。

文章还提到了其他全球经济发展动态，包括欧盟更新的增长预测、英美烟草公司潜在的分拆、巴西石油公司（Petrobras）的高层变动，以及通胀对全球政治和经济决策的影响。

# Traders Examine Interest Rate Bets After Inflation Updates

**Traders** and investors are re-evaluating their predictions for interest rate movements in the US and Europe following the latest inflation data. In the US, inflation eased slightly to 3.4% in April, while **core consumer prices** rose by 3.6%, excluding volatile food and energy costs. This break in the streak of higher-than-expected inflation readings led investors to bet on potential **Federal Reserve interest rate cuts** later in the year. However, **Fed Chair Jay Powell** cautioned that inflation could be stickier than expected, indicating that interest rates may need to stay higher for an extended period. 

In contrast, **eurozone inflation** is expected to decline faster than initially thought, with the **European Central Bank's** target of 2% likely to be reached in the second half of next year. This has fueled expectations that Europe will cut rates much earlier than the Fed, despite some **disagreement among ECB policymakers**. The divergence in monetary policies between the two regions is notable, with Sweden recently cutting rates for the first time in eight years. 

The inflation updates come at a critical time for **US President Joe Biden**, who is facing an uphill battle for re-election in November. While a strong stock market may be a positive sign, rising prices continue to cause concern for Americans, with 80% reporting economic pain in a recent FT-Michigan Ross poll. 

Meanwhile, the UK is experiencing strong wage growth of 5.7% in the three months to March, despite a slowing jobs market. 

The article also touches on various other global economic developments, including the EU's updated growth estimates, the potential breakup of Anglo American, leadership changes at Petrobras, and the impact of inflation on political and economic decisions worldwide.
