电报再次被封，RedBird IMI 试图追回其 6 亿英镑投资

**红鸟IMI** 启动第二次拍卖，以回收在《英国电讯报》和《旁观者》杂志上花费的6亿英镑。这个由阿布扎比资金支持的美国投资集团在揭示其出版商账户2.78亿英镑的黑洞后，已向潜在买家发送了交易信息备忘录。

拍卖过程在英国大选前不到两周进行，并继去年的首次销售尝试之后。红鸟IMI寻求在7月底之前获得第一轮竞标，超过20个党派正在接收准备信息。在过去的一年里，这份报纸没有永久主人，在此期间由独立董事管理。

《电讯报》和《旁观者》可以单独出售或作为一揽子组合出售。竞标人预测，《旁观者》的价格较低，将吸引更多的兴趣。红鸟IMI确认销售流程已经开始：“潜在所有者可以从今天开始提交他们的初始出价。”

英国政府此前因担心新闻自由而阻止了一项早期交易，因为阿布扎比为红鸟IMI提供了资金。最新的财务信息显示，由于巴克莱家族取得的贷款，有2.78亿英镑的准备金，这些贷款不太可能得到偿还。尽管如此，在剔除准备金后，基本收益增长了25%以上，达到6000万英镑。

 **RedBird IMI** initiates second auction to recoup £600mn spent on UK's Telegraph newspaper and Spectator magazine. The US investment group, backed by Abu Dhabi money, has sent out the deal information memorandum to prospective buyers after revealing a £278mn black hole in their publisher's accounts.

The auction process comes less than two weeks before the UK general election and follows an initial sales attempt last year. RedBird IMI seeks first-round bids by the end of July, with over 20 parties receiving information for preparation. The newspaper has been without a permanent owner for more than a year, managed by independent directors during this time.

The Telegraph and Spectator are up for sale separately or as a combined package. Bidders predict that the lower-priced Spectator will attract more interest. RedBird IMI confirmed the sales process has started, stating: "Prospective owners can submit their initial bids from today."

The UK government previously blocked an earlier deal due to concerns over press freedamoins given Abu Dhabi funding for RedBird IMI. The latest financial information reveals a £278mn provision owing to loans taken out by the Barclay family, which are unlikely to be repaid. Despite this, underlying earnings rose more than 25% to £60mn after stripping out provisions.
