# 欧洲反补贴新武器威力强大但控制困难

**欧洲委员会**近期启用了一项新的监管武器——**《外国补贴条例》（FSR）**。该条例允许**欧盟**调查和应对外国补贴对**单一市场**造成的扭曲影响，填补了现有**反补贴规则**中的空白。虽然《外国补贴条例》是一种快速而强大的工具，但也是一种锋芒毕露的工具，可能引发与**中国**和**欧盟成员国**的对抗，尤其是在**绿色技术**和**电动汽车 (EV)** 方面。 

**竞争和内部市场事务委员会**被授予了重大权力，包括可以对在**欧盟市场**运营的外资公司发起 "主动调查"，要求提供信息，并可能下令**剥离资产**。这已经导致了一些备受瞩目的调查，例如突袭被指控收集敏感数据的中国公司**Nuctech**，以及对中国风电设备制造商的广泛调查。 

尽管《外国补贴条例》是欧盟大胆的行动，但它并不是实现 "战略自主 "的协调计划。它有可能与成员国利益相冲突，特别是那些寻求廉价绿色技术的国家，还可能阻碍外国投资。在电动汽车行业，冲突的可能性尤其高，因为中国公司已经在加大对欧洲生产设施的投资。作为一项逐个公司适用的工具，《外国补贴条例》缺乏**贸易总署**反补贴调查的精确性，后者会仔细考虑成员国的观点和更广泛的战略关系。

**欧盟竞争事务专员**玛格丽特·维斯塔格承认了《外国补贴条例》的局限性，以及国际间在补贴问题上协调一致的必要性。然而，该条例的快速和强大的特性使其成为一项重要的监管武器，如果使用得当，可以解决欧盟市场中因外国补贴造成的扭曲影响。

# Europe’s new anti-subsidy weapon is powerful but hard to control

The **European Commission** has recently unleashed a new regulatory weapon in its arsenal: the **Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR)**. This regulation allows the **EU** to investigate and counter the effects of foreign subsidies that distort the **single market**, plugging a gap in existing **anti-subsidy rules**. While the FSR is a swift and powerful tool, it is also a blunt one that could provoke confrontations with **China** and **EU member states**, particularly over **green technology** and **electric vehicles (EVs)**. 

/n/n

The FSR gives the **Commission Directorates for Competition and the Internal Market** significant powers, including the ability to launch "own initiative" investigations into foreign-owned companies operating in the **EU market**, demanding information and potentially ordering **divestment**. This has already led to high-profile investigations, such as raids on **Nuctech**, a Chinese company accused of collecting sensitive data, and a broader probe into Chinese wind power equipment manufacturers. 

/n/n

While the FSR is a bold move by the EU, it is not a cohesive plan for achieving "strategic autonomy." It risks clashing with member states' interests, particularly those seeking cheap green technology, and could deter foreign investment. The potential for conflict is especially high in the EV sector, with Chinese companies already investing in production facilities in Europe. The FSR, a company-by-company tool, lacks the precision of the **Trade Directorate's** anti-subsidy investigations, which carefully manage member states' views and consider broader strategic relations. 

/n/n

Margrethe Vestager, the **EU's competition chief**, acknowledges the FSR's limitations and the need for international coordination on subsidies. However, the speed and power of the FSR make it a significant regulatory weapon that, if used carefully, can address distortions caused by foreign subsidies in the EU market.
