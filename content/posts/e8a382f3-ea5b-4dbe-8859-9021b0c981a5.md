百慕大在777事件后整顿关联方投资

百慕大金融监管机构加强对关联方投资的监管

在777事件后，百慕大货币管理局（BMA）正在加强对人寿保险公司和再保险公司的监督。该事件凸显了与关联方投资相关的风险，监管机构确认，将对涉及附属资产的新投资进行事前审批，以防止利益冲突，并确保与负债的适当匹配。

**背景**：
BMA采取行动的是777 Re危机之后，在此次危机中，百慕大一家再保险公司承担了与Josh Wander位于迈阿密的投资公司相关的巨大风险。这引发了对百慕大人寿再保险公司及其监管问题的质疑。该事件还暴露了由私募股权支持的保险集团将长期负债与流动性投资（如由母公司提供的私募贷款）匹配的问题。

**新法规**：
为应对这些担忧，BMA实施了新的法规，要求对涉及关联方的任何新投资进行事前授权。这一变化旨在解决潜在的利益冲突问题，并确保附属投资适合覆盖保单持有人负债。该监管机构还要求提高透明度，说明附属方如何从保险公司的投资中受益。

**影响**：
BMA加强了审查力度，包括报告、现场检查，以及保险公司必须证明其附属投资适当性的更高门槛。该监管机构坚持认为，这些资产可能很复杂，容易发生利益冲突，从而产生额外的风险和治理挑战。

**行业反应**：
保险公司反对由于新规则造成的监管重复和不一致，但仍然致力于在促进金融稳定和保单持有人保护的管辖范围内运营。BMA采取的更严格立场可能会影响未来的跨境交易，尤其是涉及私募贷款投资的资产支持再保险交易。

**结论**：
百慕大货币管理局正在采取果断行动，解决777事件所引发的问题，并在其保险业中加强透明度和问责制。新法规旨在保护保单持有人，促进金融稳定，并防止附属投资中的潜在利益冲突。

 **Bermuda's Financial Watchdog Cracks Down on Connected-Party Investments**

The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) is intensifying its scrutiny of life insurers and reinsurers following the 777 saga, which highlighted issues with investments in connected parties. The regulator has confirmed that it will now require prior approval for new investments involving affiliated assets to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure appropriate matching with liabilities.

**Background:**
The BMA's actions come after the 777 Re crisis, where significant exposure was taken on assets connected to Josh Wander's Miami-based investment firm. This raised questions about life reinsurers in Bermuda and their regulation. The saga also shed light on private equity-backed insurance groups that matched long-term liabilities with illiquid investments, such as private credit sourced by parent companies.

**New Regulations:**
In response to these concerns, the BMA has implemented new regulations requiring pre-authorization for any new investments involving connected parties. This change aims to address potential conflicts of interest and ensure that affiliated investments are suitable for covering policyholder liabilities. The watchdog is also demanding greater transparency on how affiliated parties benefit from insurers' investments.

**Impact:**
The BMA's increased scrutiny has led to reporting, onsite examinations, and a more challenging hurdle for insurers to demonstrate the appropriateness of their affiliated investments. The regulator remains firm in its stance that these assets can be complex and prone to conflicts of interest, creating additional risks and governance challenges.

**Industry Response:**
Insurers have argued against regulatory duplication and incongruity due to the new rules but remain committed to operating within a jurisdiction promoting financial stability and policyholder protection. The BMA's tougher stance may impact future cross-border deals, particularly in asset-backed reinsurance transactions that involve private credit investments.

**Conclusion:**
The Bermuda Monetary Authority is taking decisive action to address concerns raised by the 777 saga and ensure greater transparency and accountability within its insurance industry. The new regulations aim to protect policyholders, promote financial stability, and mitebody against potential conflicts of interest in affiliated investments.
