# 工党质疑为何纳税人要为 HS2 项目提供资金，尽管苏纳克做出承诺

**工党**质疑英国政府决定向**高速铁路 2 号（HS2）**项目拨款**10 亿英镑**用于在伦敦中心区进行隧道工程。此举与**首相里希·苏纳克**先前的承诺相悖，他此前承诺将**尤斯顿连接线**全部**65 亿英镑**成本转移给**私营部门**。这一资金决定引发了人们对透明度和潜在延误的担忧，**反对党**要求澄清资金来源以及对其他基础设施项目可能产生的影响。政府坚持其对私营融资尤斯顿车站的承诺，称私营部门已表现出兴趣，但同时受到批评，因为项目暂停造成了不确定性并可能导致成本上升。 HS2 项目最初设想作为连接英格兰北部和南部的宏大计划，但在苏纳克执政期间已被大幅修改并超出预算，北部路段因预算问题而被取消。

# Labour asks why taxpayers are set to fund HS2 work despite Sunak pledge

The **Labour Party** has questioned the UK government's decision to allocate **£1 billion** of taxpayer money to the **High Speed 2 (HS2)** rail project, specifically for tunneling work under central London. This intervention comes despite **Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's** previous pledge to shift the entire **£6.5 billion** cost of the **Euston link** to the **private sector**. The funding decision raises concerns about transparency and potential delays, with the **opposition** asking for clarity on the source of funds and any potential impact on other infrastructure projects. The government maintains its commitment to a privately financed Euston station, citing private sector interest, but faces criticism for creating uncertainty and potential cost increases through project pauses. The HS2 project, originally conceived as a grand connection between northern and southern England, has already faced significant changes and cost overruns, with the northern leg scrapped by Sunak due to budget concerns.
