西南水务公司所有者因寄生虫爆发事件后宣布派息而受到批评

# **西南水务公司所有者因股息公告面临批评**

## 摘要： 

英国 **Pennon** 集团作为西南水务公司的所有者，在其宣布将向股东派发1.27亿英镑的股息后，遭到议员和公众的强烈批评。就在几天前，德文郡爆发了 **寄生虫疫情** ，有 17000 户家庭被警告不要饮用未煮沸的自来水，因为检测到 **密孢子虫污染** 。该公司最近一直存在环境和健康违规行为，包括去年因其造成的污水污染而被罚款220万英镑。尽管如此，Pennon仍计划将股息提高3.8%，引发了人们的愤怒并呼吁暂停股息分红。

## 问题和解答：

1. **西南水务公司所有者 Pennon 为什么面临批评？**
   - 在其服务地区爆发寄生虫疫情后几天，Pennon宣布向股东派发大笔股息，因此受到强烈谴责。这导致人们指责该公司优先考虑利润而不是公共健康和环境责任，尤其是考虑到该公司最近因类似事件被罚款的情况。

2. **寄生虫疫情的影响是什么？**
   - 密孢子虫的爆发影响了德文郡超过17000户家庭和企业，他们必须先煮沸水才能饮用。到目前为止，已经报告了100多例腹泻和呕吐等不愉快症状，突显出受寄生虫污染的水供应所造成的严重健康风险。

3. **Pennon 对批评有何回应？**
   - Pennon 在回应强烈反对时表示，他们将向受影响的客户提供总计350万英镑（平均每户约215英镑）的赔偿。此外，该公司还指出，由于去年英国环境署的罚款减少了240万英镑，今年其股息增幅实际上低于预期水平。

4. **议员和政府官员对这一情况有何看法？**
   - 保守党托特尼斯选区国会议员安东尼·曼加诺（Anthony Mangnall）呼吁Pennon暂停分红，并表示在公众对西南水务公司表现缺乏信心时，该公司做出这样的决定令人失望。环境大臣史蒂夫·巴克利（Steve Barclay）也同样感到愤怒和沮丧，他要求各公司在保护河流和水道方面作出重大改变。巴克利的盟友进一步批评了Pennon，称鉴于该公司最近因污染违法行为被罚款，其行为是不可接受的。

5. **这一事件对 Pennon 的股价有何影响？**
   - 在宣布派发股息后遭到批评，导致周二Pennon的股票下跌超过5%，反映出投资者对其公司声誉

# **South West Water Owner Faces Criticism Over Dividend Announcement** 

## Summary: 
**Pennon**, owner of South West Water in the UK, has faced intense criticism from MPs and the public after announcing a £127 million dividend payout to shareholders. This decision comes just days after a **parasitic outbreak** in Devon, where 17,000 households were warned against drinking tap water without boiling it first due to **cryptosporidium contamination**. The company has a recent history of environmental and health violations, including a £2.2 million fine for sewage pollution last year. Despite this, Pennon plans to increase its dividend by 3.8%, sparking outrage and calls for the suspension of the dividend offering. 

## Questions & Answers: 

1. **Why is South West Water owner Pennon facing criticism?** 
   - Pennon has come under fire for announcing a substantial dividend payout to shareholders just days after a parasitic outbreak in the region it serves. This has led to accusations of prioritizing profits over public health and environmental responsibilities, especially given the company's recent fines and violations. 

2. **What was the impact of the parasitic outbreak?** 
   - The outbreak of cryptosporidium affected more than 17,000 households and businesses in Devon, requiring them to boil their water before drinking it. Over 100 cases of unpleasant symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting have been reported so far, highlighting a significant health risk posed by the parasite-contaminated water supply. 

3. **How has Pennon responded to the criticism?** 
   - In response to the backlash, Pennon has stated that they will provide compensation of £3.5 million to affected customers, amounting to approximately £215 per household. Additionally, they have pointed out that this year's dividend increase is actually lower than it could have been due to last year's fine from the Environment Agency, reducing it by £2.4 million. 

4. **What are MPs and government officials saying about the situation?** 
   - Anthony Mangnall, Conservative MP for Totnes, has called for Pennon to suspend their dividend offering, expressing disappointment at their decision during a time of low public confidence in South West Water's performance. Steve Barclay, the environment secretary, shares the anger and frustration, demanding a step change from companies to protect rivers and waterways. An ally of Barclay further criticized Pennon, calling their actions unacceptable given their recent fines for pollution offenses. 

5. **How has this incident impacted Pennon's stock price?** 
   - The announcement of the dividend payout and subsequent criticism led to a drop in Pennon's shares by more than 5% during trading on Tuesday, reflecting investor concerns over the company's reputation and potential regulatory action. 

6. **What are water companies projecting for future bill increases?**
   - Water companies in England are requesting significant bill increases over the next five years: Southern Water (91%), Thames Water (59%) and Pennon (33%). These proposed hikes, which include annual inflation, have sparked concerns among consumer groups and will likely cause a shock to customers. 

This incident highlights ongoing tensions between private water companies' financial goals and their responsibilities to the public and environment, with increasing scrutiny on how these companies operate and prioritize investments in infrastructure and improvements.
