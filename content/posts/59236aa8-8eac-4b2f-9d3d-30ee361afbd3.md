# 特朗普媒体审计机构倒闭，IPO 和公司业绩发布推迟

**美国证券交易委员会（SEC）** 关闭了 **BF Borgers**（特朗普前总统社交媒体集团的审计机构）的举动，打乱了多家计划上市公司的计划，并迫使众多上市公司推迟其财务报告。美国证券交易委员会指控 Borgers 及其创始人“大规模欺诈”，声称该公司虚假宣传其审计将遵守美国标准，且 ** 四分之三的审计有缺陷**。在财报季，这在小型股板块引发了震荡，影响了 9 家计划 IPO 的微型股公司，以及约 170 家现在需要寻找新审计机构的上市公司。此次事件产生了巨大影响，人们将其与 20 多年前 **安然（Arthur Andersen）** 的倒闭相提并论。受影响的公司，包括 **Droneify Holdings**、**Micropolis Robotic** 和 **TessPay**，现在必须寻找新的审计机构，其公开发行可能会推迟。此次事件还影响了上市公司，许多公司预计将推迟发布财报。美国证券交易委员会给予了有限延期，但这一广受欢迎的审计机构突发倒闭造成的混乱让许多企业措手不及，凸显了审计生态系统的脆弱性，以及当主要参与者出现问题时可能造成的广泛中断。

# Closure of Trump Media auditor delays IPOs and company results 

**The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)** move to shut down **BF Borgers**, the auditor for **former President Donald Trump's social media group**, has disrupted the plans of several companies aiming to go public and forced numerous listed firms to delay their financial reporting. The SEC charged Borgers and its founder with "massive fraud," alleging that the firm falsely claimed its audits would comply with US standards, and that **three-quarters of its audits were faulty**. This has sent shockwaves through the **small-cap sector** during earnings season, impacting nine microcap companies planning IPOs and around 170 public companies that now need new auditors. The ripple effect has been significant, and the situation has been likened to the collapse of **Arthur Andersen** over 20 years ago. The affected companies, including **Droneify Holdings**, **Micropolis Robotic**, and **TessPay**, must now find new auditors and may face delays in their public offerings. The fallout has also hit listed companies, with many expecting to be late in filing their results. The SEC has offered a limited extension, but the disruption caused by the sudden unavailability of a widely used auditor has caught many businesses off guard, highlighting the fragility of the auditing ecosystem and the potential for widespread disruption when a major player falters.
