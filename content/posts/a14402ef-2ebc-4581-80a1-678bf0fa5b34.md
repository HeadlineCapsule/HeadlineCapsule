## 拜登和特朗普将于六九月展开辩论

**乔·拜登**总统和前总统**唐纳德·特朗普**计划于六九月展开两次辩论，打破传统辩论日程。拜登的竞选主席**詹·奥马利·狄龙**提议了这两次备选辩论，并建议在六月底和九月底举行。辩论将会在电视演播室举行，没有现场观众，这符合拜登竞选团队的偏好，即避免“吵闹或破坏性的党派人士和捐款人”。特朗普表示同意，但他更倾向于有观众的大型场地。拜登竞选团队还提议在七月底举行一场副总统辩论，因为特朗普尚未选择竞选伙伴。这与惯例有所背离，因为过去三十多年来，总统辩论一直由**总统辩论委员会**组织安排。拜登团队在给该委员会的信中批评了其对过去辩论的处理方式以及执行规则不力。

# Joe Biden and Donald Trump Set for Debates in June and September

President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump are set to engage in two debates, organized by news organizations, in June and September, breaking with the traditional debate schedule. Biden's campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, proposed these alternative debates, suggesting late June and September as the dates. The debates would be held in a television studio without a live audience, a format Biden's campaign prefers to avoid "raucous or disruptive partisans and donors." Trump has signaled his agreement, although he prefers a large venue with an audience. The Biden campaign also proposed a vice-presidential debate for late July, as Trump has not yet chosen a running mate. This marks a departure from the usual process, as the **Commission on Presidential Debates** has organized debates for over **three decades**. The campaign's letter to the commission criticized their handling of past debates and their inability to enforce rules.
