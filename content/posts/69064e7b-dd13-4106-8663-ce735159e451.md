# 工党和保守党是否在采纳“希维斯经济学”？

**英国** **影子财政大臣** **瑞秋·里夫斯** （Rachel Reeves） 最近承诺为该国的经济政策带来“稳定”，以区别于保守党内部动荡造成的近期“混乱”。然而，经济学家注意到，工党和现任由 **财政大臣杰里米·亨特** （Jeremy Hunt）领导的保守党政府的经济政策之间正在出现越来越多的契合点。这种综合经济思想被昵称为“ **希维斯经济学** ”（Heevesian economics），反映了他们在财政政策、金融服务改革，甚至某些税收措施方面的做法趋同。

虽然工党批评了保守党最近对经济的处理，但值得注意的是，他们并没有反对 **亨特** **关键经济决策** 的许多方面，包括削减国家保险费率，以及秋季声明和春季预算中宣布的一系列措施。里夫斯还采纳了亨特的财政规则，即减少占国民收入份额的债务，从而限制了她未来政府的支出能力。像 **财政研究所** （Institute for Fiscal Studies） 这样的智库已经认识到这种一致性，其主任 **保罗·约翰逊** （Paul Johnson） 指出了他们在税收措施和财政规则方面的相似性。

与此同时，**亨特** 采用了工党的一些政策，例如对北海石油和天然气生产商征收暴利税，以及修改“非户主”税收特权。保守党将公司税提高到 25% 也符合里夫斯所说的舒适度。尽管有这些相似之处，但随着大选临近，双方都预计会强调他们在重大经济问题上的分歧，淡化一致领域。这包括里夫斯对亨特废除国家保险计划的批评，她认为该计划不负责任且成本高昂；以及亨特坚称只有保守党才能有效管理经济、减税和抵制劳动力市场监管。

# Are Labour and the Conservatives adopting 'Heevesian' economics?

**Rachel Reeves**, the UK's **shadow chancellor**, recently pledged to bring "stability" to the country's economic policies, distancing herself from the recent "chaos" caused by the Conservative Party's internal turmoil. However, economists have noted a growing alignment between the economic policies of the Labour Party and those of the current Conservative government under **Chancellor Jeremy Hunt**. This synthesis has been dubbed "**Heevesian** economics," and it reflects a convergence in their approaches to fiscal policy, financial services reform, and even certain tax measures.

/n/n

While Labour has criticized the Conservatives' recent handling of the economy, they have notably refrained from opposing many of **Hunt's key economic decisions**, including cuts in national insurance rates and a range of measures announced in the Autumn Statement and Spring Budget. Reeves has also embraced Hunt's fiscal rule of reducing debt as a share of national income, limiting her future government's spending power. This alignment has been recognized by think tanks like the **Institute for Fiscal Studies**, whose director, **Paul Johnson**, noted the similarity in their tax measures and fiscal rules.

/n/n

At the same time, **Hunt has adopted some Labour policies**, such as the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers and changes to "non-dom" tax privileges. The Conservatives' increase in **corporation tax** to 25% is also in line with Reeves' stated comfort level. Despite these similarities, both parties are expected to emphasize their differences as the election nears, downplaying the areas of agreement on significant economic issues. This includes Reeves' criticism of Hunt's plan to abolish national insurance, which she argues is irresponsible and costly, and Hunt's insistence that only the Conservatives will effectively manage the economy, cut taxes, and resist labor market regulation.
