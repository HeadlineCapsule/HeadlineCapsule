摩根士丹利跟进高盛，取消英国奖金上限

**摩根大通** 跟随高盛，取消了英国员工的奖金上限，允许他们获得最高可达基本工资 10 倍的奖金。这一决定是英国去年 10 月选择取消对顶尖绩优员工奖金支付限额后的结果。

这家华尔街银行旨在制定出行业中最有吸引力和最平衡的薪酬结构，固定薪酬保持竞争力，同时为适当奖励高绩效员工留出充足空间。摩根大通的计划侧重于抵押贷款等常规支出的稳定性，预计今年年度薪酬水平不会显著变化。

一些人对取消奖金上限的决定持争议态度，认为这将导致薪酬不必要地膨胀，因为银行已经采取措施弥补了现有结构中的不足。然而，大型贷款机构认为这使他们能够与其他市场（例如纽约）的薪酬包保持一致。

其他银行预计将跟随高盛和摩根大通的脚步取消上限，以免人才流失。与此同时，欧洲一些最大的银行已呼吁欧盟考虑取消上限，以便他们不会在招聘方面比英国和美国市场处于劣势。

 **JPMorgan Chase** follows Goldman Sachs in lifting bonus caps for its employees in the United Kingdom, allowing them to earn up to 10 times their base salary as bonuses. This decision comes after Britain's choice to remove limits on payouts to top performers last October.

The Wall Street bank aims to develop one of the most attractive and balanced pay structures in the industry, with fixed pay remaining competitive while providing ample room for rewarding high-performing employees appropriately. JPMorgan's plan focuses on stability for regular expenses like mortgages and does not expect annual pay levels to significantly change from this year.

The removal of bonus caps is seen as controversial by some, who argue that it will unnecessarily inflate pay since banks have already taken steps to compensate for the existing structure. However, large lenders believe it allows them to keep up with pay packages in other markets such as New York.

Other banks are expected to follow Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan's lead in lifting the cap to avoid losing talent. Meanwhile, some of Europe's largest banks have called on the bloc to consider removing the cap so they do not face a hiring disadvantage compared to the UK and US markets.
