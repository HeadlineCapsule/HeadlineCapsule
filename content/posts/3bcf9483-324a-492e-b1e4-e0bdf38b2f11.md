马克·鲁特为担任北约最高职务清除最后一道障碍

马克·鲁特（Mark Rutte）在被任命为北约下任秘书长的任命中，清除了最后的障碍，因为他的唯一竞争对手于周四退出竞选。这位荷兰首相将于10月上任，接替自2014年以来领导美国领导的军事联盟的挪威前首相延斯·斯托尔滕贝格（Jens Stoltenberg），后者任期已延长四次。

在俄罗斯对乌克兰发动战争之际，鲁特得到了美国的早期支持，美国向其他北约成员国施压，以在下个月华盛顿举行的北约峰会之前达成协议。这位荷兰政治家赢得了联盟32个成员的一致支持，因为罗马尼亚总统克劳斯·约翰尼斯（Klaus Iohannis）退出了竞选，使鲁特成为该职位唯一的候选人。

预计北约大使将在下周的一次非正式会议上正式批准这一任命，这次会议被称为“院长咖啡会”，届时将确认对鲁特10月上任的共识。这位自2010年以来一直领导荷兰的总理因其在欧盟内部的联盟建设技能和影响力而受到广泛尊重。

鲁特还在唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统任期内获得了认可，因为他与这位前美国总统建立了良好关系，并缓和了特朗普关于欧洲防务开支的一些激进言论。这一特质有助于确保对鲁特候选资格的支持，尤其是当11月美国总统选举临近之际。

在准备担任北约领导职务时，马克·鲁特目前在荷兰领导一个看守政府，此前他在7月最后一次联盟崩溃后上任。他很可能会在下个月被迪克·斯库夫（Dick Schoof）取代，后者是荷兰情报部门的前负责人，将领导一个包括极右翼自由党在内的政府。

 **Mark Rutte** has cleared the final hurdle for his appointment as the next secretary-general of NATO after his only rival withdrew from the race on Thursday. The Dutch prime minister is set to take office in October, succeeding Norway's former Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg who led the US-led military alliance since cuyrucayn 2014 and had his term extended four times.

Rutte secured early backing from the United States, which exerted pressure on other NATO members to clinch a deal before the upcoming Nato summit in Washington next month amidst Russia's war against Ukraine. The Dutch politician managed to win unanimous support of the alliance’s 32 members after Romanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew his candidacy, leaving Rutte as the sole candidate for the position.

The formal approval by NATO ambassadors is expected next week during an informal gathering known as the "dean's coffee," where consensus will be confirmed for Rutte to take office in October. The Dutch prime minister, who has been leading his country since 2010, is widely respected for his coalition-building skills and influence within the European Union.

Rutte also gained recognition during Donald Trump's presidency for building a rapport with the former US president and mollifying some of his aggressive outbursts about European defense spending. This attribute played a role in securing support for Rutte's candidacy, especially as the US presidential election approaches in November.

As he prepares to assume the NATO leadership position, Mark Rutte currently heads a caretaker government in the Netherlands following his last coalition collapse in July. He is likely to be replaced next month by Dick Schoof, a former head of Dutch intelligence services, who will lead a government that includes the far-right Freedom party.
