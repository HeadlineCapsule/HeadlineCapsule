# 奶牛骗局？美国商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）介入调查高达1.91亿美元的Cowzi骗局

**美国商品期货交易委员会（ CFTC ）** 近日对一家名为 Agridime 的公司提起诉讼，该公司涉嫌经营一项欺诈性的奶牛投资计划。总部位于德克萨斯州沃思堡的 Agridime 向投资者承诺高额的保障回报，提出由公司负责奶牛的日常喂养和饲养，而投资者则从牛肉销售中获利。

**CFTC** 指控 Agridime 没有购买足够数量的奶牛来履行其义务，导致经营成了**庞氏骗局**。新投资者的资金被用于支付早期投资者的回报。诉讼还指控 Agridime 谎报资金用途，数百万资金被挪用为公司人员的隐性佣金。

此前，**美国证券交易委员会（ SEC ）** 于 12 月采取行动，获得一项临时限制令、资产冻结，并指定了一名接收人。**SEC** 估计，Agridime 从 2,100 多名投资者手中筹集了至少 1.91 亿美元，承诺最高 32% 的回报。

**CFTC** 的投诉强调，Agridime 在 2021 年至 2023 年期间通过其在线牛平台收到了超过 1.61 亿美元的资金，而该公司关于牛的数量和位置的记录却稀缺且不准确。Agridime 的全面清算计划预计将在 7 月底前出台。

# Dairy me, now the CFTC wants a piece of the $191mn Cowzi scheme 

**The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** has filed a complaint against Agridime, a company that allegedly operated a fraudulent cattle investment scheme. Agridime, based in Fort Worth, pitched investors with the prospect of guaranteed high returns, offering to handle the day-to-day care of cattle, including feeding and raising, while investors profited from the sale of beef. 

The **CFTC** alleges that Agridime failed to purchase the number of cattle required to fulfill its obligations, resulting in a **Ponzi scheme** where new investors' funds were used to pay returns to earlier investors. The complaint also alleges that Agridime misrepresented how investors' funds would be used, with millions being diverted as undisclosed commissions to company personnel. 

This case follows a previous action by the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** in December, which obtained a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and the appointment of a receiver. The **SEC** estimated that Agridime had raised at least $191 million from over 2,100 investors, promising returns of up to 32%. 

The CFTC's complaint highlights that Agridime received over $161 million between 2021 and 2023 on its online cattle platform, with the company's records on cattle quantity and location found to be sparse and inaccurate. A full liquidation plan for Agridime is expected by the end of July.
