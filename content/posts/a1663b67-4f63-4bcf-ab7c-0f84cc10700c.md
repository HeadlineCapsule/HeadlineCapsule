爆炸性弹药并购案让股东陷入困境

**维斯塔户外** 面临困境，因为其弹药业务被卷入并购竞价战中，股东们对最佳行动方案感到不确定。这家总部位于明尼苏达州的公司有两个部门：一个制造枪弹，另一个销售运动和户外设备（如望远镜）。

去年秋天，维斯塔宣布以不到 20 亿美元的价格将其弹药业务出售给**捷克斯洛伐克集团（CSG）**。剩余的上市公司户外用品部门，称为 Revelyst，将以约 50 美元每股的价格估值，总股本价值 30 亿美元。然而，由于右翼美国政客出于国家安全考虑提出担忧，CSG 交易尚未完成。

前维斯塔董事马克·戈特弗雷森（Mark Gottfredson）的家庭办公室**MNC Capital**以每股 39.50 美元的全现金要约收购该公司，高于其当前 36 美元的交易价格。一家未具名的投资公司也提交了竞争性报价，竞购弹药业务，同时CSG 陷入困境。

维斯塔表示将探索 MNC Capital 的加价要约，并提及保留 Revelyst 的潜在好处，例如更高的 EBITDA 利润率和健康的利润倍数。然而，股东们对实现目标的执行风险以及与理论价值相比的股票交易价格折扣感到怀疑。

这一情况突显了外国买家如何能引起美国政客的抵制，正如美国钢铁公司（US Steel）与日本 Nippon Steel 150 亿美元交易所见。维斯塔户外必须在复杂的多元化并购环境中权衡每个要约的利弊，同时考虑股东的利益。

 **Vista Outdoor** faces a dilemma as its explosive ammo business is caught in an M&A bidding war, leaving shareholders uncertain about the best course of action. The Minnesota-based company has two divisions: one that manufactures gun ammunition and another selling sporting and outdoor equipment like binoculars.

Last autumn, Vista announced a sale of its ammo business to **Czechoslovak Group (CSG)** at just under $2bn. The remaining publicly traded outdoor goods division, known as Revelyst, would then be valued at about $50 per share or a total equity value of $3bn. However, the CSG deal has yet to close due to concerns raised by right-wing American politicians over national security grounds.

**MNC Capital**, the family office of former Vista director Mark Gottfredson, stepped in with an all-cash bid for the company at $39.50 per share, higher than its current trading price of $36. An unnamed investment firm also submitted a competing offer for the ammo business amid CSG's troubles.

Vista stated that it would explore MNC Capital's topping bid and mentioned potential benefits from retaining Revelyst, such as increased ebitda margins and healthy profit multiples. However, shareholders remain skeptebalanced by the execution risk of hitting targets and the stock trading at a steep discount compared to both theoretical values.

The situation highlights how foreign buyers can provoke resistance from American politicians, as seen in other cases like US Steel's $15bn deal with Japan's Nippon Steel. Vista Outdoor must weigh the pros and cons of each bid while considering its shareholders' interests amidst this complex M&A landscape.
