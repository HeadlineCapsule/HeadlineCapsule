# 美国因拉法攻势担忧而暂停对以色列的炸弹运送

上周，**美国**因担忧**以色列**在**拉法**的潜在地面行动而暂停了**炸弹**运送，这是**哈马斯-以色列冲突**于 10 月爆发以来，华盛顿首次暂停**武器销售**。在就拉法平民的**人道主义影响**与以色列讨论后，美国仍担忧未减，因而做出此决定。该决定的审查过程始于 4 月，最终美国暂停了 1,800 枚 2,000 磅炸弹和 1,700 枚 500 磅炸弹的运送。

**美国官员**尤其担忧 2,000 磅炸弹在**人口稠密地区**的使用，这与加沙此前发生的事件类似。除了炸弹运送外，美国还非正式地推迟了**联合直接攻击弹药 (JDAM) 组件**和**小直径炸弹**的运送。这些案件以及美国国务院的其他案件仍在接受审查，以确定未来的转运事宜。美国仍致力于提供以色列全部 141 亿美元的补充资金，该资金于上个月批准，并刚刚授权了价值 8.27 亿美元的武器和设备。

随着以色列威胁要扩大其在拉法的行动，拜登政府专注于防止该人口稠密边境城市的平民伤亡，这成为一个争议点。以色列为自己的行动辩护称，拉法是哈马斯的**据点**，根据以色列方面的说法，哈马斯最近入侵了以色列南部，造成约 1,200 人死亡，并劫持了 250 人质。而根据巴勒斯坦卫生官员的报告，以色列的报复性攻势已导致加沙近 35,000 人死亡。

# US paused shipment to Israel over concerns about Rafah offensive

The **United States** paused a **shipment of bombs** to **Israel** last week due to concerns about a potential ground operation in **Rafah**, marking the first time Washington has withheld a **weapons sale** since the **Hamas-Israel conflict** began in October. This decision was made after discussions with Israel regarding the **humanitarian impact** on civilians in Rafah fell short of assuaging US concerns. The review process for this decision started in April, and the US ultimately withheld 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. 

**US officials** are particularly concerned about the use of 2,000-pound bombs in **dense urban areas**, similar to previous incidents in Gaza. In addition to the bomb shipment, the US has also informally delayed shipments of **Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits** and **small-diameter bombs**. These cases, along with others at the State Department, are still under review for future transfers. The US remains committed to providing Israel with the full $14.1 billion in supplemental funding approved last month and has just authorized $827 million in weapons and equipment. 

/n/n

As Israel threatens to expand its operation in Rafah, the Biden administration's focus on preventing civilian casualties in the densely populated border city creates a point of contention. Israel justifies its actions by claiming that Rafah is a **stronghold** for Hamas, which recently invaded southern Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures. In contrast, the Palestinian health officials report that Israel's retaliatory offensive has resulted in the deaths of nearly 35,000 people in Gaza.
