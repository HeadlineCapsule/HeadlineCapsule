# **欧盟**在美国对 **中国新商品** 征收关税后面临压力

**美国** 最近对部分中国商品征收关税，包括对 **电动汽车** 征收100%的关税，这对 **欧盟** 的贸易格局产生了重大影响。这些关税预计将导致中国出口转向欧盟，加剧了欧盟与中国之间的贸易逆差，2023年欧盟对中国的贸易逆差达到了2900亿欧元。**布鲁塞尔**正急于保护其国内绿色技术产业，避免被卷入美国与中国之间不断升级的贸易战。欧盟官员承认他们在全球贸易冲突中权力有限，正寻求与西方盟友协调以解决这一问题。然而，欧盟在是否对中国公司采取更强硬措施的问题上仍存在分歧，担心报复和遵守世贸组织规则的问题阻碍了他们的行动。**唐纳德·特朗普** 可能重返白宫，进一步复杂化了这一局面，他此前曾对欧盟的钢铝进口征收关税。随着欧盟努力应对这些挑战，分析人士预测中国公司将继续从欧盟市场中获利，凸显出采取协调一致应对措施的紧迫性。

# EU under pressure after US levies tariffs on **new** Chinese goods 

The **United States'** recent imposition of tariffs on select Chinese goods, including a 100% tariff on **electric vehicles**, has significant implications for the **European Union's** trade dynamics. The tariffs are expected to redirect Chinese exports towards the EU, exacerbating the bloc's trade deficit with China, which stood at €290bn in 2023. **Brussels** is scrambling to protect its domestic green technology industries and avoid being dragged into the escalating trade war between the US and China. EU officials acknowledge their limited powers in this global trade conflict and are seeking to coordinate with western allies to address the issue. However, the bloc remains divided on taking stronger action against Chinese companies, hampered by concerns of retaliation and a desire to adhere to WTO rules. The situation is further complicated by the potential return of **Donald Trump** to the White House, who previously imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports. As the EU grapples with these challenges, analysts predict that Chinese companies will continue to find the EU market profitable, underscoring the urgency for a coordinated response.
