英伟达市值跳涨3500亿美元，因“感马效应”

# 摘要：英伟达市值激增 3500 亿美元，出现“伽马挤压”现象

英伟达（Nvidia）的市值显著增长，自 5 月 23 日发布第一季度财报以来，其市值跳涨了令人瞩目的 **3500 亿美元**。这种增长归因于英伟达庞大的期权市场中激烈的期权交易活动所导致的“伽马挤压”现象。

截至周五，这家芯片制造商的估值达到 **2.69 万亿美元**，超过了摩根大通、伯克希尔哈撒韦和Meta等公司的总和。自 5 月 23 日以来，该公司市值增加约 3500 亿美元，其最高峰值于本周早些时候上涨近半万亿美元。

“伽马挤压”是指当大量买入看涨期权时，经纪人被迫购买基础股票作为潜在损失的对冲。这种自我强化的循环推动了英伟达股价的上涨，进一步刺激了对看涨期权的需求，从而促进了其市值激增。

尽管周五收盘下跌 0.8%，但英伟达已经显着缩小了与苹果和微软等美国市场中两个最大公司的差距。该公司最近的业绩超预期、上调的指导以及股票拆分都为这种势头做出了贡献。

由于高利润率（超过 50%）以及与生成式人工智能技术的关联，该技术依赖于英伟达的芯片，因此英伟达与其他网络股聚集地的不同之处在于其高利润率以及与生成式人工智能技术的关联。这激发了投资者对英伟达作为“完美势头股”的热情。

**问题：**

1. 伽马挤压是什么，它如何促进了英伟达市值的增长？
2. 生成式人工智能技术的表现如何影响了投资者对英伟达的看法？
3. 请解释为什么英伟达最近的业绩超预期、上调指导和股票拆分被视为交易者潜在的伽马挤压触发因素？
4. 哪些因素使英伟达与GameStop等其他网络股聚集地的不同？
5. 首席财务官（CFO）的投资决策如何影响英伟达市值增长未来的轨迹？

**Summary: Nvidia's Market Cap Soars by $350bn Amid 'Gamma Squeeze'**

Nvidia has experienced a significant surge in its market capitalization, jumping by an impressive **$350 billion** since the company reported first-quarter earnings on May 23. This increase is attributed to a "gamma squeeze" phenomenon driven by intense options trading activity within Nvidia's substantial options market.

The chipmaker's valuation reached **$2.69 trillion** as of Friday, surpassing the combined value of JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, and Meta. The company has added roughly $350 billion in market capitalization since May 23, with its peak value rising by nearly half a trillion dollars earlier this week.

A "gamma squeeze" occurs when bulk buying of call options forces brokers to purchase shares in the underlying stock as a hedge against potential losses. This self-reinforcing cycle has propelled Nvidia's share price higher, further driving demand for calls and contributing to its market cap surge.

Despite closing down 0.8% on Friday, Nvidia has significantly narrowed the gap with Apple and Microsoft as two of the largest companies in US markets. The company's recent earnings beat, raised guidance, and a stock split have all contributed to this momentum.

Nvidia stands out from other meme-stock rallies due to its high profit margins (above 50%) and its association with generative artificial intelligence technology, which relies on the company's chips. This has fueled investor enthusiasm for Nvidia as a "perfect momentum stock."

**Questions:**

1. What is a gamma squeeze, and how did it contribute to Nvidia's market cap surge?
2. How does the performance of generative artificial intelligence technology impact investor sentiment towards Nvidia?
3. Can you explain why Nvidia's recent earnings beat, raised guidance, and stock split are considered potential triggers for a gamma squeeeby traders?
4. What factors differentiate Nvidia from other meme-stock rallies like GameStop?
5. How might the investment decisions of CFOs impact the future trajectory of Nvidia's market cap growth?
