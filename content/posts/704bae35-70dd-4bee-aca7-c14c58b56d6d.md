# 单纯增加资本金不是答案

**耶鲁大学金融稳定计划研究助理主任 Steven Kelly** 对 **资本金要求**、**流动性** 以及银行在维护金融稳定中扮演的角色发表了见解。Kelly 与摩根大通的杰米·戴蒙观点一致，认为单纯提高资本金要求并不能显著降低金融危机的风险，灵活性才是关键。他强调，需要采取细致入微的方法，考虑到银行的 **存款特许权** 对经济的敏感性及其在混乱的市场中进行干预的能力。Kelly 承认监管一个复杂体系的挑战，建议银行与监管机构采取协作的方法来评估风险并确定适当的资本水平。他还强调了 **具有系统重要性的银行** 与其他信贷提供者之间的区别，认为将银行活动推向不受监管的领域可能并没有那么有害。Kelly 最后主张监管 **稳定币** 和 **货币市场基金**，并改革 **存款保险**，以更好地管理系统性风险。

# More capital is not the answer

**Steven Kelly**, associate director of research at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, offers insights into **capital requirements**, **liquidity**, and the role of banks in maintaining financial stability. Kelly agrees with JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon that simply increasing capital requirements may not significantly reduce the risk of financial crises, and that flexibility is key. He emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach that considers the economic sensitivity of a bank's **deposit franchise** and its ability to intervene in disrupted markets. While acknowledging the challenges of regulating a complex system, Kelly suggests a collaborative approach between banks and supervisors to assess risk and determine appropriate capital levels. He also highlights the distinction between **systemically important banks** and other credit providers, arguing that pushing banking activities into an unregulated realm may not be as detrimental as suggested. Kelly concludes by advocating for the regulation of **stablecoins** and **money market funds**, and reform of **deposit insurance** to better manage systemic risk.
