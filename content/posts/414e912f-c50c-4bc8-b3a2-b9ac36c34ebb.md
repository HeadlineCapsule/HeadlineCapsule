印度吸引科技巨头实现人工智能雄心

# 印度积极追求成为人工智能（AI）领先中心的雄心，而微软和亚马逊等科技巨头正向该国的计算基础设施投资数十亿美元。

印度政府为技术公司提供了激励措施，旨在将印度转变为人工智能的重要消费者与出口国。

据报道，微软向印度南部的特兰加纳州承诺投资37亿美元，计划建造数据中心，增加660兆瓦（MW）的IT容量。亚马逊打算到2030年对云基础设施投资约127亿美元。

微软印度和南亚区总裁普尼特·钱德克（Puneet Chandok）对印度市场在当地和全球的技术创新潜力表示兴奋。大科技公司争相在印度建造自己数据中心的趋势，预计将推动印度成为亚太地区自建容量排名第一的国家。

“主权AI”的概念促使各国政府要求在其境内设立数据中心，重点关注国防、军事和国家安全应用。印度等快速增长的经济体推动了这一需求，为微软和亚马逊等云服务提供商创造了巨大的可开发市场。

然而，数据中心的激增因高电力和水耗要求而引起环境担忧。尽管存在这一挑战，微软仍致力于通过与ReNew等可再生能源公司的协议在2030年之前实现碳负排放的目标。

 **Summary:**  
India is actively pursuing its ambition to become a leading artificial intelligence (AI) hub as major tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon invest billions into the country's computing infrastructure. The Indian government has offered incentives for technology companies, aiming to transform India into both a significant consumer and exporter of AI.

Microsoft is reportedly committing $3.7 billion to Telangana state in southern India, with plans to construct data centers that would add 660 megawatts (MW) of IT capacity. Amazon intends to invest approximately $12.7 billion in cloud infrastructure by 2030.

Puneet Chandok, Microsoft's president for India and South Asia, expressed excitement about the Indian market's potential for tech innovation both locally and globally. The rush of Big Tech companies to build their own data centers in India is expected to propel it to the top spot by self-built capacity in the Asia Pacific region.

The concept of "sovereign AI" has fueled demand among national governments for data centers within their borders, focusing on defense, military, and national security applications. This push from fast-growing economies like India creates a significant addressable market for cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon.

However, the surge in data centers poses environmental concerns due to high electricity and water consumption requirements. Despite this challenge, Microsoft remains committed to its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 through agreements with renewable energy companies like ReNew.
