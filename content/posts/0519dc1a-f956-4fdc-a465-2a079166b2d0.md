避免公司倒闭的处方

# 防止企业失败的处方
英国需要更怀疑的审计师和更严格的监管机构

“专业判断是任何审计的重要特征”，英国监管机构金融报告委员会在2022年敦促审计师提高他们的怀疑态度。在评估企业是否为“持续经营”时，独立的心态尤其重要。除了内部控制和潜在的欺诈之外，决定一家公司是否有破产风险也是审计师的一个关键重点。根据新的研究，英国公司在这个方面做得不够好。

审计改革实验室（ARL），一个智库，表示在2010年至2022年之间，审计师未能在75%的英国大型企业倒闭之前拉响警报。它指出，审计师的表现不佳，合伙人的薪酬却很高——而且还在上升——监管也无效。

审计师有时犹豫是否发出持续经营警告是可以理解的。正如近年来大流行病和战争的不可预见的影响所表明的那样，评估对企业的未来威胁是困难的。欺诈是审计师应该更加警惕的另一个领域，它有时会

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: What are the main reasons for auditors failing to sound the alarm before corporate collapses?
   A: The article suggests that there are several factors contributing to this issue. Auditors may hesitate due to difficulties in assessing future threats, conflicts of interest with more lucrative non-audit opportunities, and potential distractions from their clients' management and board when issuing warnings. Additionally, the high partner pay and rising regulation costs are mentioned as contributing factors.
   
2. Q: How can regulatory reform help improve auditor scrutiny?
   A: Regulatory reform could establish a stronger watchdog, such as the proposed Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga), which would have more funding and authority to hold audit firms accountable. This would enable better quality audits by providing clearer guidance and support for auditors in their assessments of going concern risks.
   
3. Q: What are the potential consequences of issuing a "material uncertainty" paragraph?
   A: Including a "material uncertainty" paragraph can deter suppliers and customers from shipping goods or paying bills, potentially leading to a self-fulfilling crisis of cash and confidence for the company. However, it is also seen as preferable to issuing an opinion that a company is solid when it may not be, thus serving as a warning rather than a prediction.

        A prescription to curb corporate failures
        The UK needs more sceptical auditors and a tougher regulator 
        “Professional judgment is a critical feature of any audit,” according to the UK watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, which in 2022 urged auditors to sharpen their scepticism. An independent mindset is particularly important when it comes to assessing whether a business is a “going concern”. Alongside internal controls and the potential for fraud, deciding whether a company risks going bankrupt is a critical focus for auditors. It is here, according to new research, that UK firms are falling short.
The Audit Reform Lab (ARL), a think-tank, says auditors failed to sound the alarm before 75 per cent of big UK corporate collapses between 2010 and 2022. While auditor performance is poor, partner pay is high — and rising — and regulation is ineffective, it points out.
It is understandable that auditors sometimes hesitate to pull the trigger on going concern warnings. Assessing future threats to a business is hard, as the unforeseen impact of pandemic and war has shown in recent years. Fraud — another area where auditors could be more alert — sometimes
