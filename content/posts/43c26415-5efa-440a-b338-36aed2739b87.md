乌克兰将启动加入欧盟的谈判

**乌克兰和摩尔多瓦开始加入欧盟的谈判**

在基辅的欧广场抗议活动（Euromaidan）发生十多年后，乌克兰将开始与欧洲联盟（EU）的入盟谈判。这是标志着该国向西方看齐的象征性举动。与此同时，俄罗斯的全面入侵已经持续了三年之久。

欧盟部长将于周二在卢森堡与乌克兰官员会面，正式启动一个预计将历时多年的进程。对于继续抵抗俄罗斯侵略的乌克兰来说，这是一个重要时刻。乌克兰负责欧洲和欧大西洋一体化事务的副总理奥尔哈·斯蒂法尼申娜（Olha Stefanishyna）表示，该国已经超越了从承诺到交付的障碍，满足了开始谈判所需的所有标准。

德国外长安娜莱娜·贝尔博克（Annalena Baerbock）也强调了这一步骤的重要性，称：“普京想吞并乌克兰。相反，[该国]现在比以往任何时候都更接近欧盟。” 欧盟还将与摩尔多瓦开始谈判，这个前苏联共和国在俄罗斯于2022年入侵乌克兰后几周申请加入欧盟。

在这些会议上，两国将获得一份“谈判框架”，概述了它们在准备加入欧盟之前需要采用的改革和立法。入盟谈判的启动时间战略性地安排在匈牙利——欧盟中最亲俄的成员国——于7月1日接任轮值主席国之前。

乌克兰副总理斯蒂法尼申娜表示，从2025年开始，他们将推动非常动态的入盟进程。谈判的开始标志着乌克兰迈出了重要的一步，根据民调，大约90%的乌克兰人希望看到该国的未来在欧盟。

2013年的欧广场起义见证了数万乌克兰人抗议亲俄总统维克多·亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovich）决定退出与欧盟的紧密协会协议，最终导致他逃往俄罗斯，而乌克兰则坚定地走上了向西方看齐的道路。尽管俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京威胁不允许乌克兰离开他所称的势力范围，但在起义期间，超过100名抗议者（被称为“天堂百魂”）和9名警察被打死。

普京随后吞并克里米亚、在乌克兰东部顿巴斯地区发动战争以及全面入侵已经夺走了联合国数据显示的超过1.5万平民的生命，实际数字可能更高。在军事方面，基辅报告自2022年以来有超过10万名士兵受伤或死亡，而西方首都估计俄罗斯军伤亡至少35万人。

 **Ukraine and Moldova Begin EU Accession Talks**

In a symbolic move marking over a decade of pro-western aspirations since the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv, Ukraine will start European Union (EU) accession talks on Tuesday. This step comes amidst Russia's full-scale invasion that has persisted for three years.

The EU ministers are set to meet Ukrainian officials in Luxembourg to officially commence a process expected to span several years, signifying an important moment for Ukraine as it continues its fight against Russian aggression. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, expressed that the country has surpassed the barrier of promise to delivery in meeting all criteria necessary for negotiations to commence.

German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock also emphasized the significance of this step, stating: "Putin wanted to annex Ukraine. Instead, [the country] is now closer to the EU than ever before." The bloc will also begin talks with neighboring Moldova, a former Soviet republic that applied for EU membership weeks after Russia's 2t022 invasion of Ukraine.

During these meetings, both countries will be presented with a "negotiating framework" outlining the reforms and legislation they need to adopt before being deemed ready to join the EU. The start of accession talks is timed strategically to occur before Hungary, the most pro-Russia member in the EU, takes over the rotating presidency on July 1st.

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Stefanishyna stated that from 2025, they will push for a very dynamic accession process. The start of talks signifies a monumental step for Ukraine, with roughly 90% of Ukrainians polled expressing their desire to see their future in the EU.

The Euromaidan uprising in 2013 saw tens of thousands of Ukrainians protest pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovich's decision to pull out of a closer association agreement with the EU, leading to his eventual refuge in Russia and Ukraine firmly on a pro-western path. Despite threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin not to allow Ukraine to leave what he describes as his sphere of influence, over 100 protesters known as the "heavenly hundred" and nine police officers were killed during the uprising.

Putin's subsequent annexation of Crimea, war in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, and the full-scale invasion have cost more than 15,000 civilian lives according to the UN, with the real figure likely being much higher. On the military side, Kyiv has reported over 100,000 soldiers wounded or killed since 2022, while Western capitals estimate Russian casualties at least 350,000.
