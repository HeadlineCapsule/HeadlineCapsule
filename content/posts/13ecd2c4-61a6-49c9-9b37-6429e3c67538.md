# **尼日尔** 与 **贝宁** 的边境争端阻碍了中国建造的石油管道

**尼日尔** 这个非洲内陆国家，正处在成为该地区石油工业重要参与者的边缘，但这取决于它是否能解决与邻国 **贝宁** 之间的 **边境争端**。由 **中国石油化工集团（CNPC）** 建设的长达 2,000 公里的管道最近竣工，尼日尔可以开始出口石油。然而，由于 **西非国家经济共同体（ECOWAS）** 在尼日尔发生军事政变后实施了制裁，该项目被推迟。

这条管道每天可输送 11 万桶石油，用于将尼日尔 **阿加德姆裂谷** 的库雷勒油田的石油输送到贝宁的塞梅港。尼日尔目前的石油日产量为 2 万桶，主要来自中国石油化工集团的项目，但由于缺乏出口路线，石油只能在国内消费。国际货币基金组织（IMF）预计，这条管道将大幅提升尼日尔经济，预计该国今年将实现 11% 的经济增长率。

然而，与贝宁的边境争端带来了严峻挑战。尽管西非国家经济共同体的制裁已经解除，但尼日尔仍以安全问题为由拒绝重新开放与贝宁的陆地边境，并指责贝宁违反贸易协议。这给从事跨境贸易的贝宁企业造成了压力，也影响了新管道潜在的石油输送。贝宁总统 **帕特里斯·塔隆** 断言，尼日尔石油的出口取决于其是否重新开放边境。

尼日尔不断变化的地缘政治联盟进一步加剧了局势的复杂性。该国最近背离了传统的西方盟友，导致法国和美国军队撤离，转而寻求俄罗斯和中国等其他伙伴。中国尤其向尼日尔提供了 4 亿美元贷款，用于偿还债务，并可用石油出口来偿还。中国与尼日尔和贝宁都保持着友好关系，但预计将置身于边境争端之外，视尼日尔为长期战略伙伴。

随着尼日尔新统治者优先考虑经济主权并建立新的联盟，解决与贝宁的边境争端成为释放该国石油出口潜力和推动经济增长的关键。

# Border dispute hinders Niger's China-built oil pipeline

**Niger**, a landlocked country in Africa, is on the brink of becoming a significant player in the regional oil industry, but this hinges on resolving a **border dispute** with its neighboring country, **Benin**. The recent completion of a 2,000-kilometer pipeline, constructed by **China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)**, positions Niger to export its oil production. However, the project has been delayed due to sanctions imposed by the **Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)** following a military coup in Niger. 

The pipeline, with a capacity of 110,000 barrels per day, is designed to transport oil from Niger's Koulele oilfields in the **Agadem Rift Basin** to the port of Seme in Benin. Niger currently produces 20,000 barrels per day, mostly from CNPC projects, but lacks export routes, resulting in domestic consumption of its oil. The pipeline is expected to boost Niger's economy significantly, with the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** forecasting an 11% growth rate for the country this year. 

However, the border dispute with Benin poses a critical challenge. Despite the lifting of ECOWAS sanctions, Niger has refused to reopen its land borders with Benin, citing security concerns and accusing its neighbor of violating trade agreements. This has strained Beninese businesses engaged in cross-border trade and impacted the potential flow of oil through the new pipeline. Benin's president, **Patrice Talon**, has asserted that oil exports from Niger are contingent upon the reopening of its borders. 

The situation is further complicated by Niger's shifting geopolitical alliances. The country has recently pivoted away from traditional western allies, leading to the departure of French and US troops, and toward alternative partners like Russia and China. China, in particular, has provided a $400 million loan to Niger to repay its debts, to be repaid with oil exports. While China maintains amicable relations with both Niger and Benin, it is expected to remain on the sidelines of the border dispute, viewing Niger as a long-term strategic partner. 

As Niger's new rulers prioritize economic sovereignty and forge new alliances, the resolution of the border dispute with Benin becomes crucial for unlocking the country's oil export potential and driving economic growth.
