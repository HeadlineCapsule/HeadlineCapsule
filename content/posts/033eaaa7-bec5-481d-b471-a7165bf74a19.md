第一财：西方企业放弃退出俄罗斯市场的计划

**摘要：** 包括雅芳公司、液化空气集团和瑞科派特在内的西方企业，尽管最初计划在乌克兰被入侵后退出俄罗斯市场，但仍然留在了俄罗斯。基辅经济学学校发现，自战争开始以来，超过 2100 家跨国公司留在俄罗斯，而大约 1600 家国际公司则退出或缩减了业务。随着官僚主义障碍增加和消费者活动反弹，企业面临的离开困难加剧。莫斯科提高了企业离境成本，强制对来自“不友好”国家的资产实施 50% 的折扣出售给俄罗斯买家，并征收最低金额的**离境税**。

**有趣的问题：**

1. **问题：有哪些因素导致西方企业决定留在俄罗斯，尽管最初计划退出？**
   **答案：** 像雅芳公司、液化空气集团和瑞科派特这样的西方公司决定留在俄罗斯可以归因于几个因素，例如增加的官僚主义障碍，使他们很难离开该国。此外，消费者活动的复苏可能为这些企业提供了持续的市场机会，尽管存在地缘政治紧张局势。莫斯科对企业离境征收的财务罚款，包括强制性折扣和离境税，也增加了企业离开俄罗斯市场的巨大成本。

2. **问题：俄罗斯的政策如何影响了其境内跨国公司的运营？**
   **答案：** 为了应对地缘政治紧张局势，俄罗斯实施了多种措施来阻止跨国公司退出其市场，例如强制对来自“不友好”国家的资产实施 50% 的折扣，并引入了离境税。这些政策增加了希望离开俄罗斯的公司的财务负担，使它们更难实现最初的计划或意图。

3. **问题：西方企业在俄罗斯的地缘政治紧张局势中继续运营可能产生什么长期后果？**
   **答案：** 西方企业决定留在俄罗斯可能有几个长期影响，包括与母国和其他国际合作伙伴的关系紧张的可能性。这些公司可能会面临声誉风险，因为它们继续在政治上充满争议的环境中运营。此外，这些公司可能会受到进一步的监管变化或制裁的影响，这可能会影响它们在俄罗斯和其他地区的业务。另一方面，留在俄罗斯使他们能够维持市场存在并利用地缘政治变化的潜在机会。

**Summary:** Western businesses, including Avon Products, Air Liquide, and Reckitt, have remained in Russia despite initially planning to exit after the invasion of Ukraine. The Kyiv School of Economics found that over 2,100 multinational companies stayed in Russia since the war began, compared with about 1,600 international companies that quit or scaled back operations. Companies are facing increased bureaucratic obstacles and consumer activity rebounds, making it harder to leave. Moscow has raised costs for corporate departure by imposing a mandatory 50% discount on assets from "unfriendly" countries sold to Russian buyers and a minimum amo

**Interesting Questions:**
1. **Q: What factors have contributed to Western businesses deciding to remain in Russia despite initial plans to exit?**  
A: The decision of Western companies like Avon Products, Air Liquide, and Reckitt to stay in Russia can be attributed to several factors such as increased bureaucratic obstacles that make it difficult for them to leave the country. Additionally, a rebound in consumer activity has likely provided these businesses with continued market opportunities despite geopolitical tensions. Moscow's imposition of financial penalties on corporate departures, including mandatory discounts and exit taxes, also adds significant costs that may deter companies from leaving the Russian market.
2. **Q: How have Russia's policies impacted multinnational companies operating within its borders?**  
A: Russia has implemented several measures to dissuade multinational companies from exiting its market in response to geopolitical tensions, such as imposing a mandatory 50% discount on assets sold by "unfriendly" countries and introducing an exit tax. These policies have increased the financial burden for companies looking to leave Russia, making it more challenging for them to do so despite initial plans or intentions.
3. **Q: What are some potential long-term consequences of Western businesses remaining in Russia amidst geopolitical tensions?**  
A: The decision by Western businesses to remain in Russia could have several long-term implications, including the possibility of strained relationships with their home countries and other international partners. Companies may face reputational risks as they continue operating within a politically contentious environment. Additionally, these companies might be subjected to further regulatory changes or sanctions that could impact their operations in Russia and beyond. On the flip side, staying in Russia allows them to maintain market presence and capitalize on potential opportunities arising from geopolitical shifts.
