# 日本企业的非核心房地产资产带来770亿美元的收益，成为激进投资者的目标 

**日本企业**（不包括房地产行业）去年仅从其**非核心房地产资产**中就获得了惊人的770亿美元的账面利润。这一大幅增长引起了关注并加大了这些公司的压力，因为投资者推动出售资产以释放大量价值。在即将到来的6月年度会议季期间，预计这个问题将成为关键议题，届时2,000多家上市公司将与股东进行接触。 

**高盛的分析**显示，跨越食品生产、玻璃制造、广告和金融服务等多元化行业的超过**250家公司**产生了这些账面利润。许多公司在20世纪80年代积累了房地产资产，但以前从未考虑过出售它们。这种情况为股东大会上的潜在摩擦创造了条件，而**东京证券交易所**对资本效率和估值的强调加剧了这一局面。 

日本真正的房地产企业，如三菱地所(Mitsubishi Estate)和东京建物(Tokyo Tatemono)，其股价自1月份以来上涨了20%以上，这进一步突显出这些专业公司与持有大量房地产资产的非房产公司之间的差异。高盛的日本股票策略师**布鲁斯·卡克**(Bruce Kirk)强调指出，股东们正在越来越多地质疑这些非核心业务存在的理由。为日本企业提供激进投资者防御战略咨询服务的银行家承认，现在投资者将这些房地产持仓视为负债而非特例，使得这些公司容易受到激进投资者的影响。 

由于2010年的**会计变更**要求披露投资性房产的账面价值和市场价值，因此办公室空间和其他房地产资产的未实现收益或损失受到了严格关注。非房地产公司的账面利润几乎与日本房地产行业本身宣布的利润相当（770亿美元对890亿美元）。随着埃利奥特管理公司(Elliott Management)等激进投资者就其非核心房产资产问题不断施压，要求在今年的股东大会季做出解释的声音越来越高。 Kirk预测这些庞大的房地产组合将受到更严格的审查，并认为当前良好的企业治理势头有利于那些寻求从低估的房地产持有中释放价值的投资者。

# Corporate Japan's $77bn in property gains offer target for activists 

**Japanese corporations**, excluding those in the real estate sector, realized an astounding $77 billion in paper profits last year from their **non-core property portfolios**. This substantial increase has attracted attention and heightened pressure on these companies as investors advocate for asset sales to unlock significant value. The issue is expected to be a key topic during the upcoming June annual meeting season when more than 2,000 listed companies engage with shareholders.

**Goldman Sachs' analysis** revealed that over **250 companies**, spanning diverse industries such as food production, glass manufacturing, advertising, and financial services, generated these paper profits. Many of these businesses accumulated property assets during the 1980s but have never had to consider selling them until now. This situation sets the stage for potential friction at shareholder meetings, exacerbated by the **Tokyo Stock Exchange's** emphasis on capital efficiency and valuations.

The recent performance of actual real estate companies in Japan, such as Mitsubishi Estate and Tokyo Tatemono, with shares up more than 20% since January, further highlights the discrepancy between these specialists and non-real estate companies holding extensive property portfolios. **Bruce Kirk**, Goldman's Japan equity strategist, emphasized that shareholders are increasingly questioning the justification for these non-core businesses. Bankers advising Japanese companies on activist defense strategies acknowledge that investors now view these property holdings as a liability rather than a peculiarity, making these companies vulnerable to shareholder activism campaigns. 

With **accounting changes** in 2010 requiring disclosure of book and market values for investment properties, the spotlight is firmly on unrealized gains or losses from office spaces and other real estate assets. The paper gains declared by non-real estate companies are nearly comparable to those announced by Japan's real estate industry itself ($77 billion vs $89 billion). As activist funds like Elliott Management engage with Japanese corporations over their non-core property assets, the pressure is mounting for a reckoning during this year's AGM season. Kirk predicts intensified scrutiny of these extensive portfolios and suggests that corporate governance momentum currently favors investors seeking to unlock value from undervalued real estate holdings.
