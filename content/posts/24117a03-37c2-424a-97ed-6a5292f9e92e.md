# 英国无家可归者人数为何居世界之首？

人们往往会将**无家可归**与**露宿街头**和**吸毒**联系在一起，但实际上大多数无家可归者都住在**临时住所**，因为他们负担不起长期住房。 英国是经合组织（OECD）中无家可归率最高的国家，在英格兰，每200户家庭中就有1户住在**紧急住宿**中。 这种无家可归的形式往往被忽视，但它影响着数十万人，使他们生活条件恶劣，生活陷入混乱。

造成英格兰临时住所家庭数量激增的原因是多种因素的完美风暴：**住房建设**不足、**社会住房**部门萎缩和**国家财政支持**减少。 英国**住房建设量**低导致私营部门租金上涨，而自20世纪70年代以来**社会住房**数量减少25%，这意味着重要的安全网也随之消失。 **住房补贴**冻结使问题更加恶化，现在有 fewer 私人租赁房屋可以享受补贴。

这些因素的相互作用导致了一种糟糕的局面，使人们陷入**绝望**和**贫困**。 在英格兰，负担不起房租已经成为新的无家可归问题的主要驱动因素。 市场价格住房和补贴住房都对解决这一危机至关重要，奥地利和芬兰的“住房第一”方法的成功就证明了这一点。 然而，由于负担得起的住房供应有限，该方法在英格兰的试点面临挑战。 这一危机突出表明，迫切需要增加住房供应并提高住房可负担性，以防止更多人陷入无家可归的境地。

# How Britain became the world’s worst on homelessness

**Homelessness** is often associated with **rough sleeping** and **substance abuse**, but the main form is people residing in **temporary accommodation**, unable to afford permanent housing. The UK has the highest rate of homelessness among OECD countries, with 1 in 200 households in England living in **emergency lodging**. This form of homelessness is often overlooked, yet it affects hundreds of thousands of people, subjecting them to poor living conditions and disrupting their lives. 

/n/n

The surge in English households in temporary accommodation is attributed to a perfect storm of factors: inadequate **housebuilding**, a shrinking **social housing** sector, and diminishing **state financial support**. The UK's low **housebuilding rates** have driven up private sector rents, while a 25% reduction in social housing since the 1970s has removed a vital safety net. **Housing benefit** freezes have exacerbated the issue, with fewer private rented homes now covered by benefits. 

/n/n

The interplay of these factors has resulted in a dire situation, pushing people into **despair** and **destitution**. The inability to afford rent has become the primary driver of new homelessness in England. Both market-rate and subsidized housing are crucial to addressing this crisis, as evidenced by the success of the "housing first" approach in Austria and Finland. However, the pilot of this approach in England faced challenges due to the limited availability of affordable housing. The crisis underscores the urgent need to increase housing supply and improve affordability to prevent more people from falling into homelessness.
