# **BBVA** 发起对 **Sabadell** 115 亿欧元的敌意收购

西班牙第二大银行 **BBVA** 对竞争对手 **Banco Sabadell** 发起了敌意收购，提出了一项全股票交易，价值 115 亿欧元。此举发生在 **Sabadell 董事会拒绝了 BBVA 的最初提议**，声称该提议“严重低估”了该行及其增长前景。

**BBVA** 现直接向 Sabadell 股东提出收购要约，每股作价 2.13 欧元，较周三收盘价溢价 18%。合并后将成为西班牙市场国内资产负债表最大的贷款机构。 **BBVA 董事长卡洛斯·托雷斯** 将该要约称为“极具吸引力”，而 Sabadell 董事会坚称该出价低估了银行的价值。两家银行之间的争执日益公开，在敌意收购提议罕见的西班牙，这是一种不寻常的情况。随着该交易有望重塑西班牙银行业格局，人们的目光现在转向 Sabadell 的股东及其对 **BBVA** 收购要约的反应。

# BBVA launches €11.5bn hostile bid for Sabadell

**BBVA**, Spain's second-largest bank, has launched a hostile takeover bid for its smaller rival, **Banco Sabadell**, offering €11.5 billion in an all-share deal. This move comes after the **Sabadell board rejected BBVA's initial approach**, stating that it "significantly undervalued" the bank and its growth prospects.

BBVA is now taking the offer directly to Sabadell's shareholders, valuing each share at €2.13, an 18% premium to the stock's closing price on Wednesday. This would create a lender with the biggest domestic balance sheet in the Spanish market. **BBVA chair Carlos Torres** defended the offer as "extraordinarily attractive," while Sabadell's board remains adamant that the bid undervalues the bank. The increasingly public spat between the two banks is an unusual occurrence in Spain, where hostile bids are rare. With the deal's potential to reshape the Spanish banking landscape, all eyes are now on Sabadell's shareholders and their response to BBVA's offer.
