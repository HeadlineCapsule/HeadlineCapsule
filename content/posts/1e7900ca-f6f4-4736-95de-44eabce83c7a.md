美元树考虑出售经营不善的家庭美元折扣店

**美元树** 考虑将其陷入困境的 **Family Dollar折扣店** 出售，这是战略审查过程的一部分。这次可能的出售将逆转十年前以85亿美元收购的收购，最初是由激进投资者卡尔·伊坎和尼尔森·佩尔特兹施加的压力所驱动的。

该公司在**美国和加拿大拥有超过16000家门店**的**Family Dollar品牌商店**一直面临挑战。作为应对这些困境的措施，美元树已宣布未来几年将关闭970家Family Dollar门店。

战略审查过程包括评估每个独立标志可能对不同所有者具有不同的吸引力。目前的结果仍不确定。出售将标志着美元树的逆转，该企业此前曾以2美元的价格收购了Family Dollar，主要位于城市和农村贫困地区。

美元树的**美元树品牌商店**已通过将大多数商品的价格从1美元上调至1.25美元以及推出“更多选择”计划（提供更高价格点的某些产品）来适应通货膨胀。这种多价策略旨在增量添加新商品，而不是提高现有商品的成本。

在5月4日结束的一季度中，美元树的同店净销售额同比增长了1.7%，而Family Dollar仅增长了0.1%。总净销售额上升4.2%至76亿美元，净利润小幅上涨0.4%至3亿万美元。

尽管对Family Dollar未来进行了审查，但美元树继续扩大其同名商店，并计划在今年财务年度开设600至650家新门店。美元树的股价在午间交易中下跌近5%，报114.41美元，市值约为250亿美元。

 **Dollar Tree** considers selling its struggling **Family Dollar discount stores** as part of a strategic review process. This potential sale would reverse an acquisition made almost a decade ago for $8.n5 billion, which was initially driven by pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz.

The company's **Family Dollar-branded stores** have been facing challenges, accounting for nearly half of the more than 16,000 stores in the US and Canada. In response to these struggles, Dollar Tree has announced plans to close a total of 970 Family Dollar stores over the next few years.

The strategic review process includes evaluating how each separate banner might appeal differently to different sets of owners. The outcome remains uncertain at this time. A sale would mark a reversal for Dollar Tree, which had previously acquired Family Dollar in 2 grocery items and located primarily in poorer urban and rural areas.

Dollar Tree's **Dollar Tree-branded stores** have adapted to inflation by raising prices on most items from $1 to $1.25 and introducing a "More Choices" program that offers certain products at even higher price points. This multi-price strategy is aimed at adding new items incrementally, rather than increasing the cost of existing ones.

In the quarter ending May 4, Dollar Tree reported a year-on-year increase in same-store net sales by 1.7% for its namesake stores and only 0.1% for Family Dollar. Total net sales rose to $7.6 billion (up 4.2%) while net income increased slightly by 0.4% to $300.1 million.

Despite the review of Family Dollar's future, Dollar Tree continues to expand its namesake stores and plans to open between 600 and 650 new locations in this financial year. Shares in Dollar Tree were down almost 5% at $114.41 during lunchtime trading, valuing the group at about $25 billion.
