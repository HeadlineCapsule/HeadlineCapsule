评级机构给违约房产融资债券打高分

# 评级机构因给单贷款债券市场的商业房地产债务分配高评级（包括投资级最高评级 AAA）而受到批评。即使借款人违约或拖欠抵押贷款，这些债券仍维持 AAA 评级。文章强调了对误评交易的担忧，并将其与导致金融危机的问题进行比较。

## 要点：

1. 评级机构被指控在单贷款债券市场中给商业房地产债务分配高投资级评级（AAA），即使借款人违约或拖欠抵押贷款。

2. 本文提及一个具体案例：百老汇1407号3.5亿美元的债券交易，其中超过一半被评为 AAA 级，该交易只由一栋楼的支持，并因自7月以来未支付而面临清算。

3. 批评人士认为，单一资产交易缺乏多样化，使其评级不如其他债券可靠。联邦储备委员会拒绝接受此类 CMBS 债券作为新冠时代紧急贷款设施的短期贷款抵押品。

4. 已经创建了一个名为“脏十二”的债券交易列表，这些交易最初被评为 AAA 级或仍然保持该评级，尽管借款人拖欠或违约抵押贷款付款。

5. 本文建议评级机构应对该资产类别中的误评债券负责，并呼吁加强对这些交易的监督，以防止未来的金融危机。

 **Article Summary:**  
Rating agencies face criticism for assigning high marks, including top investment-grade ratings (AAA), to commercial real estate debt in the single-loan bond market. Despite borrowers being in default or delinquency on their mortgages, these bonds maintain AAA ratings. The article highlights concerns about mis-rated deals and compares them with issues leading up to the financial crisis.

**Key Points:**  
1. Rating agencies have been accused of assigning high investment-grade ratings (AAA) to commercial real estate debt in single-loan bond market, even when borrowers are defaulting or delinquent on their mortgages.
2. The article mentions a specific case: 1407 Broadway's $350mn bond deal, more than half of which was rated AAA, is backed by the fortunes of one building alone and faces foreclosure due to non-payment since July.
3. Critics argue that single-asset deals lack diversification, making their ratings less trustworthy compared to other bonds. The Federal Reserve refused to accept such CMBS bonds as collateral for short-term loans in a Covid-era emergency lending facility.
4. A list of "Dirty Dozen" bond deals has been created, which were either initially rated AAA or still are despite the borrower being delinquent or defaulting on their mortgage payments.
5. The article suggests that rating agencies should take responsibility for mis-rated bonds in this asset class and calls for more scrutiny of these deals to prevent future financial crises.
