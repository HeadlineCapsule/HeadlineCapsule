# *美国**培育肉* 禁令备受批评，被视为文化战争中的“乌龙球” 

---

**实验室培育的肉类**（又称培育肉）在美国面临法律挑战，共和党立法者近期采取行动禁止其生产和销售。 这令人感到意外，因为美国一直处于开发该技术的前沿，无论是通过公共部门的研究还是私营部门的投资。批评人士强调了由此可能带来的经济和 **竞争优势** 被让渡给亚洲的问题，这一情况类似于半导体行业的发展历程。澳大利亚初创公司 Vow 的 CEO 乔治·佩普（George Peppou）称这些努力是一个 "乌龙球"，将在另一个对国家安全和经济增长至关重要的关键技术领域使美国处于不利地位。Vow 是少数几家获得批准的 **培育肉** 产品公司之一。

争议的核心是，人们认为禁止 **实验室培育肉类** 是一种政治动机的行为，这是共和党人在选举前创造文化战争的手段，而不是出于对安全问题的合法关注。 Vow 在新加坡获准销售培养的日本鹌鹑肉——2020 年，新加坡成为第一个允许销售培养肉类的国家——这突显了这些产品的全球接受度和市场潜力日益增加。作为满足蛋白质需求日益增长同时减少传统畜牧业环境影响的一种方式，这种新兴行业极具发展前景。目前，传统的牲畜养殖业造成了约六分之一的全球温室气体排放量。

佩普强调，禁令违反了共和党一贯倡导的自由市场经济原则，并有可能重蹈半导体领域的覆辙——政策决策导致美国将技术优势让渡给亚洲。新加坡和其他亚洲国家正积极拥抱 **培养蛋白质** 替代品作为粮食安全战略，这可能会使美国在这个关键的技术部门再次落后于人。这一批评凸显了立法行动可能带来的经济和战略后果，突显出政治、经济和技术之间错综复杂的关系如何塑造着全球产业格局。

# **US** lab-grown meat bans criticised as culture war ‘own goal' 

---

 **Lab-grown meat**, also known as cultivated meat, is facing legal challenges in the United States with recent moves by Republican lawmakers to ban its production and sale. This comes as a surprise given that the US has been at the forefront of developing this technology through public sector research and private investment. The criticism highlights the potential economic and **competitive advantages** being ceded to Asia, similar to what happened with semiconductors. George Peppou, CEO of Australian startup Vow, one of the few companies with approved lab-grown meat products, calls these efforts an "own goal" that will put the US at a disadvantage in yet another key technological area critical for national security and economic growth.

The controversy centers around the argument that banning **lab-grown meat** is a politically motivated move by Republicans to create a culture war ahead of the elections, rather than being based on legitimate safety concerns. Vow's approval to sell cultured Japanese quail meat in Singapore, which became the first country to allow its sale in 2020, highlights the growing global acceptance and market potential for these products as a way to meet increasing protein demand while reducing the environmental impact of traditional livestock farming, currently responsible for about one-sixth of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Peppou emphasizes that the ban is contrary to free-market economics traditionally championed by Republicans and risks repeating the mistake made with semiconductors where policy decisions ceded US technological advantage to Asia. Singapore and other Asian countries are actively embracing cultivated protein alternatives as a food security strategy, which could leave the US lagging behind in yet another critical technology sector. This criticism underscores the potential economic and strategic consequences of these legislative moves, highlighting the complex interplay between politics, economics, and technology in shaping global industries.
