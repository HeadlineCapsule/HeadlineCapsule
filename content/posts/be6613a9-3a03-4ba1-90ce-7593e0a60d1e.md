# 减少会议，多写备忘：异步工作的未来

**异步工作**（asynchronous working），即员工自行设定工作时间并独立于彼此地工作，正成为一种越来越流行的模式。这种方法优先考虑 **详细记录** 和使用在线工具进行协作，而不是传统的会议。GitHub和Atlassian等公司已经成功采用了这种风格，但这需要管理层和员工在思想和习惯上做出改变。

随着远程工作在疫情后的工作方式中成为主流，传统的朝九晚五的工作安排正被更灵活的安排所取代。这导致了异步工作的出现，同事们的时间安排重叠得越来越少。为了使这种模式有效，公司依靠备忘录、教学视频和共享在线工作空间中的协作文档等工具，这些都可以随时访问。

异步工作的一个关键好处是它能让员工 **直接获取** 他们需要的信息，而不需要不断地开会或监督。这也使组织能够精简管理层，因为许多传统的管理任务变得多余。然而，由于高管和员工的抵制，向这种工作方式的转变可能很困难，一些人很难适应新的记录习惯。

异步工作的倡导者强调，它不会完全消除个人沟通或现场会议，而是在发生时使这些互动更有意义。为了促进团队精神和联系，采用异步工作模式的组织通常安排虚拟 "喝咖啡聊天"，并在电话中留出时间进行非正式交谈，以模仿面对面办公室的社会方面。

尽管存在挑战，但Atlassian和Scoop等公司证实了这种模式的成功，据Scoop报道，32%的美国总部企业不需要员工到办公室上班，基本上采用了异步工作模式。由于编码工作的性质，这一转变在科技公司尤为显著，但也因为它符合科技工作者已经熟悉的在线流程。

为了支持这种过渡，Notion和Atlassian等公司开发了工具，使同事能够创建内部参考资料、分派任务、监控项目并远程协同工作。Slite是一个文档管理平台，也是另一个例子，1500家公司使用它来通过高效的记录和信息检索促进异步工作。

总之，随着 **异步工作** 越来越受欢迎，未来的工作可能会减少会议，更加注重全面的记录。虽然这种模式在灵活性和效率方面带来了好处，但也带来了挑战，组织必须仔细应对，以确保成功实施并获得员工的接受。

# Fewer meetings, more memos: the future of asynchronous work 

**Asynchronous working**, which involves employees setting their own hours and working independently from one another, is becoming an increasingly popular model. This approach prioritizes **detailed documentation** and the use of online tools over traditional meetings for collaboration. Companies like GitHub and Atlassian have embraced this style with success, but it requires a shift in mindset and habits for both management and employees.

The traditional 9-5 work schedule is being replaced by more flexible arrangements as **remote work** becomes the norm post-pandemic. This has led to the emergence of asynchronous working, where colleagues' schedules overlap less frequently. To make this model effective, companies are relying on tools like memos, instructional videos, and collaborative documents in shared online workspaces that can be accessed at any time. 

A key benefit of asynchronous work is that it empowers employees to have **direct access** to the information they need without constant meetings or supervision. This also allows organizations to streamline their management layer as many traditional managerial tasks become redundant. However, the transition to this style of working can be challenging due to resistance from executives and employees alike, with some struggling to adapt to new documentation habits. 

Proponents of asynchronous work stress that it does not eliminate personal communication or live meetings altogether but rather makes these interactions more meaningful when they do occur. To foster team spirit and connection, asynchronous organizations often schedule virtual "coffee chats" and dedicate time for casual conversations during calls, emulating the social aspects of in-person offices. 

Despite the challenges, companies like Atlassian and Scoop attest to the success of this model, with Scoop reporting that 32% of US-headquartered businesses require no office time from their employees, largely adopting asynchronous work patterns. This shift is particularly prominent in tech firms due to the nature of coding work but also because it aligns with online processes already familiar to tech workers. 

To support this transition, companies like Notion and Atlassian have developed tools that enable colleagues to create internal reference materials, delegate tasks, monitor projects, and collaborate remotely. Slite, a document management platform, is another example used by 1500 companies to facilitate asynchronous work through efficient documentation and information retrieval. 

In conclusion, the future of work may involve fewer meetings and more emphasis on comprehensive documentation as asynchronous working gains traction. While this model offers benefits in terms of flexibility and efficiency, it also presents challenges that organizations must carefully navigate to ensure successful implementation and employee buy-in.
