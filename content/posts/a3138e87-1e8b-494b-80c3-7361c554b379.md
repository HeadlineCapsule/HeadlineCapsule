美国法院推翻了新的证券交易委员会私募基金披露规则

**美国法院推翻了证券交易委员会的新私募基金披露规则**

第五巡回上诉法院最近作出裁决，推翻了证券交易委员会（SEC）提出的旨在提高私募股权和对冲基金透明度的新的规则。法院裁定，证券交易委员会超出了其法定权限，从而使主席加里·根斯勒（Gary Gensler）最重要的改革努力之一无效。

拟议规则将要求私募基金管理人向投资者提供详细的季度业绩和费用报告，同时限制有利于某些投资者的秘密侧面交易。证券交易委员会认为，2008年危机后的改革赋予他们监管私募基金的广泛权力，但法院不同意这一观点。

该裁决是根斯勒改革议程的一大挫折，也引发了人们对该委员会实施其他规则权力的质疑。证券交易委员会表示，他们正在审查此裁决后的下一步行动。

包括管理资金协会和美国投资理事会在内的私募基金行业团体庆祝法院的裁决，认为这是市场、基金管理人和投资者的胜利。他们认为，拟议的改革对一个价值27万亿美元的行业造成了不必要的限制，该行业为养老基金、大学和富人提供服务。

证券交易委员会可能会向美国最高法院提出上诉；然而，他们将面临一个以限制行政机构权力而闻名保守多数的挑战。这一裁决可能对与其他拟议规则有关投资基金资产保护、外包和预测性分析使用产生影响。

 **New SEC Private Fund Disclosure Rules Thrown Out by US Court**

A recent decision from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned new rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that aimed to increase transparency within private equity and hedge funds. The court ruled that the SEC had exceeded its statutory authority, invalidating one of Chair Gary Gensler's most significant reform efforts.

The proposed rules would have required private fund managers to provide investors with detailed quarterly performance and expense reports while limiting secret side deals favoring certain investors. The SEC argued that post-2008 crisis reforms had granted them broad powers to regulate private funds, but the court disagreed.

The ruling is a major setback for Gensler's reform agenda and raises questions about the commission's power to impose other rules it has been working on. The SEC stated that they are reviewing their next steps after this decision.

Private fund industry groups, including the Managed Funds Association and American Investment Council, celebrated the court's ruling as a victory for markets, fund managers, and investors. They argued that the proposed reforms imposed unnecessary constraints on an industry worth $27 trillion serving pension funds, universities, and wealthy individuals.

The SEC may appeal to the US Supreme Court; however, they would face a conservative majority known for limiting administrative agencies' authority. This ruling could have implications for other proposed rules related to investment fund asset safeguarding, outsourcing, and predictive analytics use.
