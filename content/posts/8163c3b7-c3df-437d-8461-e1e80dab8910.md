# 工党 的“平淡红利”可能有多大？

**工党对稳定性的承诺及其经济影响**

这篇文章探讨了工党承诺为英国商业环境带来确定性和稳定性所可能带来的经济利益，这一承诺被称为“**平淡红利**”。该党承诺减少政策不确定性，预计将促进投资和增长，尤其是在之前的 **英国脱欧** 担忧和利兹·特拉斯短暂首相任期的影响的背景下。

这篇文章强调了关于政策不确定性对外国直接投资和商业信心产生负面影响的传闻性证据和系统性证据。它还介绍了各种不确定性衡量标准，包括 **英国经济政策不确定性（EPU）指数**，该指数在最近的几次政治事件中出现了明显的峰值。

影子财政大臣 Rachel Reeves 对财政稳定性的承诺包括她做出的年度预算单一承诺、一致的财政规则以及商业税收路线图。然后，文章试图量化减少不确定性可能产生的影响，认为 EPU 指数的下降可能导致工业生产增加，并进而推动 GDP 增长。

然而，文章也承认经济数据中建立 **因果关系** 的挑战，并讨论了 “平淡红利” 被高估或低估的可能性。文章的结论强调了经济预测中固有的不确定性，同时也强调了工党稳定性承诺的潜在益处。

总的来说，这篇文章对工党确定性承诺所带来的潜在经济收益进行了细致入微的探讨，凸显了政策、商业信心和经济结果之间复杂的相互作用。

# How large might Labour’s 'dullness dividend' be? 

**Labour's Promise of Stability and Its Economic Impact**

The article explores the potential economic benefits of Labour's pledge to bring certainty and stability to the UK's business environment, dubbed the "dullness dividend." The party's promise to reduce policy uncertainty is expected to boost investment and growth, particularly in the context of previous concerns about **Brexit** and the impact of Liz Truss's short-lived premiership. 

The piece highlights both anecdotal and systematic evidence of the negative effects of policy uncertainty on foreign direct investment and business confidence. It also introduces various measures of uncertainty, including the **UK's Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index**, which has shown notable spikes around recent political events. 

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves's commitment to fiscal stability is outlined, including her promise of a single annual budget, consistent fiscal rules, and a roadmap for business taxation. The article then attempts to quantify the potential impact of reduced uncertainty, suggesting that a fall in the EPU index could lead to increased industrial production and, by extension, a boost to GDP. 

However, the challenges of establishing **causal relationships** in economic data are acknowledged, and the potential for over- or underestimation of the "dullness dividend" is discussed. The article concludes by emphasizing the uncertainty inherent in economic predictions, even as it underscores the potential benefits of Labour's stability pledge. 

Overall, the piece presents a nuanced exploration of the potential economic gains from Labour's promise of certainty, highlighting the complex interplay between policy, business confidence, and economic outcomes.
