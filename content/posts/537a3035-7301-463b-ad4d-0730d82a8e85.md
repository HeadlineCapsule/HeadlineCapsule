# 雪佛龙-赫斯 530 亿美元交易遭遇打击，投资者被建议弃权

**代理顾问机构** Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) 建议赫斯公司股东对雪佛龙拟议的 530 亿美元收购案弃权，理由是赫斯公司与埃克森美孚在圭亚那石油权益方面存在争议，带来了不确定性。该交易将使雪佛龙获得赫斯在圭亚那海上油田的**可获利股份**，但由于埃克森美孚声称对同一资产拥有**优先购买权**，交易面临复杂情况。由于仲裁过程可能持续到 2025 年，ISS 建议赫斯股东等待结果明朗后再做决定。顾问还建议雪佛龙向赫斯股东提供激励措施，以弥补可能的延迟或交易破裂带来的损失。与此同时，该交易还面临政治反对和联邦贸易委员会调查，美国参议院多数党领袖查克·舒默担心它会影响汽油价格。

# Blow to $53bn Chevron-Hess Deal as Investors Advised to Abstain 

**Proxy adviser** Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that shareholders of Hess abstain from voting on the proposed $53 billion takeover by Chevron, citing a dispute with ExxonMobil over oil rights in Guyana as a source of uncertainty. The deal, which would give Chevron access to Hess's lucrative stake in an offshore oil block in Guyana, is facing complications due to ExxonMobil's claim of a **right of first refusal** on the same assets. With the arbitration process potentially extending until 2025, ISS advises Hess shareholders to pause and await more clarity on the outcome. The adviser also suggests that Chevron could offer an incentive to Hess shareholders to compensate for potential delays or a broken deal. This recommendation comes as the deal also faces political opposition and an FTC investigation, with US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer expressing concerns about its potential impact on petrol prices.
