淡马锡风投公司将推出首只专注于日本的基金

# 新加坡Vertex Holdings进军日本初创企业领域


**新加坡**的风险投资(**VC**)巨头**Vertex Holdings（维萨基金）**宣布推出其首支专注于 **日本初创企业** 的基金。Vertex Holdings 是淡马锡控股公司的全资子公司，计划在日本筹集100亿日元(约6500万美元)的资金，主要投资于消费者及企业**软件**和 **"深科技 "**领域的早期创业公司。此举正值日本政府大力推动政策改革以促进初创企业生态系统发展并吸引全球投资者之际。Vertex以其在该地区的成功投资而闻名，其中包括 Grab（格拉布），并且拥有专注于不同地区和行业的基金网络。这家日本新基金将使 Vertex 能够发掘当地的投资机会并将日本初创公司介绍其全球网络。


### **问题一：维萨基金(Vertex)进入日本市场为何意义重大?** 

答：由于日本的创业生态系统落后于中国和新加坡等其他亚洲国家，全球领先的风险投资机构向日本初创企业注入资金的传统较少。尽管日本是世界主要经济体之一，但维萨基金（Vertex）推出专属基金的举措是一种独特的战略，可能会鼓励更多的国际风投公司考虑投资于日本初创企业。

### **问题二：日本初创企业生态系统有哪些挑战和机遇?** 

答：与其他国家相比，日本独角兽企业较少的原因是年轻公司往往因大型创业公司可获得的私人资本有限而较早上市。然而，日本政府最近通过放宽外国投资者和企业家居留规则等改革措施来促进初创企业投资，为维萨基金（Vertex）这样的风险投资公司提供了吸引人的机会，使其能够进入一个具有强大潜力的市场。

### **问题三：维萨基金(Vertex)将如何利用其日本新基金?** 

答：该基金将专注于至少向15家消费者及企业软件以及深科技行业的早期创业公司进行投资。作为基石投资者，Vertex可以为当地初创企业提供资金，同时将其引入全球基金和专家网络，帮助日本企业拓展国际业务并获取更多的发展机会。

Here is a summary of the article:

**Singapore's** **Vertex Holdings**, the venture capital (**VC**) arm of **Temasek Holdings**, is launching its first dedicated fund for **Japanese start-ups**. With a target raise of ¥10 billion ($65 million), Vertex aims to invest in early-stage companies, particularly in consumer and enterprise **software** and "**deep tech**" fields. This move comes as Japan seeks to boost its start-up ecosystem and attract global investors, with support from the government through policy reforms. Vertex is known for its successful investments in the region, including Grab, and has a strong network of funds focused on various regions and sectors. The new Japan fund will allow Vertex to tap into local investment opportunities and connect Japanese start-ups with its global network.

**Bolded** words are key terms or concepts that may require further explanation for a full understanding of the article's content. 

Now, here are three interesting questions based on the article: 

1. Q: Why is Vertex's move into Japan considered rare and significant? 
A: Venture capital investments in Japan by leading global investors have traditionally been scarce due to the country's start-up ecosystem lagging behind other Asian countries like China and Singapore. This is despite Japan being one of the world's largest economies, which makes Vertex's dedicated fund a unique strategy that could encourage more international VC firms to consider investing in Japanese start-ups. 

2. Q: What are the challenges and opportunities presented by the Japanese start-up ecosystem? 
A: Japan has had fewer unicorns compared to other countries because young companies tend to go public earlier due to limited private capital available for larger start-ups. However, the Japanese government's recent efforts to boost start-up investments and reforms, such as relaxing residency rules for foreign investors and entrepreneurs, present attractive opportunities for VC firms like Vertex to tap into a market with strong potential. 

3. Q: How does Vertex plan to utilize its new Japan fund? 
A: The fund will focus on investing in at least 15 early-stage companies across consumer and enterprise software, as well as deep tech sectors. By being the anchor investor, Vertex can provide capital to local start-ups while also connecting them to its global network of funds and experts, helping Japanese businesses expand internationally and access a wider range of opportunities than they might otherwise have access to. 

These questions and answers provide additional context and insights into the article's subject matter, highlighting the significance of Vertex's move into Japan and the potential impact on the country's start-up ecosystem.
