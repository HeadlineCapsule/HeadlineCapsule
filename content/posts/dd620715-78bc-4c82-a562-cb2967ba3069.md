# 工党承诺就英国工人权利问题咨询企业

**工党“劳动人民新政”** 已经过修订，该党承诺将与企业和其他团体就其改善英国工人权利的计划进行“充分而全面的”**磋商**。此次磋商的目的是制定相关政策，供该党候选人开展竞选活动，并解决**商业团体**提出的问题。新文本包括一些变化，如允许对新员工进行**试用期**，以及赋予员工**签订合同的权利**，以反映常规工作模式，而不是直接禁止“**零时工合同**”。工党还软化了其对“**下班权**”的立场，现在承诺将基于其他国家的模式采取更**灵活的做法**。尽管一些工会人士对修订表示失望，但工党坚称“新政”变化不大，该党仍致力于在当选后立即实施这些提议。

# Labour promises to consult business on UK workers’ rights

**Labour Party's "New Deal for Working People"** has been revised, with the party pledging a "full and comprehensive" **consultation with businesses and other groups** on their plans to improve workers' rights in the UK. This consultation is an effort to create policies that their candidates can campaign on, and to address concerns raised by **business groups**. The new text includes changes such as allowing **probationary periods** for new staff and a **right to a contract** reflecting regular work patterns instead of an outright ban on **zero-hour contracts**. Labour has also softened its stance on the "right to switch off", now promising a more **flexible approach** based on models from other countries. While some union figures have expressed disappointment with the revisions, Labour maintains that there have been minimal changes to the New Deal and that they remain committed to hitting the ground running with these proposals if elected.
