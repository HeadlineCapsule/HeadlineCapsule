政治信念：乔·拜登在特朗普有罪判决中看到机会

**政治判罪：乔·拜登看到了特朗普有罪判决的机会**

这篇文章讨论了**民主党**如何看到机会，让他们的候选人**乔·拜登**利用前总统唐纳德·特朗普最近的有罪判决。民主党人认为，强调特朗普作为罪犯的身份可能会帮助他们赢得选民的支持，并有可能影响即将到来的选举中的未决定选民。

文章强调了乔·拜登连任竞选活动对唐纳德·特朗普的攻击越来越激烈，他们的最新备忘录称他为“被定罪的重犯”。民主党敦促总统拜登利用这一判决作为对抗共和党对手的选举武器。

一些民主党策略师呼吁该党和乔·拜登的竞选团队更积极地针对特朗普作为第一位被判犯有罪行的前总统的身份。他们认为，民主党不应回避在他们的候选人与特朗普之间画出鲜明对比，尤其是考虑到这个故事对选举结果的潜在影响。

最近的一次路透社/益普索民意调查表明，由于特朗普的定罪，10%的共和党选民和25%的独立选民不太可能投票给特朗普。然而，特朗普的民意调查专家对这一判决对前总统在即将举行的选举中获胜机会的影响表示争议。

文章还指出，虽然一些民主党人认为利用特朗普有罪判决是必要的，但其他人认为，专注于他的罪行而不解决美国人面临的其他关键问题可能并不明智。

总之，乔·拜登和民主党正在考虑将唐纳德·特朗普最近的定罪作为他们竞选策略的政治武器。这种方法的效果尚不确定，但它可能会影响那些由于特朗普作为罪犯的身份而感到失望的选民。

**问题：**
1. 民主党如何计划在他们的竞选战略中使用唐纳德·特朗普的有罪判决？
2. 在选举活动中关注特朗普定罪有哪些潜在风险和益处？
3. 根据路透社/益普索民调，多少共和党选民和独立选民因特朗普的判决而不太可能投票给他？
4. 不同的民主党策略师如何看待在他们的竞选战略中利用特朗普定罪的重要性？

**Conviction Politics: Joe Biden Sees Opportunity in Trump's Guilty Verdict**

The article discusses how the **Democratic Party** sees an opportunity for their candidate, **Joe Biden**, to capitalize on former President Donald Trump's recent guilty verdict. The Democrats believe that emphasizing Trump's status as a felon could help them win over voters and potentially sway undecided ones in the upcoming election.

The article highlights how Joe Biden's re-election campaign has been escalating its attacks on Donald Trump, with their latest memo labeling him as a "convicted felon." The Democrats are urging President Biden to use this verdict as an electoral weapon against his Republican rival.

Some Democratic strategists have called for the party and Joe Biden's campaign to be more aggressive in targeting Trump over his status as the first former president found guilty of a crime. They argue that Democrats should not shy away from drawing sharp contrasts between their candidate and Trump, especially given the potential impact this story could have on the election outcome.

A recent Reuter/Ipsos poll indicates that 10% of Republican voters and 25% of independent voters are less likely to vote for Trump due to his conviction. However, a pollster for Trump disputes any significant impact from this verdict on the former president's chances in the upcoming election.

The article also notes that while some Democrats believe capitalizing on Trump's guilty verdict is essential, others argue it may not be wise to focus too much attention on his crimes at the expense of addressing other critical issues facing Americans.

In conclusion, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are considering using Donald Trump's recent conviction as a political weapon in their campaign strategy. The effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain, but it could potentially sway voters who may be disillusioned with Trump due to his status as a felon.

**Questions:**
1. How do the Democrats plan on using Donald Trump's guilty verdict in their campaign strategy?
2. What are some potential risks and benefits of focusing on Trump's conviction during the election campaign?
3. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, what percentage of Republican voters and independent voters may be less likely to vote for Trump due to his verdict?
4. How do different Democratic strategists view the importance of capitalizing on Trump's conviction in their campaign strategy?
