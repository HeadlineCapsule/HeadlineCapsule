# GSK 出售剩余的 Haleon 股份 

**GSK**（葛兰素史克），一家知名的英国制药公司，已宣布决定出售其剩余 **4.2%** 的股份在 **Haleon**（惠氏）这家消费医疗保健公司，它于 **2022 年 7 月** 分拆了这家公司。此举预计将为 GSK 带来约 **10 亿英镑**的收入，标志着这家止痛药 **Panadol**（潘生）和牙膏 **Sensodyne**（佳洁士）制造商的彻底退出。 

出售 Haleon 股份是制药集团更广泛的战略的一部分，旨在精简其业务并专注于开发高价值药品。在过去的一年里，GSK 逐渐减持了其在 Haleon 的股份，在 2023 年 5 月持有该公司 **12.9%** 的股份。预计总股本处置将筹集近 **40 亿英镑**，为减少债务或兼并和收购提供大量资金。 

Pfizer（辉瑞）和 GSK 消费者健康资产在 2019 年成立了 Haleon 这家合资企业，这是对股东压力的回应，尤其是来自激进投资者 **Elliott Advisors**（艾略特顾问）的压力。最初保留了 **Haleon** **32%** 股份的辉瑞也一直在逐步减少其持股，并打算最终退出该公司。 

GSK 在周四市场收盘后宣布，将通过 **加速簿记建档要约流程** 来确定报价，该流程将立即开始。此次最终出售凸显了制药企业不断变化的优先事项，即专注于开发价格更高的新药品，并摆脱盈利能力较弱的部门。

# GSK sells off remaining stake in Haleon 

**GSK**, a prominent British pharmaceutical company, has announced its decision to sell its remaining **4.2 percent** stake in **Haleon**, the consumer healthcare company it spun off in **July 2022**. This move is expected to generate approximately **£1 billion** for GSK, marking a complete departure from the maker of **Panadol** painkillers and **Sensodyne** toothpaste. 

/n/n

The sale of the **Haleon** shares is part of a broader strategy by pharmaceutical groups to streamline their operations and concentrate on the development of high-value medicines. Over the last year, GSK has gradually reduced its stake in **Haleon**, having held **12.9 percent** of the company's shares in May 2023. The total stock disposals are anticipated to raise nearly **£4 billion**, providing significant capital for debt reduction or mergers and acquisitions. 

/n/n

The formation of **Haleon** in 2019 as a joint venture between **Pfizer** and GSK's consumer health assets was a response to shareholder pressure, particularly from activist investor **Elliott Advisors**. **Pfizer**, which initially retained a **32 percent** stake in **Haleon**, has also been gradually reducing its position and intends to eventually exit the company. 

/n/n

**GSK's** announcement, made after the market close on Thursday, indicated that the offer price would be determined through an **accelerated bookbuild offering process** that would commence immediately. This final sale underscores the shifting priorities of pharmaceutical businesses, which are now focused on developing new medicines with high price points and moving away from lower-earning divisions.
