格鲁吉亚军采纳俄罗斯式的“外国代理人”法

# 摘要：

格鲁吉亚议会通过了“外国代理人”法，尽管布鲁塞尔方面提出了警告，并且发生了街头抗议。该法案规定，获得国外资金的公民权利团体和媒体机构必须向政府注册为“外国代理人”，否则将面临罚款。批评者认为，这一法案受到俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京镇压非政府组织和独立媒体的启发。格鲁吉亚议会的大多数现任议员投票赞成该法案，而反对派议员则离开会议加入抗议该法案的示威者行列。欧洲委员会对这一决定表示深感遗憾，称这将负面影响格鲁吉亚加入欧盟的道路。

# 问题：

1. **问题：在格鲁吉亚通过“外国代理人”法有什么潜在后果？**
   *答案：*通过“外国代理人”法可能会对格鲁吉亚产生多种负面影响，包括损害其加入欧盟的努力，并导致与西方首都的关系紧张。它也可能导致美国等国的制裁，并影响依赖免签前往欧盟的亲欧格鲁吉亚人。

2. **问题：这一法律与其他国家（如俄罗斯）的类似法律相比如何？**
   *答案：*据称，格鲁吉亚的“外国代理人”法受到俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京镇压非政府组织和独立媒体的启发。在两种情况下，法律都要求获得国外资金的公民权利团体和媒体机构向政府注册为“外国代理人”，否则将面临处罚。

3. **问题：在这种背景下，格鲁吉亚与俄罗斯的关系意义何在？**
   *答案：*通过“外国代理人”法可能标志着格鲁吉亚外交政策的转变，使其更加接近俄罗斯，而不是长期以来对欧盟一体化的承诺。这可能会影响格鲁吉亚的国内政治局势以及与西方国家的国际关系，这些国家支持其亲欧立场。

**Summary:**
Georgia's parliament has adopted a "foreign agents" law, despite warnings from Brussels and street protests. The bill mandates that civil rights groups and media outlets receiving funds from abroad must register with the government as “foreign agents” or face fines. Critics say it was inspired by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on non-governmental organizations and independent media. A majority of cuurent MPs in Georgia's parliament voted in favor, while opposition lawmakers left to join demonstrators outside protesting the bill. The European Commission expressed deep regret over this decision, stating it would negatively impact Georgia’s EU path.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. **Q: What are the potential consequences of adopting a "foreign agents" law in Georgia?**
   A: The adoption of the "foreign agents" law could have several negative consequences for Georgia, including jeopardizing its EU accession drive and straining relations with western capitals. It may also lead to sanctions from countries like the US and impact pro-European Georgians who rely on visa-free travel to the bloc.
   
2. **Q: How does this law compare to similar laws in other countries, such as Russia?**
   A: The "foreign agents" law in Georgia is said to be inspired by Russian President Vladimir Putin's crackdown on non-governmental organizations and independent media. In both cases, the laws require civil rights groups and media outlets receiving funds from abroad to register with the government as “foreign agents” or face penalties.
   
3. **Q: What is the significance of Georgia's relationship with Russia in this context?**
   A: The adoption of the "foreign agents" law may signal a shift in Georgia's foreign policy, moving it closer to Russia and away from its longstanding commitment to EU integration. This could have implications for Georgia's domestic political situation as well as its international relations with western countries that support its pro-European stance.
