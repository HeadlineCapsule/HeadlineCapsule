英美资源集团在拒绝了提高后的竞标后，延长了对必和必拓收购的最后期限。

## 摘要：
**英国上市公司英美集团**（Anglo American）再次延长了其竞争对手 **必和必拓集团**（BHP Group，澳大利亚公司）的收购报价期限。在第三次且是“最终”提议中，必和必拓提高了股票竞标价格后，现在可以将正式提案的截止时间延长至英国时间5月29日下午5点。尽管英美集团董事会因交易结构复杂、涉及剥离两家南非子公司而拒绝了这一最新报价，但表示愿意在未来一周内继续与必和必拓进行讨论。

此次拟议中的收购行动如果成功将会是采矿业的历史性事件，并可能通过给予必和必拓对更多铜资源的掌控权来改变全球行业格局——这些铜资源对于脱碳工作至关重要。然而，英美集团对其交易结构及其对股东的潜在影响表达了严重担忧。根据4月23日的收盘价，最新的提案将英美集团股票估值为每股29.34英镑，溢价达到兼并谈判前水平的47%。

## 一些有趣的问题：
**Q1: 如果这次收购成功，对两家公司分别会有什么利弊？**  
A1: 对必和必拓集团来说，成功收购英美集团将为其带来更多对于脱碳工作至关重要的铜资源掌控权。这可能会显著提升他们在全球采矿业中的地位。此外，英美集团的股东们将会获得必和必拓17.8%的股份以及他们目前股票价值上的溢价。然而，交易结构复杂，需要剥离两家南非子公司，这也带来了一些不利因素：可能会产生实质性的完成风险并对英美集团的股东造成不成比例的影响。

**Q2: 这次收购行动会对全球采矿业产生什么影响？**  
A2: 如果必和必拓集团与英美集团合并成功，将会形成一个规模更大、业务更多元化的实体，并在铜资源供应方面具有更大的优势——而铜资源正是脱碳工作所必需的。这可能会给市场带来更多的竞争，同时也将对全球采矿业的定价策略和供应链产生影响。

**Q3: 英美集团董事会对于交易结构提出了哪些担忧？**  
A3: 英美集团董事会的担忧主要集中在这笔交易复杂的结构上：它需要剥离两家南非子公司，他们认为这可能会导致实质性的完成风险并对他们的股东造成不成比例的影响。此外，在选举年提出剥离这两家子公司的提议，也被视为必和必拓对南非投下了一张“不信任票”，这也引起了担忧。

## Summary:
In an ongoing saga, **UK-listed miner Anglo American** has extended the deadline for a takeover bid from its Australian rival, **BHP Group**. BHP now has until 5pm UK time on May amo29 to submit a formal proposal after increasing the number of shares offered in their third and "final" deal proposition. Despite rejecting this latest offer due to concerns over the complex deal structure involving spinning off two South African units, Anglo American's board remains open to further discussions with BHP for an additional week.

The proposed takeover would be a historic event in the mining sector and could potentially transform the global industry by granting BHP access to more copper resources essential for decarbonization efforts. However, Anglo American has expressed serious concerns about the deal structure and its potential impact on shareholders. The latest proposal values Anglo shares at £29.34 based on April 23 closing prices, with a premium of 47% to pre-merger talks announcement levels.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What are the potential benefits and drawbacks for both companies if this takeover bid is successful?
A1: If the takeover bid succeeds, BHP Group would gain access to more copper resources, which are vital for decarbonization efforts. This could significantly enhance their position in the global mining industry. Additionally, Anglo American shareholders would receive 17.8% of BHP's shares and a premium on their current stock value. However, drawbacks include potential complications arising from spinning off two South African units as required by the deal structure. This could result in material completion risk and disproportionate impact on Anglo American shareholders.

Q2: How might this takeover bid affect the global mining industry?
A2: The proposed merger between BHP Group and Anglo American would create a larger, more diversified entity with increased access to copper resources essential for decarbonization efforts. This could potentially lead to greater competition in the market, as well as influence pricing strategies and supply chains within the global mining industry.

Q3: What are some of the concerns raised by Anglo American's board regarding the deal structure?
A3: The primary concern for Anglo American's board is the complex deal structure that requires spinning off two South African units, which they believe could result in material completion risk and a disproportionate impact on their shareholders. Additionally, there are concerns about BHP making a "vote of no confidence" in South Africa during an election year by proposing to demerge the two units.
