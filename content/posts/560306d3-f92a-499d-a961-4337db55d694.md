洪都拉斯前总统因贩毒被判入狱45年

洪都拉斯前总统胡安·奥兰多·埃尔南德斯因**可卡因走私案**被判处**四十五年**监禁

洪都拉斯前总统因阴谋运输吨位毒品和接受卡特尔资金而被定罪。迅速的起诉向该地区领导人发出警告，强调**司法部将追究所有参与暴力毒品贩运者的责任**，无论其权力或地位如何。

埃尔南德斯于 2014 年至 2022 年领导洪都拉斯，因阴谋使用武装力量运输 400 多吨运往美国的可卡因而定罪。据检察官称，他涉嫌收受了数百万美金的贿赂，以资助他的政治野心。

前总统一直坚持自己无罪，并在审判中指出了他监督的引渡案作为证据。对埃尔南德斯的指控过程异常迅速：他在离任几周后被捕，并在两年半内被判刑，而墨西哥前安全部长杰纳罗·加西亚·卢纳因毒品贩运罪则延迟了判决。

埃尔南德斯在其任期内采取了严厉打击犯罪的政策，监督了世界最高谋杀率的下降。然而，谋杀率仍然很高，帮派继续运营广泛的勒索网络，威胁公民。他的继任者越来越多地采用受萨尔瓦多纳伊布·布克莱启发的政策来试图遏制暴力。

 **Honduras' former president Juan Orlando Hernández sentenced to cuarenta y cinco años** in cocaine trafficking case  

The ex-president of Honduras was convicted for conspiring to move tonnes of drugs and accepting cartel money. The swift prosecution serves as a warning to leaders across the region, emphasizing that **justice department will hold accountable all those who engage in violent drug trafficking** regardless of their power or position.

Hernández led Honduras from 2014 until 2022 and was convicted for his role in an armed conspiracy to move more than 400 tonnes of US-bound cocaine through the Central American country. He allegedly received millions of dollars in bribes that helped finance his political ambitions, according to prosecutors.

The former president has maintained his innocence and pointed to extraditions he oversaw as proof during the trial. The case against Hernández was unusually speedy: he was arrested weeks after leaving office and given a sentence less than two-and-a-half years later, compared to Mexico's former security minister Genaro García Luna's delayed sentencing for drug trafficking offences.

Hernández adopted tough-on-crime policies during his tenure, overseeing a decline in homicide rates from some of the highest in the world. However, murder rates remain elevated and gangs continue to run extensive networks of extortion that threaten citizens. His successor has increasingly turned to policies inspired by El Salvador's Nayib Bukele to try to contain the violence.
