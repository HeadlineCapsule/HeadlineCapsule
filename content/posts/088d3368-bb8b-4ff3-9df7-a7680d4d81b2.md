# **全球通胀和利率追踪器**：查看贵国如何对比

**通货膨胀** 和 **利率** 是对各国金融格局产生重大影响的动态变量。随着 **通胀压力** 在全球开始出现缓解迹象，**中央银行** 正在战略性地调整 **借贷成本** 来应对充满挑战的经济气候。

／

《金融时报》开发了一个 **全球通胀和利率追踪器**，以可视化方式呈现全球 **消费者物价通胀** 和 **中央银行政策利率**。该工具为影响政策制定者决策的因素及其对借贷成本的随后影响提供了宝贵见解。中央银行同步提高利率是对价格上涨的一个显著反应。

／

**更高的借贷成本** 在抑制疫情期间和乌克兰战争时期飙升的 **物价增长** 方面发挥了关键作用。虽然 **通货膨胀** 总体上已从其峰值下降，但 **政策制定者** 警告说，在发达经济体实现 2% 的 **通胀率** 目标可能具有挑战性。 《金融时报》的追踪器允许用户监控大多数国家的这些变量，包括 **通货膨胀率** 和 **利率**。

／

此外，该追踪器涵盖了关键指标，为潜在的通胀和政策利率变化提供了早期信号。这些指标包括 **基本价格压力**（不包括食品和能源成本）和 **批发能源价格** 等措施，它们可以预示未来的消费者价格变动。在俄罗斯-乌克兰冲突引发的能源危机期间，天然气和电力成本从其峰值回落是一个值得注意的发展。

／

该追踪器还考虑到 **两年期政府债券收益率**，它对市场对未来利率的预期变化敏感，以及 **资产价格**，特别是住房市场。在疫情期间飙升的房价已经由于抵押贷款利率上升而放缓。

／

随着全球经济在疫情后和地缘政治紧张局势中寻求发展， 《金融时报》的追踪器是一个宝贵的资源，有助于了解通货膨胀和利率之间的复杂相互作用，并洞察中央银行为稳定其经济而采用的策略。

# Global inflation and interest rates tracker: see how your country compares

**Inflation** and **interest rates** are dynamic variables that significantly impact the financial landscape of nations. As **inflationary pressures** begin to show signs of easing globally, **central banks** are strategically adjusting **borrowing costs** to navigate the challenging economic climate. 

/

The FT has developed a **global inflation and interest rates tracker**, offering a visual representation of **consumer price inflation** and **central bank policy rates** worldwide. This tool provides valuable insights into the factors influencing policymakers' decisions and the subsequent impact on borrowing costs. The synchronized increase in interest rates by central banks has been a notable response to rising prices. 

/

**Higher borrowing costs** have played a pivotal role in curbing the rapid **price growth** experienced during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. While **inflation** has generally decreased from its peak, **policymakers** caution that reaching the target **inflation rate** of 2% in advanced economies may prove challenging. The FT's tracker allows users to monitor these variables, including **inflation rates** and **interest rates**, for most countries. 

/

Additionally, the tracker covers critical indicators that provide early signals of potential shifts in inflation and policy rates. These include measures such as **underlying price pressures**, excluding food and energy costs, and **wholesale energy prices**, which can foreshadow future consumer price movements. The retreat of gas and electricity costs from their peaks during the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a notable development. 

/

The tracker also takes into account **two-year government bond yields**, sensitive to market expectations of future interest rates, and **asset prices**, particularly the housing market. Soaring home prices during the pandemic have given way to a slowdown due to rising mortgage rates. 

/

As global economies navigate the aftermath of the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, the FT's tracker serves as a valuable resource for understanding the complex interplay between inflation and interest rates, providing insights into the strategies employed by central banks to stabilize their respective economies.
