中国成为菲律宾最大的双边贷款国之一

# 中国对菲律宾的双边贷款

AidData 的一份最新报告强调，**中国**已成为菲律宾最大的双边基础设施贷款国之一，在2000年至2022年间总共承诺提供91亿美元。北京和马尼拉的金融关系根据其政治动态而波动，尤其是在南中国海争端方面。

在 **格洛丽亚·马卡帕加尔-阿罗约** 总统（2001-2010 年）任期内，中国的发展融资从8800万美元增加到9310万美元。然而，在 **贝尼尼奥·阿基诺** 总统（2010-2016 年）任期内，由于与中国的紧张关系，菲律宾收到的资金较少。在 **罗德里戈·杜特尔特** 总统（2016-2022 年）任期内，情况再次发生变化，他寻求与北京建立更紧密的联系，导致中国在过去六年里有超过三分之二的发展资金流入该国。

该报告表明，随着中国和菲律宾因南中国海争端而关系日益紧张，来自中国的贷款可能会减少或转移重点。中国提供的大部分国家指导型融资不是援助而是接近市场利率的贷款，这使得中国与其他双边贷款国（如日本和美国）相比是一个重要的贷款国。

中国贷款人一直对菲律宾政治上连接的地区表现出持续兴趣，例如达沃，在杜特尔特总统上任后，该地区见证了中国支持项目的涌入。该报告还发现，在136个受助组织中，有20个部分归属于菲律宾华人或中国人本身。

总之，**中国** 作为菲律宾的主要双边贷款国，其角色受到政治和经济因素的影响，金融承诺的波动反映了他们关系动态的变化。

 # Summary: China's Bilateral Lending to the Philippines

A recent report by AidData highlighted that **China** has emerged as one of the largest bilateral infrastructure lenders to the **Philippines**, with a total commitment of $9.1 billion between 2000 and 2022. The financial relationship between Beijing and Manila fluctuates based on their political dynamics, particularly in relation to the South China Sea disputes.

Under **President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo** (2001-2010), Chinese development finance increased from $88 million to $931 million. However, during President **Benigno Aquino's** tenure (2010-2016), the Philippines received less money due to strained relations with China. The situation changed again under President **Rodrigo Duterte** (2016-2022), who sought closer ties with Beijing, resulting in more than two-thirds of Chinese development funds flowing into the country during his six years in office.

The report suggests that as relations between China and the Philippines become increasingly contentious due to South China Sea disputes, lending from China may decrease or shift focus. The majority of state-directed finance provided by China is not aid but loans with conditions close to market rates, making it a significant bilateral lender compared to Japan and the US.

Chinese lenders have shown sustained interest in politically connected areas within the Philippines, such as Davao, which saw an influx of Chinese-backed projects after President Duterte took office. The report also found that 20 out of 136 recipient organizations were partially owned by individuals from the Filipino-Chinese diaspora or China itself.

In conclusion, **China's** role as a major bilateral lender to the Philippines is influenced by political and economic factors, with fluctuations in finance commitments reflecting changes in their relationship dynamics.
