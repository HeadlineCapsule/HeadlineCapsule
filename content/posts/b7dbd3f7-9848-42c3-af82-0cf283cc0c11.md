比利时不会在“卡塔尔门”案中起诉摩洛哥嫌疑人

# 比利时当局决定不对与欧洲议会“卡塔尔门”腐败丑闻有关联的摩洛哥嫌疑人提出指控，这标志着该于2022年开始的调查又遭遇了另一个挫折。联邦检察官办公室表示，将进一步行动的决定权留给这些个人的母国当局。

由于存在利益冲突的指控、司法审查以及调查人员的变动，对涉嫌从卡塔尔和摩洛哥收受贿赂的欧盟议员的调查面临困难。2023年4月，比利时通知摩洛哥当局，他们怀疑这些个人涉及腐败、洗钱和参与犯罪组织。

其中一名嫌疑人是阿卜德里拉赫曼·阿特穆恩，他是涉嫌参与贿赂前欧洲议会议员皮埃尔·安东尼奥·潘泽里（Pier Antonio Panzeri）的摩洛哥外交官。卡塔尔政府否认了任何不当行为，而潘泽里则承认收受了至少200万欧元来自两国用于政治利益和友好欧盟决议的贿赂。

2022年12月，布鲁塞尔警方突袭了欧洲议会办公室，没收了现金并逮捕了包括希腊议员埃娃·凯利（Eva Kaili）和潘泽里的前助理弗朗西斯科·乔吉（Francesco Giorgi）在内的数人。

由于司法审查仍在进行中且调查人员发生了变化，目前还没有人正式被起诉。审查结果尚未出炉，但参与调查的人员之间存在利益冲突的担忧已经提出。

 **Summary:**  
Belgian authorities have decided not to charge Moroccan suspects linked to the Qatargate corruption scandal within the European parliament, marking another setback for the investigation that began in 2022. The federal prosecutor's office stated it would leave any further action against the individuals up to their home country authorities.

The investigation into EU lawmakers suspected of receiving bribes from Qatar and Morocco faced difficulties due to accusations of conflicts of interest, a judicial review, and changes in investigating personnel. In April 2023, Belgium informed Moroccan authorities that they suspected the individuals of corruption, money laundering, and participating in a criminal organization.

One suspect is Abderrahim Atmoun, a Moroccan diplomat allegedly involved in bribing former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri. The Qatari government has denied any wrongdoing, while Panzeri admitted to accepting at least €2 million in bribes from both countries for political favors and friendly EU resolutions.

Brussels police raided the European parliament offices in December 2022, seizing cash and arresting several individuals, including Eva Kaili, a Greek MEP who had previously served as vice-president of the parliament, and Francesco Giorgi, Panzeri's former assistant.

No one has been formally charged yet due to ongoing judicial reviews and changes in investigating personnel. The outcome of the review is still pending, with concerns raised over conflicts of interest among those involved in the investigation.
