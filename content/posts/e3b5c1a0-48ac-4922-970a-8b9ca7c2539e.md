美国零售商削减价格，因消费者表现出对通货膨胀感到疲劳的迹象

# 美国零售商转变策略，降价以适应消费者“通胀疲劳”

**美国零售商** **Target** 和 **Walmart** 正在引领行业变革，通过降低数千种商品的价格来适应多年来的高通胀。随着消费者表现出 "**通胀疲劳**"，此举应运而生——根据《金融时报》-密歇根罗斯（FT-Michigan Ross）的一项民意调查，71% 的美国人对经济状况持负面看法。Target 和 Walmart 通过降价保持竞争力，吸引注重预算的购物者。像 Lowe's 和 Macy's 这样的其他零售商也经历了销售额下降，表明了该行业更广泛的趋势。尽管通胀率有所放缓，但美国人购买消费包装商品（consumer packaged goods, CPG）的支出比 2019 年增加了三分之一，凸显了持续性通胀的影响。这篇文章表明，虽然价格可能不会普遍下降，但普遍涨价的时代似乎已经结束。

## **美国零售商** 的应对策略
- **降价**：Target 和 Walmart 等 **美国零售商** 通过降低必需品、杂货和家庭必需品的价格来适应消费者情绪。他们还提供短期内更大的折扣（如 Walmart 的 rollback）来吸引注重价格的购物者。
- **影响**：降价有利于所有消费者，特别是低收入人群，因为高通胀对他们的影响更大，他们可能不得不减少非必要购买或转用更便宜的替代品。Target 降价的商品包括牛奶、黄油和纸巾等日常生活必需品。

## 对不同收入群体的影响
降价策略对所有消费者都有利，但对于低收入人群的好处更为显著，因为他们受通胀的影响更大，可能不得不削减非必要开支或转用更便宜的替代品。Target 降价的商品包括牛奶、黄油和纸巾等与收入水平无关的生活必需品。

## 潜在的长期影响
**美国零售商** 的这一举动可能预示着一个新的时代，即竞争性定价和注重价值的策略成为主流，而不是普遍涨价。零售商可能需要调整其商业模式，尤其是供应链管理和劳动力成本方面，以在提供更低价格的同时保持盈利能力。这种转变也强调了顺应消费者情绪和动态经济环境中购买行为的重要性。

## Summary: 

**US retailers**, **Target** and **Walmart**, are leading a shift in the sector by **lowering prices** on thousands of items, signaling a change after years of high inflation. This move comes as consumers show signs of "inflation fatigue," with 71% of Americans viewing economic conditions negatively per an FT-Michigan Ross poll. Target and Walmart's price cuts aim to keep them competitive and attract budget-conscious shoppers. Other retailers like Lowe's and Macy's are also experiencing sales declines, indicating a broader trend in the industry. While inflation rates have slowed, Americans' spending on consumer packaged goods is up by a third compared to 2019, highlighting the impact of persistent inflation. The article suggests that while prices may not decrease across the board, the era of universal price increases appears to be over.

2. Q: How is the shift in retail pricing impacting different income groups? 
A: Lowering prices benefits all consumers but especially those with lower incomes who have been disproportionately affected by inflation and may have had to cut back on non-essential purchases or switch to cheaper alternatives.
