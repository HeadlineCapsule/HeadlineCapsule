# 中国限制获取外国投资者股市交易的实时数据

**中国限制了获取外国投资者**在大陆股市活动实时交易数据的渠道，尤其针对的是通过**沪深港通**，从**香港北上交易**上海和深圳证券交易所的交易数据。这一举措从周一开始实施，是中国监管机构在2月股市大幅下跌后，为**抑制市场波动**和**提振信心**而采取的更广泛措施的一部分。

**香港证券交易所证实了这一变化**，该变化最初由中国当局在4月宣布，称需要确保 "市场数据披露的完整性"。中国还计划调整**大陆投资者**交易香港股票的**南下交易数据披露**。

**中国监管机构一直积极管理市场波动**，限制**高频数据**的发布，并严格审查基金经理的做法。证券交易所现在将提供每日成交量和成交额数据，而不是实时外国资金流动信息。

**市场参与者指出**，实时数据的缺失可能会影响**量化基金的交易策略**，特别是那些依赖算法驱动方法的基金。然而，预计该举措对市场的长期整体影响较小。

**监管机构对市场稳定的重视**促使主要指数出现反弹，沪深300指数和香港恒生指数从今年早些时候的低点回升。外国投资者也重返股市，被香港上市公司较低的估值和较高的股息所吸引。

# China reduces access to live data on share trades by foreign investors 

**China has restricted access** to live trading data on foreign investor activities in mainland stock markets, specifically **northbound trades from Hong Kong** to exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen via the **Stock Connect trading link**. This move, effective Monday, is part of a broader effort by Chinese regulators to **curb market volatility** and **boost sentiment**, following a significant sell-off in February. 

**The Hong Kong Stock Exchange confirmed** the change, which was initially announced by Chinese authorities in April, citing the need to ensure the "integrity of market data disclosure." China also plans to **adjust data disclosure** for "southbound" trades of Hong Kong stocks by mainland investors. 

**Chinese regulators have been actively managing market volatility** by limiting the release of **high-frequency data** and scrutinizing fund managers' practices. The bourses will now provide daily turnover and volume data instead of real-time foreign flow information. 

**Market participants note** that the absence of live data may impact **quantitative funds' trading strategies**, particularly those relying on algorithm-driven approaches. However, the overall impact on the market is expected to be minimal over the long term. 

**The regulatory focus on market stability** has led to a rebound in key indices, with the CSI 300 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng recovering from lows earlier in the year. Foreign investors are also returning to the market, attracted by lower valuations and higher dividends in Hong Kong-listed shares.
