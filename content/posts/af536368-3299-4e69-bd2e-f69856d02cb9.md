“小队”与AIPAC：加沙战争笼罩纽约民主党初选

国会选举在贾马勒·鲍曼和埃利奥特·恩格尔之间展开，由于多种因素，这场选举竞争非常激烈。首先，该地区的人口统计数据随着时间而变化，从一个由爱尔兰和意大利工人阶级组成的飞地，转变为以黑人为主体的西班牙裔社区，这可能会影响选民的偏好。其次，两位候选人的支持率都很高：鲍曼得到了像J Street这样的进步团体的支持，而恩格尔则得到了担心他关于以色列政策立场的犹太捐赠者的支持。

哈马斯和以色列之间的最近冲突在选举中也发挥了重要作用。鲍曼投票反对一项谴责哈马斯的决议，并承诺支持以色列，这一举动受到了一些选民的批评，尤其是那些与犹太社区有密切联系的人。此外，鲍曼在国内问题上的立场，例如拜登的基础设施法案，也是选民们争论的焦点。

外部团体和活动家的参与使选举更加复杂，他们正在努力说服选民支持他们所青睐的候选人。例如，犹太活动家们一直在努力将共和党和独立选民重新注册为民主党，以便他们能够参加可能决定最终胜者的初选。

总之，这场选举之所以如此激烈，是因为人口统计数据的变化、两位候选人的支持者都非常坚定、与以色列政策有关的事件以及外部团体试图影响选民的行为。结果可能取决于哪位候选人能够最好地吸引具有不同优先事项和关切的多元化选民。

 The congressional race between Jamaal Bowman and Eliot Engel is highly competitive due to several factors. Firstly, the district's demographics have shifted over time from a working-class Irish and Italian enclave to largely Black and Hispanic communities, which may influence voter preferences. Secondly, both candidates have strong backing: Bowman has support from progressive groups like J Street, while Engel is backed by Jewish donors who are concerned about his stance on Israel policy.

The recent conflict between Hamas and Israel also played a significant role in the race. Bowman's vote against a resolution condemning Hamas and pledging support for Israel drew criticism from some voters, particularly those with strong ties to Jewish communities. Additionally, Bowman's stance on domestic issues like Biden's infrastructure bill has also been a point of contention among constituents.

The race is further complicated by the involvement of outside groups and activists who are working to sway voters in favor of their preferred candidate. Jewish activists, for example, have worked to re-register Republican and Independent voters as Democrats so they can participate in a primary that will likely determine the eventual winner.

Ultimately, this race is competitive due to shifting demographics, strong backing from both candidates' supporters, recent events related to Israel policy, and the involvement of outside groups working to influence voters. The outcome may hinge on which candidate can best appeal to a diverse electorate with varying priorities and concerns.
