# 中国经销商放弃外国品牌汽油车，转投本土电动汽车

**中国汽车经销商正在经历一场重大转型，其焦点从外国品牌的汽油动力汽车转向** **本土电动汽车（EV）**。这种转变的一个典型例子是上海郊区一家汽车经销商的改造，其展厅原先摆放的日本豪华品牌英菲尼迪的车型，如今已被中国高端品牌极氪的电动汽车所取代。

**中国第四大经销商集团永达汽车已将其两家经销商门店转变为极氪中心，展示了中国电动汽车制造商在市场上的崛起**。该公司终止了与英菲尼迪和荣威等外国品牌的合作，称这些品牌的盈利能力和销量正在下降。海鹏集团等其他经销商也跟随这一趋势，调整了其品牌组合，以包含更多本土电动汽车品牌。

**这一转变在市场数据中有所体现，2023年中国的燃油汽车经销商数量下降，而电动汽车经销商数量则显著上升**。这一转型是由消费者对电动汽车日益增长的需求以及经销商适应行业变革的需要所推动的。外国品牌正在失去市场份额，而中国电动汽车品牌则蓬勃发展，这可能会造成外国品牌销量和经销商数量双下降的恶性循环。

**主要依赖燃油汽车销售的中国经销商正面临利润急剧下降的困境**。例如，孙奋达集团的毛利率大幅下降，突显了不断演变的汽车市场的激烈竞争。经销商还面临着整个行业产能过剩和利润薄的问题，一些电动汽车制造商最初尝试了直销模式，但现在正转向经销商，以更经济的方式扩大销售渠道。

**知名电动汽车制造商极氪和小鹏与经销商建立了独特的合作伙伴关系，打破了传统的加盟模式**。这些合作伙伴关系为经销商提供了新的收入来源，让他们在电动汽车革命中发挥作用，同时也帮助电动汽车制造商平衡成本并扩大客户覆盖范围。

中国汽车行业的这一转型体现了中国对绿色未来的承诺，也展现了其国内电动汽车行业的韧性。随着电气化趋势的加速发展，经销商和制造商都在不断适应，以保持在这一快速变革的市场中的竞争力。

# China's dealers ditch foreign-branded petrol cars for homegrown EVs

**Chinese car dealerships are undergoing a significant transformation, shifting their focus from foreign-branded petrol-powered vehicles to** **homegrown electric vehicles (EVs)**. This shift is exemplified by the makeover of a car dealership on the outskirts of Shanghai, where models from the Japanese luxury brand Infiniti have been replaced by EVs from Zeekr, a premium Chinese brand. 

**Yongda Auto, China's fourth-largest dealer chain, has converted two of its dealerships to Zeekr Houses, showcasing the rise of Chinese EV makers in the market**. The company has terminated partnerships with foreign brands like Infiniti and Roewe, citing their declining profitability and sales. Other dealers, such as Haipeng Group, have also embraced this trend, revamping their brand portfolios to include more local EV brands. 

**This shift is reflected in market data, with a decline in the number of internal combustion engine (ICE) car dealerships and a significant rise in EV dealerships in China in 2023**. The transition is driven by the increasing consumer demand for EVs and the need for dealers to adapt to changing industry trends. Foreign brands are losing market share to Chinese EVs, creating a potential vicious cycle of declining sales and dealership numbers. 

**Chinese dealers relying primarily on ICE car sales are facing steep profit declines**. Sunfonda Group, for instance, experienced a significant drop in gross profit, highlighting the intense competition in the evolving automotive market. Dealers are also navigating industry-wide overcapacity and thin margins, with some EV makers initially attempting direct-to-consumer sales but now turning to dealers to expand their sales channels more cost-effectively. 

**Prominent EV makers like Zeekr and Xpeng are forging unique partnerships with dealers, deviating from the traditional franchise model**. These partnerships provide dealers with new sources of revenue and a role in the EV revolution, while also helping EV makers balance costs and expand their customer reach. 

This transformation of China's automotive landscape demonstrates the country's commitment to a greener future and the resilience of its domestic EV industry. As the trend toward electrification accelerates, dealers and manufacturers alike are adapting to stay competitive in this rapidly evolving market.
