为了缓解英国社会住房危机，JLL表示“购买权”计划必须取消。

# 房地产咨询公司 JLL 呼吁英国未来政府废除“购买权”计划

**新闻摘要：**

房地产咨询公司 JLL 呼吁英国未来政府废除“购买权”计划，该计划允许市政租户以优惠价格购买自己的房屋。这项由前首相玛格丽特·撒切尔在 20 世纪 80 年代推出的政策，因其对可负担租房供应量的影响而被视为导致英格兰社会住房危机的原因之一。

**要点：**

- JLL 建议废除“购买权”，这将有助于减轻社会住房等待名单的压力。
- 在截至去年 3 月的一年中，超过 14,000 套市政房屋根据该计划出售，导致社会租房净损失超过 11,700 套。
- “购买权”政策自实施以来，已有超过 200 万套房产被租户购买。批评人士认为，这迫使市政机构在没有提供足够资金用于替代房源的情况下出售房产，导致每年社会住房的总体损失。
- JLL 估计，要清除英格兰的等待名单（目前有超过 120 万户家庭），需要花费 2,050 亿英镑来建造足够的社会住房。
- 如果工党在即将于 7 月 4 日举行的大选中获胜，他们承诺将对可负担、社会和市政住房进行重大投资。他们的影子住房部长马修·佩尼库克（Matthew Pennycook）提议减少“购买权”购房的折扣，同时为长期租户保持合理的折扣。
- 来自无家可归者慈善机构 Shelter 的波利·尼特（Polly Neate）和伦敦市长萨迪克·汗（Sadiq Khan）等其他人士也呼吁暂停或审查该政策，因为它对社会住房的可用性产生了影响。
- 苏格兰政府于 2016 年废除了“购买权”。

 **Summary of Article:**  
The property consulting company JLL has called on the UK's future government to scrap the Right to Buy scheme, which allows council tenants to purchase their homes at a discount. This policy, introduced in the 1nineteen eighties by then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher, is seen as contributing to the social housing crisis in England due to its impact on the availability of affordable rental properties.

**Key Points:**  
- JLL suggests that ending Right to Buy would help alleviate pressure on social housing waiting lists.
- Over 14,000 council homes were sold under this scheme in the year leading up to last March, resulting in a net loss of over 11,700 social rented homes.  
- The Right to Buy policy has led to more than 2 million properties being bought by tenants since its introduction. Critics argue that it forces councils to sell off properties without providing enough funds for replacement, leading to an overall loss of social housing each year.
- To clear the waiting list in England (currently over 1.2 million households), JLL estimates a cost of £205 billion would be required to build sufficient social homes.  
- The Labour party has pledged significant investment in affordable, social and council housing if they win the upcoming general election on July 4th. Their shadow housing minister Matthew Pennycook proposes reducing discounts for Right to Buy purchases while maintaining a reasonable discount for long-term tenants.
- Other voices, such as Polly Neate from homelessness charity Shelter and London mayor Sadiq Khan, have also called for the policy's suspension or review due to its impact on social housing availability.  
- The Scottish government abolished Right to Buy in 201nineteen sixteen.
