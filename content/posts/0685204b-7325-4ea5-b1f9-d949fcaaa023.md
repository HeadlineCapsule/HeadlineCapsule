特朗普怒斥“骗局”有罪判决，将自己描绘成烈士

# 前美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在“封口费”审判中被判有罪后，在他的纽约家中举行新闻发布会，对判决结果发表意见。他批评法官，并声称乔·拜登（Joe Biden）政府复兴了此案，作为对他进行政治迫害的一部分。陪审团对所有指控都判特朗普有罪：

- 唐纳德·特朗普在这场审判中被判有罪的意义是什么？
    - 这标志着一个前所未有的事件，因为它使唐纳德·特朗普成为有史以来第一位在生前成为罪犯的美国总统。他的定罪可能会对其政治未来产生重大影响，并可能影响公众在他潜在的竞选或其他活动期间对他的看法。该判决还提出了关于这可能会如何影响 2024 年选举以及特朗普因可能的判刑限制而无法自由旅行的问题。
- 唐纳德·特朗普如何回应他对自己的定罪？
    - 在被定罪后，唐纳德·特朗普将自己描绘成一个受腐败体系和政治对手迫害的殉道者。他声称，在他在 2024 年宣布竞选白宫后，乔·拜登政府复兴了这起案件。通过将自己描绘成无辜的一方，特朗普试图凝聚支持者力量，并将审判描绘成一场出于政治动机的攻击。
- 这次定罪对唐纳德·特朗普的政治未来有什么潜在后果？
    - 定罪可能会对唐纳德·特朗普的政治未来产生几种后果。首先，它可能损害他在未决定选民中的声誉，并影响他们对他作为 2024 年选举或其他潜在竞选活动可行候选人的看法。其次，由于判决而产生的判刑限制可能会限制他在 11 月 5 日选举之前参加竞选活动的旅行能力。最后，这次定罪可能会影响特朗普与政治盟友和对手的关系，也会影响公众对他曾担任总统的整体遗产的看法。
- 乔·拜登政府如何回应唐纳德·特朗普声称自己是审判受害者？
    - 乔·拜登政府的回应强调了美国司法体系是公平且公正的，这与唐纳德·特朗普的说法相反。拜登竞选活动的传播总监迈克尔·泰勒（Michael Tyler）表示：“美国刚刚目睹了一位困惑、绝望和失败的唐纳德·特朗普漫谈自己的个人不满，并谎言关于美国司法体系。”这一回应试图反驳任何暗示法律程序存在腐败或偏见的叙事。
- 判决后筹款的意义是什么？
    - 唐纳德·特朗普竞选活动在判决后收到的大量小额捐款表明他的支持者基础仍然坚定，并对审判结果感到愤怒。这种资金支持可以用来推动进一步的政治活动，例如潜在的法律挑战或未来的竞选工作。它也是衡量特朗普定罪后公众情绪的指标，可能会影响其支持者和对手前进

**Summary of Article:**  
Former President Donald Trump, after being convicted in a "hush money" trial, held a news conference at his New York home to address the verdict. He criticized the judge and claimed that the case was revived by Joe Biden's administration as part of a scam against him. The jury found Trump guilty on all cuits:
    - What is the significance of Donald Trump being convicted in this trial?
        A: This trial marks an unprecedented event, as it makes Donald Trump the first US president to become a felon while still alive. His conviction could have significant implications for his political future and may affect public perception of him during potential campaigns or other endeavors. The verdict also raises questions about how this might impact the 2024 election, as well as Trump's ability to travel freely due to possible sentencing restrictions.
    - How does Donald Trump portray himself in response to his conviction?
        A: In response to his conviction, Donald Trump presents himself as a martyr who has been victimized by a corrupt system and political opponents. He claims that the case against him was revived by Joe Biden's administration after he announced his bid for the White House in 2024. By casting himself as an innocent party, Trump attempts to rally support from his base and portray the trial as a politically motivated attack.
    - What are some potential consequences of this conviction on Donald Trump's political future?
        A: The conviction could have several consequences for Donald Trump's political future. Firstly, it may damage his reputation among undecided voters and affect their perception of him as a viable candidate in the 2024 election or any other potential campaigns. Secondly, sentencing restrictions resulting from the verdict might limit his ability to travel for campaign events leading up to the November 5 election. Lastly, this conviction could impact Trump's relationships with political allies and adversaries, as well as influence public opinion on his overall legacy as a former president.
    - How has Joe Biden's administration responded to Donald Trump's claims of being victimized by the trial?
        A: The response from Joe Biden's administration emphasizes that the American justice system is fair and impartial, contrary to Donald Trump's assertions. Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director, stated that "America just witnessed a confused, desperate, and defeated Donald Trump ramble about his own personal grievances and lie about the American justice system." This response seeks to counteract any narrative suggesting corruption or bias within the legal proceedings.
    - What is the significance of the fundraising following the verdict?
        A: The significant amount of small-dollar donations received by Donald Trump's campaign after the verdict indicates that his base remains supportive and outraged by the trial outcome. This financial backing could be used to fuel further political activities, such as potential legal challenges or future campaign efforts. It also serves as a metric for gauging public sentiment towards Trump in light of the conviction and may influence strategies employed by both his supporters and opponents moving forward.
