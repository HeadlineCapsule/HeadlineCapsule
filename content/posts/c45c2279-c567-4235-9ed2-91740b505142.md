# 欧盟国家如何推动进一步的外包移民 

**包括意大利、荷兰和波兰在内的15个欧盟国家敦促欧盟委员会实施更严格的移民措施，尽管欧盟最近对其庇护和移民政策进行了改革**。在致欧盟委员会的信中，这些国家呼吁采取“补充措施”来解决非正规移民的根源，并管理进入欧盟的移民流动。该信提议加强与第三国的伙伴关系，类似于与突尼斯和土耳其的协议，在那里，**通过经济诱因遏制了移民**，尽管**存在侵犯人权的行为**。另一项建议是在一个未指明的第三国建立一个“返回中心”，被拒绝的庇护申请者可以被送往那里等待“最终遣返”。尽管这些倡议仍较为模糊，并面临实施挑战，但它们反映了欧盟国家日益增长的趋势，即**外包移民管理**并提出**严厉的措施**来遏制非正规移民。 

与此同时，随着**中美贸易紧张局势升级**，北京市经济规划机构的成员建议了一个潜在的解决方案：以技术专长交换服务业专业知识。中国五年经济计划监督委员会成员朱民承认了贸易保护主义的挑战，但强调了中国和欧洲之间潜在的协作机会。中国寻求从其传统的基础设施和出口主导型增长模式转型，旨在扩大其服务业，而这是欧洲的强项。朱民强调了中国服务业与制造业之间在生产力方面的差距，这为双方的互惠互利提供了可能。该提议出现在中国公司，尤其是清洁技术行业的公司受到欧盟贸易调查，以及美国对中国电动汽车征收关税的时候。

# How EU countries are pushing for further migration outsourcing 

**A group of 15 EU countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland, are urging the European Commission to implement stricter migration measures, despite the recent reform of the EU's asylum and migration policy**. In a letter sent to the Commission, these countries call for "complementary efforts" to tackle the root causes of irregular migration and manage migration movements into the EU. The letter proposes increased partnerships with third countries, similar to the agreements with Tunisia and Turkey, where **migration was curbed through financial incentives**, despite **human rights violations**. Another suggestion is to create a "returns hub" in an unspecified third country, where individuals whose asylum claims have been rejected can be sent to await "final removal." While these initiatives are still vague and face implementation challenges, they reflect a growing trend among EU countries to **outsource migration management** and propose **draconian measures** to curb irregular migration.

**Meanwhile, as US-China trade tensions rise, a member of Beijing's economic planning body suggests a potential solution: exchanging technological know-how for service sector expertise**. Zhu Min, a member of the committee overseeing China's five-year economic plan, acknowledges the challenges of trade protectionism but emphasizes the potential for collaboration between China and Europe. China seeks to transition from its traditional growth model based on infrastructure and exports, aiming to expand its service industry, an area where Europe excels. Zhu highlights the productivity gap between China's service sector and its industry, presenting an opportunity for mutual benefit. This proposal comes as the **EU launches trade investigations into Chinese companies, particularly in the clean technology sector, and as the US imposes tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles**.
