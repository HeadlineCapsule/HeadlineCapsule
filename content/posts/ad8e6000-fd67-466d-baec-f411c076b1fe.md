# 里希·苏纳克声称英国“处于十字路口”，并准备保守党参加选举

里希·苏纳克将于周一在伦敦发表讲话，**旨在提振保守党士气**，他承认**英国正处于十字路口，面临重要的政治选择**。首相承诺将带来“大胆的想法”，旨在**改善英国社会**并**恢复民族自豪感和信心**。他将强调当下时刻的紧迫性，并突出未来几年变化速度之快。

苏纳克的讲话正值保守党在民意调查中落后工党高达20个百分点。保守党最近在地方选举中失利，并面临预计将于今年下半年举行的大选。然而，苏纳克的团队仍然充满希望，他们引用经济数据和选举统计学家迈克尔·拉斯勒教授的分析结果，该结果表明地方选举的结果可能不会直接转化为大选结果。

首相将强调维护国家安全和应对全球挑战的必要性，例如**战争、移民潮和对共同价值观的威胁**。他将批评工党在**卢旺达遣送计划**上的立场，以及他们未能承诺将国防开支提高到GDP的2.5%。苏纳克还将承认保守党执政时间之长，但将强调他们在各种危机中的处理方式，包括**全球金融危机、新冠疫情和乌克兰战争**。他将呼吁英国乐观的精神和克服挑战的信念。

苏纳克的顾问们认为，民意调查可能夸大了工党领先的优势，而拉斯勒的分析预测可能会出现悬浮议会，批评人士则认为，全国选举中的投票行为可能不同，策略性投票和英国改革党候选人可能会影响结果。

# Rishi Sunak to declare Britain is ‘at a crossroads’ as he readies Tories for election

Rishi Sunak, in a **bid to boost Conservative morale**, is set to deliver a speech in London on Monday, acknowledging that **Britain stands at a crossroads with significant political choices ahead**. The prime minister will promise to bring "bold ideas" to the table, aiming to **transform British society for the better** and **restore national pride and confidence**. He will emphasize the urgency of the moment, highlighting the rapid pace of change in the coming years. 

Sunak's speech comes as the Conservative Party trails behind the Labour Party in opinion polls by a significant margin of 20 points. The Tories have recently suffered losses in local elections and face an upcoming general election, expected in the latter half of the year. However, Sunak's team remains hopeful, citing economic data and psephologist Professor Michael Thrasher's analysis, which suggests the local election results may not translate directly into a general election outcome. 

The prime minister will stress the need to safeguard the nation's security and address global challenges, such as **war, rising immigration, and threats to shared values**. He will criticize the Labour Party for their stance on the **Rwanda removal scheme** and their failure to commit to increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. Sunak will also acknowledge the Conservative Party's lengthy tenure in power but will emphasize their handling of various crises, including the **global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine war**. He will appeal to Britain's optimistic spirit and belief in overcoming challenges. 

Sunak's advisers believe the polls may exaggerate Labour's lead, and while Thrasher's analysis suggests a potential hung parliament, critics argue that voting behavior in a national election could differ, with tactical voting and Reform UK candidates potentially impacting the outcome.
