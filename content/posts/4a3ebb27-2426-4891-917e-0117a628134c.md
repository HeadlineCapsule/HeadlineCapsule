# 奥地利莱伊芬沙因银行终止与奥列格·杰里帕斯卡的**资产互换交易**

**莱伊芬沙因银行国际集团（RBI）**，即在俄罗斯运营的最大西方贷款机构，决定终止与遭制裁的俄罗斯寡头**奥列格·杰里帕斯卡**计划好的**资产互换**交易。该交易涉及杰里帕斯卡在奥地利建筑公司**Strabag**25%的股份和莱伊芬沙因银行国际集团在俄罗斯的资产。莱伊芬沙因银行国际集团的决定是在监管机构和西方政府的压力之下做出的，银行称其无法获得继续交易的必要批准。

该银行原本打算通过此次交易**汇回收益**到其位于奥地利的总部，因为目前**克里姆林宫的立法**导致俄罗斯的利润无法汇出。即使其他西方银行在2022年2月俄罗斯**全面入侵乌克兰**后已经撤出，莱伊芬沙因银行国际集团仍继续在俄罗斯运营并获取利润，因此受到密切关注。该贷款机构为其立场辩护，称其致力于服务客户和员工，但面临着包括**欧洲中央银行**在内的监管机构的压力，要求其加快退出俄罗斯的步伐。

莱伊芬沙因银行国际集团试图在俄罗斯的商业利益与不断变化的监管环境和地缘政治紧张局势之间取得平衡，但这一努力充满挑战，最终导致放弃与杰里帕斯卡的交易。如今，该银行面临着在其俄罗斯业务的出售中航行，这可能导致重大损失，同时还要应对美国当局的关切，并更新其公共信息，以符合其减少在俄罗斯运营的承诺。

# Austria’s Raiffeisen **Scraps** Oleg Deripaska **Asset Swap Deal**

**Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI)**, the largest Western lender operating in Russia, has decided to terminate a planned **asset swap** deal with Russian oligarch **Oleg Deripaska**, who has been sanctioned. The deal involved Deripaska's 25% stake in **Strabag**, an Austrian construction company, and RBI's assets in Russia. RBI's decision comes amid pressure from regulators and Western governments, with the bank stating that it could not obtain the necessary approvals to proceed. 

The bank had intended to **repatriate earnings** to its Austrian headquarters through this deal, as profits made in Russia are currently trapped due to **Kremlin legislation**. RBI has been under scrutiny for its continued operations and profits in Russia, even as other Western banks withdrew following the **full-scale invasion of Ukraine** in February 2022. The lender has defended its position, citing its commitment to customers and employees, but has faced pressure from regulators, including the **European Central Bank**, to accelerate its withdrawal. 

RBI's efforts to balance its business interests in Russia with the evolving regulatory landscape and geopolitical tensions have proven challenging, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the Deripaska deal. The bank now faces the task of navigating the sale of its Russian business, which may result in significant losses, while also addressing concerns from US authorities and updating its public messaging to align with its stated commitment to reducing operations in Russia.
