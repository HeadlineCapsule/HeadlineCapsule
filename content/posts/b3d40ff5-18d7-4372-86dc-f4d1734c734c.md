## Summary:
Japan's **Norinchukin** plans a capital raise of ¥1.2tn ($7.7bn) due to losses in its bond holdings caused by higher interest rates in the US and Europe. The agricultural lender, which manages savings for farmers and fishermen across Japan, expects a loss of about ¥500bn in the current financial year. Its paper losses from bond holdings increased to ¥2.2tn as of March end, up from ¥1.7tn a year earlier. Norinchukin's investment strategy has been impacted by rising yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs), with its common equity Tier-1 capital ratio at 16.4%. The lender intends to reshuffle its portfolio of assets under management for long-term profitability, focusing on the extent to which it will sell off US and European government bonds in favor of Japanese JGBs.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: How has Norinchukin's investment strategy been impacted by global interest rate changes?
A: The surge in US and European interest rates, as central banks sought to tame inflation, negatively affected Norinchukin's overseas investment portfolio. Its bond holdings experienced paper losses of ¥2.2tn due to the rapid pace of these rate hikes.

Q: What measures is Norinchukin taking in response to its financial challenges?
A: In response to its current financial situation, Norinchukin plans a capital raise of ¥1.2tn ($7.7bn) and intends to review the way it balances investment risks. The lender also plans to reshuffle its portfolio of assets under management for long-term profitability by potentially selling off US and European government bonds in favor of Japanese JGBs, which have seen rising yields after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates.

Q: What are some historical examples of Norinchukin's aggressive investment policies leading to financial challenges?
A: In the past, Norinchukin has faced difficulties due to its aggressive investment policy during the global financial crisis when it had to raise emergency funds after placing significant bets on asset-backed securities based on US subprime mortgages. This resulted in tapping into tens of billions of dollars from its agricultural, fishery, and forestry cooperative members.
