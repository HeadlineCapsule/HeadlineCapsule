改革派候选人马苏德·佩泽什基安搅动伊朗总统选举

# 伊朗总统选举概览：

伊朗即将举行的总统选举因改革派候选人马苏德·佩泽什基安（Masoud Pezeshkian）的加入而生变。在几位强硬派候选人获得批准后，这一意外发展令人瞩目。

佩泽什基安是前卫生部长和议会议员，以开放、愿意批评伊朗强硬政策以及致力于正义和平等而闻名。他的竞选重点是促进政权与民众之间的更好关系，同时通过全国和解努力解决对政治家的广泛不信任问题。

负责批准总统候选人的保守派主导的机构守护委员会（Guardian Council）已批准佩泽什基安与其他竞争对手一起参加竞选，包括领先者穆罕默德·巴格尔·加利布夫（Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf）、德黑兰市长阿里雷扎·扎卡尼（Alireza Zakani）和前核谈判代表赛义德·贾利利（Saeed Jalili）。

被取消资格的前改革派第一副总统伊萨克·贾汉吉里（Es'haq Jahangiri）以及改革派前总统穆罕默德·哈塔米（Mohammad Khatami）和前外交部长贾瓦德·扎里夫（Javad Zarif）对佩泽什基安的支持加强了他的竞选。

分析人士认为，佩泽什基安在宗教研究方面的背景可能使他成为包括传统保守派在内的社会各阶层都能接受的候选人。伊朗领导人意识到需要高投票率来展示公众合法性，如果他战胜逆境获胜，他们可能会与他合作。

**要点：**
- 马苏德·佩泽什基安作为伊朗总统选举中的改革派候选人，扰乱了选举局势。
- 守护委员会批准了他的候选资格，这让许多观察家感到惊讶，因为他们预计只有强硬派候选人才能参加竞选。
- 佩泽什基安以开放和致力于正义和平等而闻名；他通过全国和解努力改善政权与民众之间的关系。
- 其他竞争对手包括领先者穆罕默德·巴格尔·加利布夫、阿里雷扎·扎卡尼和赛义德·贾利利。
- 佩泽什基安获得了改革派人士伊萨克·贾汉吉里、穆罕默德·哈塔米和贾瓦德·扎里夫的支持。
- 分析人士认为，他的宗教背景可能吸引更广泛的选民群体，包括传统保守派。

 **Summary of Iran's Presidential Election:**

The upcoming presidential election in Iran has been shaken by the inclusion of Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate, on the list of eligible candidates. This unexpected development comes after several hardline candidates were approved for the race. 

Pezeshkian is a former health minister and member of parliament known for his openness, willingness to criticize Iran's hardline policies, and commitment to justice and equality. His campaign focuses on fostering better relations between the regime and the population while addressing widespread mistrust in politicians through national reconciliation efforts.

The Guardian Council, a hardline-dominated body responsible for approving presidential candidates, has cleared Pezeshkian to run against other contenders such as Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf (frontrunner), Alireza Zakani (mayor of Tehran), and Saeed Jalili (former nuclear negotiator).

Pezeshkian's endorsement by Es’haq Jahangiri, a reformist former first vice-president who was disqualified from the vote, as well as support from Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, and Javad Zarif, a former foreign minister, has bolstered his campaign.

Analysts suggest that Pezeshkian's background in religious studies could make him an acceptable candidate for various segments of society, including traditional conservatives. The Iranian leadership is aware of the need for high voter turnout to demonstrate public legitimacy and may work with Pezeshkian if he wins against the odds.

**Key Points:**
- Masoud Pezeshkian's inclusion as a reformist candidate in Iran's presidential election has shaken up the race.
- The Guardian Council approved his candidacy, surprising many observers who expected only hardline candidates to be on the ballot.
- Pezeshkian is known for his openness and commitment to justice and equality; he aims to improve relations between the regime and the population through national reconciliation efforts.
- Other contenders include Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf (frontrunner), Alireza Zakani, and Saeed Jalili.
- Pezeshkian has received endorsements from prominent reformists such as Es’haq Jahangiri, Mohammad Khatami, and Javad Zarif.
- Analysts believe that his religious background could appeal to a broader range of voters, including traditional conservatives.
