欧盟寻求阻止俄罗斯通过白俄罗斯进口西方豪华汽车。

## 摘要：
**欧洲联盟（欧盟）计划对白俄罗斯加强制裁**，以堵住莫斯科进口西方**豪华汽车**和其他由于乌克兰战争而被禁止进入俄罗斯的商品的漏洞。这些新的限制措施旨在“尽可能减少规避风险”，禁止向白俄罗斯出口或通过白俄罗斯出口技术、军用品、液化天然气（LNG）和钻石。如果获得通过，这将对俄罗斯的豪华汽车进口产生重大影响，因为欧洲汽车制造商仍然可以向白俄罗斯出售高端车辆，但不能直接销售给俄罗斯。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 问题：当前对白俄罗斯的制裁如何使莫斯科能够绕过对西方商品的限制？
   回答：目前针对白俄罗斯的较弱制裁制度允许莫斯科利用其盟友作为后门来进口豪华汽车和其它被禁止的西方商品。欧洲汽车制造商向白俄罗斯出售高端车辆，然后通过各种手段走私到俄罗斯，例如申报贸易数据时显示这些车辆来源于白俄罗斯。

2. 问题：收紧对白俄罗斯的制裁将如何影响俄罗斯的豪华汽车进口？
   回答：通过禁止向或经由白俄罗斯出口技术、军用品、液化天然气和钻石来加强对白俄罗斯的制裁，将大大遏制豪华汽车流入俄罗斯。这是因为欧洲汽车制造商目前只能因制裁而将高端车辆出售给白俄罗斯，而不是直接出售给俄罗斯。如果欧盟成员国采纳这项新措施，它将破坏俄罗斯走私链条，影响莫斯科和其他地区西方汽车的供应。

3. 问题：立陶宛海关在检查运往白俄罗斯的货物时面临哪些挑战？
   回答：立陶宛小型海关部门难以应对复杂的禁止货物体系，在检查发往邻国白俄罗斯的货物时面临重重困难。“预防制裁规避”是一项非常繁重的任务，2023年他们39,000次拒绝通关，并向其他成员国发送了15,000多份风险报告，指出可能违反制裁的行为。两个制裁制度之间的差异留下了“非常明显的漏洞”，使海关官员难以有效执行对禁止货物的限制。

## Summary:
The European Union (EU) plans to tighten sanctions against Belarus in an effort to close a loophole allowing Moscow to import western luxury cars and other goods banned in Russia due to the war in Ukraine. The new curbs aim "to minimise the risk of circumvention" by banning exports to and via Belarus of technology, military-use goods, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and diamonds from Belarus. If adopted, this would significantly impact luxury car imports into Russia as European carmakers can still sell their high-end vehicles to Belarus but not directly to Russia.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How have the current sanctions against Belarus enabled Moscow's circumvention of restrictions on western goods? 
   A: The existing weaker sanctions regime in place for Belarus has allowed Moscow to use its ally as a backdoor for importing luxury cars and other banned western goods into Russia. This is achieved by European carmakers selling their high-end vehicles to Belarus, which are then smuggled into Russia through various means such as filing trade data that shows the origin of these vehicles as being from Belarus.
   
2. Q: What impact would tightening sanctions against Belarus have on luxury car imports in Russia? 
   A: Tightening sanctions against Belarus by banning exports to and via Belarus of technology, military-use goods, LNG, and diamonds from Belarus would significantly stem the flow of luxury cars into Russia. This is because European carmakers can currently sell their high-end vehicles only to Belarus but not directly to Russia due to sanctions. If adopted by EU member states, this new curb would disrupt Russian smuggling chains that supply western cars in Moscow and other parts of the country.
   
3. Q: What challenges do Lithuania's customs service face when inspecting cargo bound for Belarus? 
   A: Lithuania's small customs service is struggling to cope with the "complicated" system of banned goods when inspecting cargo bound for neighboring Belarus. Preventing sanctions circumvention has been a "very heavy workload," as evidenced by the fact that they denied clearance 39,000 times in 2023 and sent more than 15,000 risk reports to other member states citing potential breaches of sanctions. The differences between the two sanctions regimes have left "very clear holes," making it difficult for customs officials to effectively enforce the restrictions on banned goods.
