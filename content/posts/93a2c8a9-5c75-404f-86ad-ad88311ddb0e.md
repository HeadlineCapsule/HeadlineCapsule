英国下届政府必须与欧盟建立更好的贸易关系，游说团体称

# 英国商会（BCC）警告：脱欧后，新政府需改善与欧盟的贸易关系

**摘要：**
本文讨论了英国商会（British Chambers of Commerce , BCC）的警告，即下一届英国政府需要在脱欧后改善与欧盟的贸易关系。随着企业面临越来越高的成本和复杂性，BCC 总干事 Shevaun Haviland 强调，更严格的移民规则和新法规正在影响该国的投资和增长。工党领袖 Keir Starmer 表示有意深化与欧盟的贸易和国防联系，但不会重新加入单一市场或允许自由流动。

**有趣的问题：**

Q1: 脱欧相关的变化如何特别影响了小企业？
A1: 本文强调，对植物和动物产品的新边境检查正在造成惩罚性的成本，这尤其影响了向欧盟出口的小公司。这些额外费用使它们更难向欧盟销售，从而影响了其增长潜力和盈利能力。

Q2: Shevaun Haviland 认为哪些具体的变化将最有利于企业？
A2: 根据本文，放宽移民规则 merupakan关键变化之一，可以显著帮助英国企业。这一变化将促进人员为工作而流动，最终将有利于在英国境内或与欧盟贸易的公司。

Q3: Sir Mike Rake 对脱欧和脱欧对英国经济的影响有何看法？
A3: BT Group、KPMG 和易捷航空的前主席迈克·雷克爵士（Sir Mike Rake）认为，“脱欧是我们现代历史上最大的经济和声誉自我伤害行为”。他认为，加入海关联盟和单一市场将是恢复贸易增长并改善英国声誉、影响力和投资吸引力的关键步骤。

**Summary:**  
The article discusses a warning from the **British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)** about the need for the next UK government to improve trade relations with the EU post-Brexit, as businesses face increasing costs and complexities. The BCC director-general Shevaun Haviland emphasizes that tighter migration rules and new regulations are negatively impacting investment and growth in the country. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has expressed intentions to deepen trade and defense ties with the EU, but not rejoin the single market or allow freedom of movement.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: How have Brexit-related changes affected small businesses in particular?  
A1: The article highlights that new border checks on plant and animal products are imposing punitive costs, particularly affecting small firms exporting to the EU. These additional expenses make it harder for them to sell into the bloc, impacting their growth potential and profitability.

Q2: What specific changes does Shevaun Haviland suggest would most benefit businesses?  
A2: According to the article, easing migration rules is one of the key changes that could significantly help UK businesses. This change would facilitate the movement of people for work and ultimately benefit companies operating in or trading with the EU.

Q3: What are Sir Mike Rake's views on Brexit and its impact on the UK economy?  
A3: Sir Mike Rake, a former chair of BT Group, KPMG, and easyJet, considers Brexit as "the single biggest act of economic and reputational self-harm in our modern history." He believes that joining the customs union and single market would be crucial steps to restoring growth in trade and improving the UK's reputation, influence, and investability.
