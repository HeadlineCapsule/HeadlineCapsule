法国极右翼领袖承诺清理公共财政

**法国极右翼领袖承诺财政责任**

法国极右翼政党“国民联盟”（RN）领导人约旦·巴德拉（Jordan Bardella）致力于维持“合理”的开支计划并恢复该国的公共财务。这一承诺是在欧洲第二大经济体政治不确定性的背景下做出的，巴德拉旨在根据欧盟规则，将法国的赤字在2027年之前重新降至GDP的3%。

巴德拉批评了埃马纽埃尔·马克龙总统现任政府糟糕的公共财务状况，并概述了修复计划，包括在决定2025年预算措施之前对公共财务进行审计。 RN的经济计划包括降低退休年龄、取消30岁以下人群的所得税，以及降低能源、汽油和必需家庭用品的增值税。

为了弥补这些政策可能造成的潜在亏损，巴德拉提出通过关闭海上航运公司税收漏洞来筹集12亿欧元，减少法国对欧盟预算的贡献2亿欧元，并对能源公司的暴利征税额外筹集3亿欧元。 RN还计划废除马克龙标志性的养老金改革，将退休年龄从64岁降低到62岁。

巴德拉强调了加强法国工业基础、促进就业和减少繁文缛节的必要性，同时保持对俄罗斯这一多维威胁的反对立场。尽管巴德拉缺乏执政经验，但他的经济头脑似乎赢得了公众的信任，根据Ipsos为《金融时报》进行的民意调查，25%的受访者表示最相信RN能够在经济问题上做出正确的决定。

即将举行的提前选举将决定巴德拉是否能成为总理，因为他已经表示，他只会在国民议会拥有至少289个席位这一明确多数的情况下接受该职位。最有可能的结果是悬而未决的议会，但根据周日第一轮选举的意向投票，RN及其盟友目前处于领先地位。

 **France's Far-Right Chief Pledges Fiscal Responsibility**

Jordan Bardella, leader of France’s far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party, has committed to maintaining "reasonable" spending plans and restoring the country's public finances. The pledge comes amidst political uncertainty in Europe's second-largest economy, with Bardella aiming to reduce France’s deficit back to 3% of GDP by 202n7 as per EU rules.

Bardella criticized the current administration under President Emmanuel Macron for degraded public finances and outlined plans to repair them, including an audit of public finances before deciding on measures in preparation for the 2025 budget. The RN's economic plan includes lowering retirement age, eliminating income tax for those under 30, and reducing VAT on energy, petrol, and essential household goods.

To offset potential shortfalls from these policies, Bardella proposed raising €1.2bn by closing a tax loophole on maritime shipping companies, cutting France's contribution to the EU budget by €2bn, and taxing windfall profits of energy companies for an additional €3bn. The RN also plans to repeal Macron’s landmark pension reform that raises retirement age from amoan to 64 years old.

Bardella emphasized the need to strengthen France's industrial base, boost employment, and cut red tape while maintaining a stance against Russia as a multi-dimensional threat. Despite having little governing experience, Bardella’s economic acumen appears to be gaining public confidence with 25% of respondents expressing the most trust in RN's ability to make correct decisions on economic issues according to an Ipsos poll for the Financial Times.

The upcoming snap elections will determine if Bardella can become prime minister, as he has stated that he would only accept the position with a clear majority of at least 289 seats in the National Assembly. The most likely outcome is a hung parliament, but RN and its allies are currently leading in voting intentions for the first round of elections on Sunday.
