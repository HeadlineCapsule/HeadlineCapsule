日本顶级车企陷入扩大化的检测丑闻

# 摘要：
日本顶级汽车制造商，包括全球最大的汽车集团丰田和本田，因运输部在多间公司发现有缺陷的数据而陷入不断扩大的测试丑闻。调查发现了行人安全测试、行李移位测试、发动机控制软件等存在的问题。

## 关键点：
- 运输部的调查揭示了丰田、本田、马自达、鈴木和雅马哈发动机公司的测试数据造假问题。
- 豊田章男就该丑闻进行了第二次道歉；本田的三兵敏弘否认了故意伪造数据。
- 日本有六款车型暂停出货，丰田股价下跌 1.8%，马自达下跌 3%。
- 随着年度会议的临近，压力越来越大，托约达必须改革治理结构；代理顾问 ISS 和 Glass Lewis 建议投票反对他的重新任命，因为怀疑他会“照旧办事”。

## 影响：
该丑闻可能会导致更加严格的审查、当局对汽车制造商的突袭检查以及丰田治理结构的可能改革。股东对丰田章男的支持已经受到侵蚀，代理顾问建议在即将举行的年度会议上投票反对他的重新任命。

 **Article Summary:** Japan's top carmakers, including the world's largest auto group Toyota and Honda, are embroiled in a widening testing scandal involving faulty data uncovered by the transport ministry at several companies. The investigation found issues with pedestrian safety tests, luggage displacement tests, engine control software, among others.

**Key Points:**
- Transport ministry's probe reveals faulty testing data at Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki, and Yamaha Motor.
- Akio Toyoda apologizes for the scandal as a second time this year; Toshihiro Mibe of Honda denies intentional falsification of data.
- Six models have had shipments suspended in Japan, with Toyota's share price closing down 1.8% and Mazda falling by amo3%.
- Pressure mounts on Toyoda to overhaul governance structure amidst annual meeting; proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis recommend voting against his reappointment due to suspicions of "business as usual."

**Implications:** The scandal may lead to increased scrutiny, potential raids on carmakers by authorities, and a possible overhaul of Toyota's governance structure. Shareholder support for Akio Toyoda has already eroded, with proxy advisers recommending voting against his reappointment at the upcoming annual meeting.
