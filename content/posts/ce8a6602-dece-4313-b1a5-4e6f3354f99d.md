# 微软公司因 Microsoft Teams 可能面临欧盟的反垄断指控

**布鲁塞尔**正准备对微软提出反垄断指控，称该公司通过其** Microsoft Teams **产品的行为阻碍了视频会议软件市场的竞争。尽管微软最近做出让步，**解除 Teams 与其其他软件产品的捆绑**以避免监管行动，但这一进展依然发生。

**欧盟委员会**担心微软没有采取足够措施来确保公平的市场环境，竞争对手担心兼容性问题和定价策略可能会劝阻用户选择其他视频会议选项。还有人担心**缺乏数据可移植性**，使得 Teams 用户难以转向竞争产品。

这一案件代表了 2020 年** Slack**(现为 Salesforce 旗下公司)提出投诉的升级，标志着欧盟监管机构与微软之间长达十年的休战结束，此前欧盟在 2010 年代初曾对微软展开反垄断调查。如果被发现违反**欧盟竞争法**，微软可能面临高额罚款，罚款金额可能高达其全球年营业额的 10%。

指控的时间尚不确定，微软可能还会提供进一步的让步，或者**欧盟委员会**可能决定推迟或撤销指控。该公司表示将继续与欧盟委员会接触，探索有利于欧洲客户和开发者的解决方案。

# Microsoft set to face EU competition charges over Teams software 

**Brussels** is preparing to bring antitrust charges against Microsoft, alleging that the company is hindering competition in the videoconferencing software market through its practices with **Microsoft Teams**. This development comes despite Microsoft's recent efforts to **unbundle Teams** from its other software offerings as a concession to avoid regulatory action. 

The **European Commission** is concerned that Microsoft has not done enough to ensure a fair marketplace, with rivals worried about compatibility issues and pricing strategies that may discourage users from choosing alternative videoconferencing options. There are also concerns about the **lack of data portability**, making it challenging for Teams users to switch to competing products. 

This case represents an escalation of a complaint filed by **Slack** (now owned by Salesforce) in 2020 and marks the end of a decade-long truce between EU regulators and Microsoft following competition probes in the early 2010s. Microsoft could face significant fines if found to be in breach of **EU competition law**, with the potential for fines of up to 10% of its global annual turnover. 

The timing of the charges is uncertain, and Microsoft could still offer further concessions or the **European Commission** may decide to delay or scrap the charges. The company has stated that it will continue to engage with the commission and explore solutions that benefit customers and developers in Europe.
