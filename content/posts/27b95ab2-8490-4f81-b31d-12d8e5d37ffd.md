克里斯蒂娜·拉加德表示，只要有必要，欧洲央行就可以保持利率不变。

# 欧洲中央银行（ECB）可能连续多次会议维持利率不变

在最近与四家欧盟报社的采访中，欧洲中央银行（ECB）行长克里斯蒂娜·拉加德（Christine Lagarde）表示，尽管该银行上周启动了降低借贷成本的行动，但它可以连续多次会议维持利率不变。这一决定不是“预先确定的路径”的一部分，未来的利率变化将取决于劳动力成本的发展和收益吸收情况。

ECB最近将存款利率下调0.25个百分点至3.75%的决定引起了分析人士的关注，因为欧元区经济正在复苏，通货膨胀有所增加，工资以接近记录的速度上涨。预计美国联邦储备委员会和英格兰银行将在即将举行的会议上维持利率不变。

拉加德承认最近的数据本可以更好，但坚持认为降低利率的决定仍然是“合适的”。她强调，ECB将继续收紧货币政策周期，直到通货膨胀达到2%的目标，这预计要到明年年底才能实现。

 **Summary:**  
In a recent interview with four EU newspapers, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde stated that the bank could maintain interest rates for more than one meeting consecutively, despite initiating a reduction in borrowing costs last week. This decision is not part of a "pre-determined path," and future rate changes will depend on labor cost developments and earnings absorption.

The ECB's recent quarter-percentage-point deposit rate cut to 3.75% has raised eyebrows among analysts, as the Eurozone economy is recovering, inflation has increased, and wages are rising at a near-record pace. The US Federal Reserve and Bank of England are expected to maintain their interest rates in upcoming meetings.

Lagarde acknowledged that recent data could have been better but maintained that the rate cut decision was still "appropriate." She emphasized that the ECB would continue its tightening monetary policy cycle until inflation reaches its 2% target, which is not expected to happen until late next year.
