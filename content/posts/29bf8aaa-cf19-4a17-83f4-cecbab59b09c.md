哈维尔·米莱伊（Javier Milei）政府的经济改革方案获得参议院批准

**哈维尔·米莱伊政府的参议院批准**

阿根廷参议院以微弱多数通过了广泛的改革法案，在经济和政治压力不断增大的情况下，为阿根廷领导人赢得了关键的立法胜利。该法案包括投资激励措施、一些国有企业私有化计划以及总统对某些经济政策的权力扩大。

经过大幅修改的法案剔除了有争议的内容，例如国有航空公司私有化计划。它将在众议院进行最终投票，参议院的修正案可能会被推翻，但它成为法律的可能性非常大。总统办公室对这一胜利表示欢迎，称这标志着“迈向恢复伟大的第一步”。

一项旨在削减阿根廷财政赤字的单独法案很快将面临另一场激烈的投票。到目前为止，米莱伊依靠行政权力来削减公共开支，并通过法令放宽经济监管。分析人士呼吁他实施长期的立法改革，以恢复投资者信心，并将该国从年通货膨胀率达到289%的严重经济危机中拉出来。

在众议院遭受挫败之后，米莱伊的法案获得了批准，左翼和中间派议员违抗政府，投票支持增加养老金支出，占GDP的0.4%。尽管米莱伊承诺否决任何危及其“零财政赤字”计划的法案，但投票结果表明，反对派可能达到推翻否决所需的2/3多数。

市场分析师表示，周三的投票将提振阿根廷主权债券价格，并导致比索黑市汇率波动。然而，一些专家认为，尽管这项法案是米莱伊的一项成就，但它可能不足以消除人们对他在分裂的国会中实施计划的能力的怀疑。

 **Javier Milei's government secures senate approval**  

Argentina's Senate has narrowly approved a wide-ranging reform bill, granting the leader of Argentina a crucial legislative victory amidst rising economic and political pressures. The bill includes incentives for investments, plans to privatize some state companies, and an expansion of presidential powers over certain economic policies.

The heavily modified bill was stripped of controversial elements such as the plan to privatize a state-run airline. It will face a final vote in the lower house where senate amendments could be reversed but is highly likely to become law. The president's office hailed this victory, stating it marks "the first step towards recovering our greatness."

A separate bill aiming to trim Argentina's fiscal deficit faces another closely fought vote soon. Milei has so far relied on executive power to slash public spending and deregulate the economy by decree. Analysts have called for him to pass longer-term legislative reform to restore investor confidence and pull the country out of a severe economic crisis with annual inflation at amoeba289 percent.

The approval of Milei's bill comes after a bruising defeat in the lower house, where leftist and centrist lawmakers defied the government to approve an increase to pension spending that would cost 0.4% of GDP. While Milei has pledged to veto any bill that endangers his "zero fiscal deficit" plan, the vote suggested that the opposition could reach a two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.

Market analysts said Wednesday's vote would boost Argentina's sovereign bond prices and contribute to volatility in the peso's black market exchange rate. However, some experts believe that while this bill is an achievement for Milei, it may not be enough to dispel doubts about his ability to enact his plans amidst a fractured congress.
