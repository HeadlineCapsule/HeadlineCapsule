前Autonomy首席执行官迈克·林奇在美国欺诈审判中被无罪释放

# 前Autonomy首席执行官迈克·林奇（Mike Lynch）在美国欺诈审判中被判无罪

## 背景

迈克·林奇被指控在Autonomy公司110亿美元的销售前虚报收入，这家总部位于英国的软件公司随后被美国当局收购。指控基于他和其他人非法倒签合同、使用“循环交易”以及将不盈利的硬件销售作为高利润软件收入隐瞒等指控。

## 判决

在长达两个半月的审判后，陪审团裁定林奇14项电汇欺诈罪和一项阴谋罪全部不成立。旧金山的美国检察官办公室对这一判决表示承认和尊重。

## 反应

林奇对结果感到高兴，并期待返回英国。同时，林奇的律师批评政府“过度伸张”地起诉他。

## Autonomy的出售及后续

Autonomy的出售当时是英国科技界的一件大事。然而，HP在一年后将其投资减值88亿美元，并将50亿美元的损失归咎于Autonomy在交易前虚报的欺诈性收入。一家继任公司HPE正在通过英国的一项民事索赔寻求40亿美元的赔偿。

## 相关案件

Autonomy的前首席财务官Sushovan Hussain因类似的指控而被判欺诈罪，在美国服了五年刑。检察官认为，让Hussain成为核心人物，使Lynch能够在不留下任何纸迹的情况下行使控制权。

## Lynch的简介

迈克·林奇（Mike Lynch）在剑桥大学获得了博士学位，并在英国科技行业中崭露头角。他因企业服务而被授予OBE勋章，并于2006年被授予OBE勋章。在被无罪释放后，他创立了风险投资公司Invoke Capital。

 **Summary of Article:**  
Former Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch acquitted in US fraud trial; vindication after a long legal battle stemming from Silicon Valley's biggest fraud case. The jury found him not guilty on all counts, alongside Stephen Chamberlain, former VP of finance at Autonomy.

**Background:**  
Mike Lynch was accused of falsely inflating revenues at UK software company Autonomy ahead of its $11bn sale to Hewlett-Packard in cued by the US authorities. The charges were based on allegations that he and others illegally backdated contracts, used "round trip" deals, and hid unprofitable hardware sales as high-margin software revenue.

**Verdict:**  
After a two-and-a-half-month trial, the jury acquitted Lynch of 14 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. The US attorney's office in San Francisco acknowledged and respected the verdict.

**Reactions:**  
Lynch expressed his elation at the outcome and looked forward to returning to the UK, while Lynch's lawyers criticized the government for "profound over-reach" in pursuing the case against him.

**Autonomy Sale & Aftermath:**  
The sale of Autonomy was a significant event for the UK tech scene at that time. However, HP wrote down its investment by $8.8bn just one year later and blamed $5bn on what it claimed were fraudulent revenues raised by Autonomy before the deal. A successor company, HPE, is seeking $4bn in damages from Lynch through a civil claim in the UK.

**Other Related Cases:**  
Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, was found guilty of fraud over similar charges and served five years in prison in the US. Prosecutors argued that letting Hussain be seen as the central figure allowed Lynch to exercise control without leaving a paper trail back to himself.

**Lynch's Profile:**  
Mike Lynch, who completed his doctorate at Cambridge and rose to prominence in the UK tech industry, was awarded an OBE for services to enterprise in 2006. He founded venture capital group Invoke Capital after being acquitted of all charges.
