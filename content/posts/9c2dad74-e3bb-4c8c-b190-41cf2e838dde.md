# **欧洲央行警告称高债务水平使欧洲面临“不利冲击”的风险** 

**欧洲中央银行**（**ECB**）发布警告称，由于**公共债务水平高**，欧洲国家容易受到**不利冲击**的影响。欧洲央行半年一度的《金融稳定评估报告》强调，许多欧洲国家政府并没有扭转在**新冠肺炎疫情**期间以及**俄罗斯-乌克兰冲突**引发的能源危机中实施的**支持措施**。这引发了人们对“宽松的财政政策”及其对主权风险影响的担忧。欧洲央行还指出，如果因高债务和宽松的财政政策导致借贷成本上升，可能会产生“负面金融稳定影响”。

尽管欧洲央行预计未来几年经济活动将得到改善，得益于有韧性的劳动力市场和较低的通货膨胀，但它也承认生产率和增长持续面临挑战。此外，前景仍然脆弱，金融市场容易受到进一步冲击，特别是考虑到高债务水平和预算赤字。商业房地产市场正在经历急剧下滑，欧洲央行警告称，由于现金缓冲不足，房地产投资基金可能被迫出售资产。欧洲央行的警告与欧盟最新发布的经济预测不谋而合，该预测显示净借款下降，但欧元区各国债务水平持续居高不下。

# High debt levels put Europe at risk of ‘adverse shocks’, ECB warns

**European Central Bank** (ECB) has issued a warning regarding the vulnerability of European countries to **adverse shocks** due to their high public **debt levels**. The ECB's biannual financial stability review highlights that many European governments have not reversed the **support measures** implemented during the **COVID-19 pandemic** and the energy crisis triggered by the **Russia-Ukraine conflict**. This has led to concerns about "lax fiscal policies" and their impact on sovereign risk. The ECB also points out the potential for "negative financial stability effects" if borrowing costs rise due to high debt and lenient fiscal policies.

While the ECB expects economic activity to improve in the coming years, driven by resilient labor markets and lower inflation, it acknowledges persistent challenges to productivity and growth. Additionally, the outlook is fragile, with financial markets vulnerable to further shocks, especially considering elevated debt levels and budget deficits. Commercial property markets are experiencing a sharp downturn, and the ECB warns of potential "forced asset sales" by real estate investment funds due to insufficient cash buffers. The ECB's warning coincides with updated economic forecasts from the EU, indicating a decline in net borrowing but persistent high debt levels across the Eurozone.
