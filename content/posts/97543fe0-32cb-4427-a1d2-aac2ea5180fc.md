欧洲央行时隔五年首次降息

**欧洲中央银行（ECB）近五年来首次降息**

欧洲中央银行在近五年内首次降低利率，标志着其对抗通货膨胀的斗争中迈出了重要一步。将利率下调了0.25%，降至3.00%，以应对近期通货膨胀和工资增长的上涨。尽管做出了这一决定，但欧央行行长克里斯蒂娜·拉加德表示，进一步降低利率将取决于即将到来的数据。

欧央行管理委员会成员表示，由于这些经济因素，在7月的下一次会议上再次降息的可能性不大。该银行还警告不要提前承诺特定的利率路径，因为它预计通货膨胀率直到2025年底才可能降至2%的目标水平。

欧央会的决定是在欧元区通货膨胀率在今年5月首次加速达到2.6%之后做出的，这是由劳动力密集型服务业活动增加和第一季度近4.7%的谈判工资增长所驱动的。在拉加德宣布后，欧元略有走强，而对利率敏感的两年期德国邦德收益也小幅上涨。

欧央会将今年的增长预测从0.6%上调至0.9%，预计明年将增长1.4%，2026年将增长1.6%。这一举措巴西、墨西哥、智利、瑞士和瑞典等国中央银行今年早些时候也采取了类似的降息行动。

相比之下，由于价格压力比预期更持久，美国联邦储备委员会预计将维持利率在5.25%至5.5%的23年高位范围内，英国银行也不太可能从16年来的高位5.25%下调银行利率。

**摘要：**
欧洲中央银行近五年来首次降息，进一步降息将取决于即将到来的数据和通货膨胀趋势。在欧元区通货膨胀和工资增长双双上涨之际，欧央行做出了这一决定，而其他中央银行今年也实施了降息。

 **European Central Bank (ECB) Cuts Interest Rates for First Time in Almost Five Years**

The European Central Bank has reduced interest rates for the first time in nearly five years, marking a significant milestone in its battle against inflation. The quarter-point cut to 3.amoled by recent rises in inflation and wage growth. Despite this decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that further rate reductions would depend on incoming data.

The ECB's governing council members have indicated that another rate cut at the next meeting in July seems unlikely due to these economic factors. The bank has also cautioned against pre-committing to a specific rate path, as it expects inflation to remain above its 2% target until late 2025.

The ECB's decision comes after Eurozone inflation accelerated for the first time this year in May, reaching 2.6%, driven by increased labor-intensive services sector activity and a record high of nearly 4.7% negotiated wage growth in the first quarter. The euro strengthened slightly following Lagarde's announcement, while interest rate-sensitive two-year German Bund yields also edged higher.

The ECB has raised its growth forecast for this year from 0.6% to 0.9%, with expectations of 1.4% growth next year and 1.6% in 2026. This move follows similar rate cuts by central banks in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Switzerland, and Sweden earlier this year.

In contrast, the US Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its rates at a 23-year high range of 5.25% to 5.5%, as price pressures have proven more persistent than anticipated. The Bank of England is also considered unlikely to lower its bank rate from a 16-year high of 5.25%.

**Summary:**
The European Central Bank has cut interest rates for the first time in almost five years, with further reductions depending on incoming data and inflation trends. The ECB's decision comes amidst rising Eurozone inflation and wage growth, while other central banks have also implemented rate cuts this year.
