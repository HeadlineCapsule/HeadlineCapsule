# 芝加哥商品交易所计划推出比特币交易

**全球最大的期货交易所**——芝加哥商品交易所集团（CME Group）计划扩大其在**加密货币**市场的参与，推出**比特币现货交易**。目前，芝加哥商品交易所集团已经提供**比特币期货交易**，并希望借机扩大**华尔街基金经理**对比特币日益增长的兴趣。该计划尚未最终确定，但将允许投资者参与**基差交易**，这种策略涉及借入资金出售期货，同时购买基础资产。预计该交易所的现货交易业务将通过其位于瑞士的EBS货币交易场区进行，该场区对加密资产有着全面的监管。

芝加哥商品交易所此举反映了大型金融机构对**数字资产**的日益接受和认可，世界上一些最大的金融机构已向与比特币相关的交易所交易基金投资超100亿美元。该交易所本身也受益于这一新的兴趣，其比特币期货市场的规模已超过币安。然而，一位加密货币交易高管对芝加哥商品交易所集团的比特币交易业务的潜在结构提出质疑，认为将两个市场分开运营可能会影响其实现完全效率的能力。尽管如此，该高管强调了芝加哥商品交易所此举对数字资产交易基础设施认知所产生积极影响，这可能导致交易所未来接受**与加密货币相关的抵押品**。

# Futures exchange CME plans to launch bitcoin trading 

CME Group, the **world's largest futures exchange**, is planning to expand its involvement in the **cryptocurrency** market by introducing **spot bitcoin trading**. This development comes as CME already offers **bitcoin futures trading** and sees an opportunity to capitalize on the growing interest in bitcoin from Wall Street money managers. The plan, which is not yet finalized, would allow investors to engage in **basis trades**, a strategy that involves borrowing to sell futures while buying the underlying asset. CME's potential spot trading business is expected to be run through its EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, which has comprehensive regulations for crypto assets. This move by CME reflects the increasing comfort and acceptance of **digital assets** by large financial institutions, with some of the world's biggest names investing over $10 billion into bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds. The exchange itself has benefited from this renewed interest, overtaking Binance as the largest bitcoin futures market. However, one crypto trading executive questioned the potential structure of CME's bitcoin trading business, suggesting that operating as two separate markets might hinder its ability to achieve full efficiency. Nonetheless, the executive highlighted the positive impact of CME's move on the perception of digital asset trading infrastructure, which could lead to exchanges accepting **crypto-related collateral** in the future.
