# **气候行动 100+** 能赢回叛逃者吗？

**气候行动 100+** 是一个投资者联盟，推动企业解决与**气候相关**的风险，最近几个月，它遭遇了众多主要金融机构的退出浪潮，包括摩根大通资产管理、道富环球投资管理和贝莱德。然而，该团体的指导委员会主席迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）仍对其价值主张充满信心，并质疑离开成员的逻辑，暗示他们可能违反了**受托责任**。科恩同时也是美国最大的养老基金**加州公务员退休基金（Calpers）**首席投资官的幕僚长，他强调了会员资格的益处，包括气候相关的研究和接触机会。他认为，叛逃者可能会意识到自己错过了这些优势，并重新考虑他们的退出决定。这篇文章还探讨了**比特币矿工**如何为**能源转型**做出贡献，以及白宫提高中国商品关税的影响，包括电动汽车和太阳能电池。

最近从气候行动 100+的退出发生在美国对**环境、社会和公司治理（ESG）**议程的政治反弹背景下，一些团体选择专注于与投资组合公司接触的独立方法，并关注与美国要求冲突的潜在冲突，即要符合客户的长远经济利益。然而，随着主要参与者仍致力于该团体以及可能的协同优势，此举对该联盟和更广泛的 ESG 运动造成的未来影响仍有待观察。

# Can Climate Action 100+ Bring Back its Defectors? 

**Climate Action 100+**, an investor coalition pushing companies to address **climate-related risks**, has seen a wave of departures from major financial institutions in recent months, including JPMorgan Asset Management, State Street Global Advisors, and BlackRock. Despite this, the group's steering committee chair, Michael Cohen, remains confident in its value proposition and questions the logic of the departing members, suggesting a potential breach of their **fiduciary duty**. Cohen, who is also chief of staff to the CIO at **Calpers**, the largest US pension fund, highlights the benefits of membership, including climate-related research and engagement opportunities. He believes that defectors may eventually realize the advantages they are missing out on and reconsider their decision to leave. The article also explores the potential for **bitcoin miners** to contribute to the **energy transition** and the impact of the White House's tariff increases on Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and solar cells.

The recent exodus from Climate Action 100+ has been set against a backdrop of political backlash against the **ESG** agenda, with some groups choosing to focus on independent approaches to portfolio company engagement and concerns over potential conflicts with US requirements to act in clients' long-term economic interests. However, with major players still committed to the group and the potential for collaborative advantages, the future impact on the coalition and the wider ESG movement remains to be seen.
