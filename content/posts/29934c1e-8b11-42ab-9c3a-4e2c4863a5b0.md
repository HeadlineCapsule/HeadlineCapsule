# 英国法院审理一起涉嫌针对英国犹太社区的袭击阴谋

两名男子，**瓦利德·萨达维**（**Walid Saadaoui**）和**阿马尔·侯赛因**（**Amar Hussein**），被控**准备恐怖主义行为**和策划对英国**西北部**，尤其是**大曼彻斯特**地区**犹太社区**的**枪支袭击**。据称，这两人计划使用**自动武器**不仅针对犹太人，还针对**执法人员**和**军事人员**。萨达维的兄弟，**比勒尔**（**Bilel**），也被控**未披露有关该阴谋的信息**，因为他认为他知道他兄弟的意图并做了准备。这三人都在西敏市地方法院出庭，并被还押候审，定于5月24日在伦敦的老贝利法院举行进一步听证会。

在**哈马斯最近对以色列的袭击**和随后的**以色列在加沙的军事行动**之后，这一案件引发了人们对英国社区安全和紧张局势的担忧，尤其是犹太社区。这些逮捕和指控是警察和安全组织之间协作努力的结果，重点是确保所有公民的安全，并特别满足犹太社区的安全需求，因为他们在这个时候表达了加强保护的需求。

# Court hears of alleged plot to attack UK Jewish community 

**Two men**, **Walid Saadaoui** and **Amar Hussein**, have been **charged with preparing terrorist acts** and **plotting a firearms attack** on the **Jewish community** in **north-west England**, with a particular focus on **Greater Manchester**. The pair allegedly planned to use **automatic weapons** to target not only Jewish individuals but also **law enforcement** and **military personnel**. Saadaoui's brother, **Bilel**, has been charged with **failing to disclose information** about the plot, as it is believed he knew of his brother's intentions and made preparations. All three men appeared at **Westminster Magistrates' Court** and were **remanded in custody**, with a further hearing scheduled for **May 24** at the **Old Bailey** in London. 

This case has raised concerns about community safety and tensions in the UK, especially within the Jewish community, following the recent **Hamas attack on Israel** and subsequent **Israeli military action in Gaza**. The arrests and charges are a result of a collaborative effort between police and security organizations, with a focus on ensuring the safety of all citizens, and specifically addressing the security needs of the Jewish community, which has expressed a need for heightened protection during this time.
