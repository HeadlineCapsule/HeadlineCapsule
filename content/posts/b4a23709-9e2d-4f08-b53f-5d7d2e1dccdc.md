# 欧洲私募股权集团被迫延长持有资产 

欧洲**私募股权** 公司在其试图将现金返还投资者时遇到了挑战，因为他们被迫延长持有资产。 欧洲收购集团出售的公司的平均所有权期限已近六年，超过了典型的三年到五年的持有期。 这一延长期可归因于各种因素，包括 **新冠肺炎疫情**、连续的**利率**上涨、**通货膨胀**和**地缘政治不稳定**。 该行业正在应对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰造成的高利率、通胀和供应链中断的三重打击。

传统的 **收购模式** 面临压力，因为公司在低利率环境下难以退出行业繁荣期间进行的投资。 连续的加息增加了借贷成本，使得公司对相互收购资产更为谨慎。 另一个退出渠道是，**首次公开募股（IPO）**市场平静，这也加剧了这种情况。 从全球来看，私募股权公司持有未售出公司的数量达到创纪录水平。

业内高管和顾问指出，公司在收购时变得更加谨慎，令人疑惑的是，在返还投资者本金的同时，它们将如何出售增长较慢和利润率较低的公司。 研究表明，持有的时间较长的公司往往会经历较低的收入增长率。 此外，一些企业在出售时面临挑战，因为买卖双方在估值方面存在分歧。

为了管理他们的投资组合，私募股权集团正在采用各种策略，例如创建“延续”基金，将资产转移到一个新的基金，允许投资者退出。 然而，整体环境使得公司难以退出某些投资，他们也倾向于延长持有最佳资产的时间。

# European private equity groups forced to keep assets longer

European **private equity** firms are facing challenges in returning cash to investors as they are forced to hold assets for extended periods. The average ownership duration of companies sold by European buyout groups has increased to nearly six years, exceeding the typical holding period of three to five years. This prolongation is attributed to various factors, including the impact of the **COVID-19** pandemic, successive **interest rate** hikes, high **inflation**, and **geopolitical instability**. The industry is navigating a triple whammy of high-interest rates, inflation, and supply chain disruptions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

The traditional **buyout model** is under pressure, with firms struggling to exit investments made during the industry's boom in a low-interest-rate environment. Successive rate rises have increased borrowing costs, making firms more cautious about acquiring assets from each other. The quiet **IPO market**, another exit route, has also contributed to the situation. Globally, private equity firms are holding a record number of unsold companies. 

Industry executives and advisers note that firms are becoming more selective in their acquisitions, raising questions about how they will sell companies with slower growth and lower profit margins while still returning capital to investors. The research highlights that companies held for longer periods tend to experience lower revenue growth rates. Additionally, some businesses have faced challenges in selling due to valuation disagreements between buyers and sellers. 

To manage their portfolios, private equity groups are employing strategies such as creating "continuation" funds, where assets are transferred to a new fund, allowing investors to cash out. However, the overall environment has made it difficult for firms to exit some investments, and they are also choosing to hold onto their best assets for longer.
