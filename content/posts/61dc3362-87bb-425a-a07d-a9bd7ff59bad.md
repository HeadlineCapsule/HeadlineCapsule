四天工作制比混合办公更容易，原子银行首席执行官称

# Atom 银行的四天工作制：降低员工流失和病假率

英国数字银行 Atom 自 2021 年实施四天工作制以来，员工流失和病假率下降。该银行首席执行官 Mark Mullen 表示，这一变化比应对疫情后的灵活工作安排“挑战要小得多”。

**关键点：**

- Atom 银行于 2021 年为所有员工引入了每周 34 小时的四天工作制，而没有削减工资。
- 自实施该政策以来，该银行的员工流失和病假率下降。
- Mullen 认为，规划和实施缩短的工作周带来了明确的预期，与可能导致经理“害怕”要求员工返回办公室的灵活工作模式不同。
- Atom 银行在 2023 年报告了其首次年度税前利润 700 万英镑，其贷款余额增长了 40%，住宅抵押贷款余额增长了 55%。
- 该银行于 2016 年作为英国首批基于应用程序的银行之一推出，不提供活期存款账户，而是专注于通过其贷款审批技术为客户提供更好的利率。

**结论：**

Atom 银行的四天工作制已证明是减少员工流失和病假的成功策略，同时为银行及其员工提供了明确的预期。该银行继续专注于增长，强调提供优质服务，而不是像竞争对手那样快速扩张。

 **Atom Bank's Four-Day Work Week: Lower Staff Attrition and Sickness**

The UK digital bank, Atom, has experienced lower staff attrition and sickness since implementing a four-day work week in 2021. The CEO of the bank, Mark Mullen, stated that this change was "considerably less challenging" than navigating post-pandemic flexible working arrangements.

**Key Points:**

- Atom Bank introduced a four-day work week with 34 hours for all employees without cutting pay in 2021.
- The bank has seen lower staff attrition and sickness since the change was implemented.
- Mullen believes that planning and implementing the shorter working week came with clear expectations, unlike flexible working patterns which may lead to managers being "afraid" of asking employees to come back to the office.
- Atom Bank reported its first annual pre-tax profit of £7mn in 2cu2023 after increasing its loan book by 40% and experiencing a 55% increase in residential mortgage balances.
- The bank, launched in 2016 as one of the UK's first app-based banks, does not offer current accounts but focuses on providing customers with better interest rates through its technology for loan underwriting.

**Conclusion:**
Atom Bank's four-day work week has proven to be a successful strategy in reducing staff attrition and sickness while maintaining clear expectations for both the bank and its employees. The bank continues to focus on growth, with an emphasis on providing outstanding services rather than expanding rapidly like competitors.
