印度贾家族成员因剥削家庭佣工被判入狱

# 印度亿万富翁家族被瑞士法院判刑

日内瓦一家法院裁定，印度亿万富翁家族希德贾（Hinduja）家族的四名成员利用其国内员工的弱点并对其进行剥削。法院认为他们犯有严重的就业犯罪，但驳回了人口贩运指控。

这些家庭佣工大多是文盲，从印度直接被送往瑞士，并在希德贾家族的日内瓦豪宅中遭受恶劣待遇。希德贾家族的成员被判处长期监禁：普拉卡什（Prakash）和卡马尔（Kamal）各被判入狱四年半，阿贾伊（Ajay）和纳姆拉塔（Namrata）被判入狱四年。

法院裁定，尽管这些员工在印度时知道他们签署的条款，但他们的弱点却因语言障碍、没收护照和不规则的付款时间表而被利用。希德贾家族律师对判决结果表示失望，但强调已根据瑞士法律提起上诉。

希德贾集团是一家多元化跨国公司，涉足汽车、石化、银行和军工等多个行业。普拉卡什定居瑞士，而他的哥哥戈皮昌（Gopichand）和斯里昌（Srichand）则在伦敦建立了该集团的运营中心。

日内瓦检察官指控家族成员将员工当作契约仆人对待，让他们在条件恶劣的别墅中生活，支付的工资不到他们根据瑞士法律应得的十分之一，并通过没收护照限制他们的个人自由。

希德贾家族在审判中否认了这些指控，称他们的员工就像“家人一样”。上周，代表员工提起的民事诉讼以未披露的金额达成和解。

 **Summary:**  
Four members of the multi-billionaire Hinduja clan, including Prakash Hinduja and his family, were convicted by a court in Geneva for exploiting their domestic staff. The court found them guilty of serious employment offences related to Indian staff but cleared them of human trafficking charges.

The domestic workers, mostly illiterate, had been flown from India directly to Switzerland and subjected to harsh conditions at the family's palatial home in Geneva. The Hindujas were sentenced to lengthy jail terms: Prakash and Kamal received four-and-a-half years each, while Ajay and Namrata got a four-year sentence.

The court ruled that although the employees had known the terms they signed up for in India, their vulnerabilities were exploited due to language barriers, confiscation of passports, and irregular payment schedules. The Hinduja family's lawyer expressed disappointment with the verdict but emphasized that an appeal process was already filed under Swiss law.

The Hinduja Group is a multinnational conglomerate with interests in various industries such as cars, petrochemicals, banking, and armaments. Prakash settled in Switzerland while his older brothers Gopichand and Srichand established the group's center of operations in London.

Geneva’s public prosecutor accused the family members of treating their employees as indentured servants, keeping them trapped at a villa with substandard living conditions, paying less than one-tenth of what they were entitled to under Swiss law, and restricting personal freedom by confiscating passports.

The Hinduja family denied these allegations during the trial, stating that their staff members had been like "members of the family." A civil case brought against them on behalf of their staff was settled for an undisclosed sum last week.
