曼彻斯特机场集团寻求国际扩张

**曼彻斯特机场集团（MAG）** 在从航空业疫情影响中恢复的同时，寻求国际扩张。该公司由曼彻斯特市议会、IFM全球基础设施基金等拥有，旨在通过商业协议管理海外机场设施，然后再考虑购买另一个枢纽。

**首席执行官Ken O’Toole** 表示有兴趣利用国家所有机场在疫情后改造运营所带来的机会。与更具攻击性的基础设施基金相比，MAG的公私营混合所有制结构被视为与世界各国政府建立战略长期伙伴关系的优势。

该公司计划在未来五年内在英国三个机场（曼彻斯特、伦敦斯坦斯特德和东米德兰兹）投资20亿英镑，以提高其乘客容量。O’Toole希望英国未来政府将继续支持机场扩张，同时符合航空业去碳化计划中规定的净零气候目标。

在票价方面，预计在经历了两年由于需求强劲和飞机短缺而导致的大幅上涨后，票价将趋于稳定。这一观点得到了包括瑞安航空在内的几家欧洲航空公司的支持，他们计划今年夏天的票价与去年相比保持平稳或略有增长，而去年的增长预测为10%。

 **Manchester Airports Group (MAG)** seeks international expansion as it recovers from the pandemic's impact on the aviation industry. The company, owned by Manchester City Council and IFM Global Infrastructure Fund among others, aims to manage airport facilities overseas through commercial deals before considering purchasing another hub.

**CEO Ken O’Toole** expressed interest in capitalizing on opportunities presented by state-owned airports looking to revamp operations post-pandemic. MAG's public-private ownership structure is seen as an advantage for strategic long-term partnerships with governments worldwide, compared to more aggressive infrastructure funds.

The company plans to invest £2bn across its three UK airports (Manchester, London Stansted, and East Midlands) over the next five years, increasing their passenger capacities. O’Toole hopes that the future UK government will continue supporting airport expansion while aligning with net zero climate targets as per the aviation industry's decarbonization plan backed by the government in 2022.

In terms of ticket prices, a stabilization is expected following two years of sharp increases due to strong demand and aircraft shortages. This view is supported by several European airlines, including Ryanair, which plans for flat or modestly increased fares this summer compared to last year's 10% increase forecast.
