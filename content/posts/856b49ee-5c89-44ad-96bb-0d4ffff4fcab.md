# 饱受批评的英国水公司抨击监管系统“繁琐复杂”

英国水公司因处理 **污染**、**污水排放** 和 **水泄漏问题** 而面临严格的审查和批评。近日，水行业游说团体 **Water UK** 指责监管机构 **Ofwat** 创建了一个复杂而僵化的监管框架，阻碍了基础设施所急需的投资。

**Water UK** 声称，**Ofwat** 更看重低水费和运营效率，而不是关键的基础设施改善，这导致溢流问题可能推迟七年才能解决。该游说团体还认为，当前系统未能服务公众，污水和泄漏问题持续存在就是证明。

随着 6 月将出台关于水费上涨的草案，水公司要求提高三分之一的水费，以维持服务和资助改进。然而，**Ofwat** 陷入了两难的境地：一方面是水公司的要求，另一方面则是生活成本危机、**客户愤怒情绪高涨** 和 **偿债担忧** 带来的现实问题。英国最大的水公司 **Thames Water** 面临财务困境，债务负担沉重，可能需要暂时重新国有化，这进一步加剧了当前的局势。

**Water UK** 指责监管机构建立了过于复杂的框架，并指出 **Ofwat** 要求的过度文件记录和不断的查询就是繁琐流程的证据。作为回应，**Ofwat** 为自己的严格审查辩护，称这涉及大量客户资金，因此有必要提出严苛的挑战。该监管机构还反驳了阻碍投资的说法，坚称其支持所有水公司的环保项目，并允许他们增加额外支出。

在公众不满和环境担忧日益加剧的背景下，水公司与监管机构之间的争执正在展开，这也为未来几个月的关键决策期奠定了基础。

# Under-fire UK water companies lash out at ‘labyrinthine’ regulatory system

Water companies in the UK are facing intense scrutiny and criticism for their handling of **pollution**, **sewage outflows**, and **water leakage issues**. In a recent development, **Water UK**, the industry lobby group, has criticized the regulator, **Ofwat**, for creating a complex and inflexible regulatory framework that hinders much-needed investment in infrastructure. 

**Water UK** claims that **Ofwat** prioritizes low bills and operational efficiency over critical infrastructure improvements, leading to a potential seven-year delay in addressing overflow issues. The lobby group also argues that the current system is failing the public, as evident by the ongoing challenges with sewage and leakage. 

With a draft decision on bill increases looming in June, water companies are requesting a one-third hike to maintain services and fund improvements. However, **Ofwat** is caught between these demands and the reality of a **cost-of-living crisis**, as well as rising **customer fury** and **concerns over debt servicing**. The situation is further exacerbated by the financial struggles of **Thames Water**, the largest water company, which may require temporary renationalization due to its massive debt burden. 

**Water UK** blames the regulator for creating an overly complex framework, highlighting the excessive documentation and constant queries from **Ofwat** as evidence of a cumbersome process. In response, **Ofwat** defends its rigorous scrutiny, citing the significant amount of customer money involved and the necessity for robust challenges. The regulator also refutes claims of blocking investment, asserting that it has supported all companies' environmental projects and allowed them to bring forward additional expenditure. 

This dispute between water companies and their regulator unfolds against a backdrop of increasing public dissatisfaction and environmental concerns, setting the stage for a critical decision-making period in the coming months.
