## **沙特** 王国对**西方咨询公司**的高度依赖引发当地疑虑

**沙特阿拉伯** 在经济改革和重大项目上严重依赖**西方咨询公司**，这引发了一些官员和公民对**外来者**在该国扮演角色的不安情绪。沙特各部委，尤其是**能源部**，向来依赖于**德勤、安永、毕马威和普华永道**等公司以及专业战略咨询公司的咨询顾问，这种依赖程度已经导致不满和过度依赖的感觉。自穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼王储于 2016 年启动雄心勃勃的经济改革计划**《2030 愿景》**以来，这一趋势愈发明显，沙特咨询市场在 2022 年达到 30 亿美元。

**利雅得**与这些公司之间的联系已受到**华盛顿**的关注，国会听证会质疑这些公司为沙特王国所做的工作。尽管人们对成本和过度影响感到不满，但咨询公司辩称，他们的参与有助于为沙特的巨额项目支出提供合理依据。这种关系也对咨询行业有利，沙特市场的增长率高于全球平均水平。然而，近期油价下跌导致成本控制成为关注焦点，使得沙特经济重点和项目的管理成为该国及其咨询合作伙伴面临的关键问题。

# Consulting firms' grip on Saudi economy sparks local misgivings 

**Saudi Arabia's** heavy reliance on **western consulting firms** to steer its economic reforms and major projects has sparked concerns among some officials and citizens about the role of **outsiders** in running the kingdom. The country's ministries, particularly the **energy ministry**, have historically depended on consultants from firms like **Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC**, as well as specialist strategy firms, to a degree that has led to **discontent and a sense of over-dependence**. This trend has intensified since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's launch of an ambitious economic reform plan, **Vision 2030**, in 2016, with the kingdom's consultancy market reaching $3 billion in 2022. 

Riyadh's engagement with these firms has drawn scrutiny in **Washington**, with congressional hearings questioning their work for the kingdom. Despite grumblings about the costs and the perception of excessive influence, consultants argue that their involvement helps **rationalize** Saudi Arabia's massive project expenditures. The relationship is also beneficial for the consulting industry, with the Saudi market experiencing significant growth compared to global averages. However, the recent decline in oil prices has heightened the focus on **cost control**, making the management of Saudi Arabia's economic priorities and projects a critical concern for both the kingdom and its consulting partners.
