FirstFT：苏纳克宣布英国7月4日大选，威斯敏斯特震惊。

## 世界新闻简讯：

1. **台积电**（TSMC），全球最大的芯片代工企业，去年第四季度净利润同比增长23%，达到 157 亿美元。公司将这一增长归功于其用于智能手机和游戏机的先进芯片的强劲需求和高价格。台积电计划继续以同样的速度推出更强大的芯片。

2. **欧盟**正计划收紧对白俄罗斯的制裁，旨在阻止俄罗斯通过该国进口西方豪华汽车。此举是对白俄罗斯支持莫斯科入侵乌克兰的回应，目的是尽量减少规避风险。

3. 雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）家族的办公室于 2021 年以约 1900 万美元的价格在新加坡购置了两栋“店屋”，表明亿万富翁对该城邦遗产房产的兴趣。这笔购买发生在疫情期间，当时桥水联合公司创始人宣布向亚洲转移。

4. 根据本月初美联储最后一次会议的纪要，如果通胀变得更加激进，一些美国联邦储备委员会官员表示愿意进一步加息。然而，随着近几个月通胀数据降温，加息的前景已经减弱。

5. 在澳大利亚和美国报告了新的禽流感病例后，疫苗制造商莫德纳（Moderna）和 BioNTech 的股价飙升。卫生部门确认了人类感染 H5N1 型禽流感的病例，引发了对更广泛传播的担忧。这是在越来越多的证据将超加工食品消费与肥胖、癌症和糖尿病联系起来的同时发生的。

6. **挪威石油基金**面临抗议者的压力，要求其从以色列撤资，这给世界上最大的主权财富基金带来了困境。与此同时，在选举被认为只会有利于精英的背景下，南非不满现状的年轻选民正在远离执政的非洲国民大会党。

7. 威廉·鲁托（William Ruto）总统将于今天作为16年来首位到访美国的非洲领导人进行国事访问，这突显了美肯关系及其局限性。与此同时，在英國，萨钦·德夫·杜加尔（Sachin Dev Duggal）坎坷的职业生涯打造了该国最热门的技术独角兽之一 Builder.ai。

8. 西班牙去年吸引了超过 8500 万游客，几乎是其人口的两倍，它正努力成为世界上首屈一指的旅游目的地。然而，游客数量激增也引发了愤怒的“恐旅游症”爆发。在曼彻斯特，作家简奈特·温特森（Jeanette Winterson）在其出生地庆祝了那里在古代历史与现代创新交融背景下的精神和活力。

1. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, reported a 23% increase in net profit for Q4 of last year, reaching $15.7bn. The company attributes this growth to strong demand and high prices for its advanced chips used in smartphones and gaming consoles. TSMC plans to continue rolling out more powerful chips at the same pace.
2. The European Union is planning to tighten sanctions on Belarus, aiming to stop Russia from importing western luxury cars via the country. This move comes as a response to Belarus's support of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and seeks to minimize the risk of circumvention.
3. Ray Dalio’s family office purchased two "shophouses" in Singapore for about $19mn in 2021, signaling billionaires' interest in heritage properties within the city-state. The purchase was made during the pandemic as the founder of Bridgewater Associates announced his move to Asia.
4. Some US Federal Reserve officials have indicated a willingness to raise interest rates further if inflation becomes more aggressive, according to minutes from their last meeting at the start of this month. However, prospects for a rate rise have fallen since cooler-than-expected inflation data was released in recent months.
5. Shares in vaccine makers such as Moderna and BioNTech rose sharply after new bird flu cases were reported in Australia and the US. Health authorities confirmed human H5N1 infection cases, raising fears of wider transmission. This comes amidst a growing body of evidence linking ultra-processed food consumption to obesity, cancer, and diabetes.
6. Norway's oil fund faces pressure from protesters demanding divestment from Israel, presenting a dilemma for the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Meanwhile, South Africa sees disenchanted young voters turning away from the ruling African National Congress ahead of elections perceived as benefiting only the elite.
7. President William Ruto will become the first African leader in 16 years to be received on a state visit by Washington today, highlighting US-Kenya ties and their limits. In Britain, Sachin Dev Duggal's tumultuous career is behind one of the country’s hottest tech unicorns, Builder.ai.
8. Spain attracted over 85 million tourists last year, nearly double its population, as it competed to become the world's top tourist destination. However, this surge in visitors has provoked angry outbreaks of "tourism-phobia." In Manchester, writer Jeanette Winterson celebrates her birthplace’s spirit and energy amidst a blend of ancient history and modern innovation.
