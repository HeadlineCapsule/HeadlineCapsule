五角大楼负责人试图通过访问金边吸引柬埔寨远离中国

五角大楼负责人劳埃德·奥斯汀（Lloyd Austin）下月将访问柬埔寨，这是华盛顿努力接触该国新总理、受过美国教育的洪马尼（Hun Manet）的一部分。目标是使柬埔寨远离中国，并促进与美国更紧密的联系。这是在人们担心中国正在柬埔寨西哈努克省雷姆（Ream）建造海军基地以及中国“一带一路”倡议（BRI）资金减少的情况下进行的。

奥斯汀访问期间将与总理洪马尼会面，他于2023年8月接替他的父亲、前领导人洪森。他毕业于西点军校和纽约大学。美国希望像洪马尼这样的年轻一代领导人的出现会使柬埔寨更倾向于与美国密切合作。

奥斯汀的访问也恰逢他出席在新加坡举行的香格里拉对话防务论坛，在那里他将讨论印太地区的挑战，并与中国国防部长东军举行会议。五角大楼负责人预计将表达对中国在台湾周围和与南中国海第二托马斯礁相关的问题上采取强硬军事行动的担忧。

问题：

1. 总理洪马尼在美国的教育背景可能会如何影响柬埔寨的外交政策，尤其是在其与中国的关系方面？

   答案：作为在西点军校和纽约大学接受过教育的人，总理洪马尼可能对印太地区的地缘平衡有更微妙的理解。这可能导致柬埔寨重新评估其外交政策优先事项，并有可能从中国转向与美国和其他区域盟友建立更紧密的联系。

2. 中国“一带一路”倡议（BRI）资金减少对其与柬埔寨等国家的关系有何影响？

   答案：对“一带一路”倡议的资助减少可能会削弱中国在东南亚的影响力，因为它可能无法为基础设施项目提供财务支持。这为其他区域大国和国际组织提供了介入并提供替代性投资来源的机会，从而导致柬埔寨重新评估其外交政策优先事项及其与中国的结盟。

3. 五角大楼负责人香格里拉对话防务论坛上的讨论可能会如何影响美国与其他印太国家的关系？

   答案：五角大楼负责人在香格里拉对话上的讲话和接触可能会加强现有的联盟和伙伴关系，并促进建立新的联盟。通过概述一种涉及美国盟友之间更密切合作的关系“格子”安全架构，奥斯汀可能会鼓励该地区在应对共同挑战（例如中国在台湾周围的军事行动以及南中国海领土争端）方面进行更大的区域合作。这可能导致加强集体安全措施，并使印太国家采取更加统一的方法来维护该地区的稳定与和平。

## Summary:
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin is set to visit Cambodia next month as part of an effort by Washington to engage the country's new American-educuted Prime Minister, Hun Manet. The goal is to distance Cambodia from China and foster closer ties with the US. This comes amid concerns about a Chinese naval base being built at Ream in Cambodia and reduced funding for China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

During his visit, Austin will meet with Prime Minister Hun Manet, who succeeded his father, former leader Hun Sen, in August 2023. He graduated from West Point and New York University. The US hopes that the emergence of a new generation of leaders like Hun Manet will make Cambodia more inclined to work closely with Washington.

Austin's visit also coincides with his attendance at the Shangri-La Dialogue defence forum in Singapore, where he will discuss challenges in the Indo-Pacific and hold a meeting with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun. The Pentagon chief is expected to express concerns about China's assertive military activity around Taiwan and issues related to the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How might Prime Minister Hun Manet's American education influence Cambodia's foreign policy, particularly regarding its relationship with China?
A1: As an individual educated at West Point and New York University, Prime Minister Hun Manet may have a more nuanced understanding of the geopolebalance in the Indo-Pacific region. This could lead to a reassessment of Cambodia's foreign policy priorities, potentially resulting in a shift away from China towards closer ties with the US and other regional allies.

Q2: What are the implications of reduced funding for China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on its relationships with countries like Cambodia?
A2: Reduced funding for the BRI could weaken China's influence in Southeast Asia, as it may be less able to provide financial support for infrastructure projects. This creates an opportunity for other regional powers and international organizations to step in and offer alternative sources of investment, potentially leading to a reevaluation of Cambodia's foreign policy priorities and alignment with China.

Q3: How might the Pentagon chief's discussions at the Shangri-La Dialogue defence forum impact US relations with other countries in the Indo-Pacific region?
A3: The Pentagon chief's speeches and engagements at the Shangri-La Dialogue could strengthen existing alliances and partnerships, as well as foster new ones. By outlining a "latticed" security architecture that involves US allies working more closely with each other, Austin may encourage greater regional cooperation in addressing shared challenges such as China's assertive military activity around Taiwan and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. This could lead to enhanced collective security measures and a more unified approach among Indo-Pacific nations towards maintaining stability and peace in the region.
