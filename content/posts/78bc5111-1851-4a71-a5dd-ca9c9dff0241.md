本尼·甘茨因加沙问题辞职

**以色列中间派政客本尼·甘茨（Benny Gantz）辞职，并呼吁提前举行选举。** 他指责总理内塔尼亚胡在对加沙的哈马斯战争中处理不当，称“由于政治考虑，重大的战略决策遇到犹豫和拖延。” 甘茨支持美国主导的释放以色列人质的努力，并支持对10月7日袭击失败进行调查。

甘茨离开后，内塔尼亚胡的联盟与极右翼和极端宗教团体之间出现紧张局势已久，双方在战争目标上存在分歧，包括摧毁哈马斯并确保人质获释。尽管甘茨的辞职不会自动推翻政府或触发2026年之前的选举，但这可能会改变内塔尼亚胡联盟内的动态。

反对党政治家欢迎甘茨的离开，认为这是组建新政府的机会，以恢复安全、带回人质、重建经济并改善以色列的国际地位。民调显示，如果今天举行选举，甘茨的统一党将赢得最多的选票。

**关键点：**
- 甘茨因内塔尼亚胡对加沙战争的管理而辞职
- 呼吁提前举行选举，批评战略决策中的政治犹豫
- 支持美国主导的人质获释努力和对10月8日袭击失败的调查
- 甘茨的离开可能会改变内塔尼亚胡联盟内的动态，尽管不会自动推翻政府或触发2026年之前的选举。

 **Summary of Article:**

Centrist politician Benny Gantz resigns from Israel's emergency government and calls for early elections. He accuses Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of mishandling the war against Hamas in Gaza, stating that "fateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political consideraturality." Gantz supports a US-led push to free Israeli hostages held by Hamas and backs an inquiry into failures surrounding the October 7 attack.

Gantz's departure follows months of tensions within Netanyahu's coalition with far-right and ultrareligious groups over war goals, including destroying Hamas and securing hostage release. Despite Gantz's resignation not automatically toppling the government or triggering elections before 2026, it is likely to change dynamics within Netanyahu's coalition.

Opposition politicians welcome Gantz's departure as an opportunity for a new government that will restore security, bring hostages home, rebuild the economy and improve Israel's international standing. Polls suggest that if elections were held today, Gantz's National Unity party would win the most votes.

**Key Points:**
- Benny Gantz resigns from Israel's emergency government over Gaza war management by Netanyahu
- Calls for early elections and criticizes political hesitancy in strategic decisions
- Supports US-led hostage release efforts and inquiry into October eighth attack failures
- Departure may change dynamics within Netanyahu's coalition, despite not automatically toppling the government or triggering elections before 2026.
