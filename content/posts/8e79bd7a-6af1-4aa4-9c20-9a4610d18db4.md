宜家考虑提高美国产量以应对全球贸易中断

**宜家**考虑在美国和美洲各地提高产量，以应对全球贸易中断，并计划扩大其在北美、南美和中美的业务。这家瑞典零售商正在应对美国和中国之间紧张局势升级导致的不断上涨的运费和复杂情况，以及胡塞武装分子在红海袭击船只的情况。

Inter Ikea的全球供应经理**苏珊娜·怀兹纳斯**（Susanne Waidzunas）强调，目前在美洲销售的商品中约有十分之一是当地生产的，该地区有51家家居用品供应商。该公司正在探索扩大生产足迹的机会，以减少对特定国家或贸易路线的依赖。

这一举措是在许多国际集团考虑将生产转移到距离美国更近的地方时做出的，因为近期发生的事件（如新冠疫情、俄罗斯与乌克兰的战争以及胡塞武装分子袭击船只）导致全球航运能力中断，而美国是一个领先的消费市场。怀兹纳斯强调，企业需要适应更加动荡的世界，减少不健康的依赖。

宜家已经因航运网络中断而经历了某些产品的延误和供应不足。该公司目前在其供应链方面面临“高压”，因为许多同行正在为黑五等即将到来的销售活动提前订购。

 **Ikea** considers boosting production across the US and Americas amid global trade disruptions, with plans to increase its footprint in North America, South, and Central America. The Swedish retailer is responding to rising shipping costs and complexities due to escalating tensions between the US and China, as well as attacks on ships by Houthi militants in the Red Sea.

**Susanne Waidzunas**, global supply manager at Inter Ikea, highlighted that around a tenth of goods sold in the Americas are currently produced locally with 51 home furnishings suppliers across the region. The company is exploring opportunities to expand its production footprint and reduce dependencies on particular countries or trade lanes.

The move comes as many international groups consider bringing production closer to the US, a leading consumer market, due to disruptions in global shipping capacity caused by recent events such as Covid-19 pandemic, Russia's war with Ukraine, and Houthi attacks on ships. Waidzunas emphasized that businesses need to adapt to a more volatile world and reduce unhealthy dependencies.

Ikea has already experienced delays and availability constraints for certain products due to the disruptions in shipping networks. The company is now facing "high pressure" across its supply chain, with many peers ordering early for upcoming sales events like Black Friday.
