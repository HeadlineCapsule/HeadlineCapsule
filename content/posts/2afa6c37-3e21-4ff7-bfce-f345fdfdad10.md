乔尔贾·梅洛尼拒绝在欧盟高层职位谈判中妥协

意大利总理乔吉娅·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）被排除在欧盟领导人有关欧盟领导层顶级职位任命的最初讨论之外。这一冷落导致人们担心这可能会复杂化迅速达成协议的努力，以确定该集团未来的领导人和优先事项。在六国国家元首之间进行的私人晚餐会谈中，梅洛尼明显缺席，这促使她对这些谈判表示强烈批评。

梅洛尼被排除在这些讨论之外，官员们担心这可能会进一步 complicating 确保乌苏拉·冯德莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）担任欧洲委员会主席的第二个任期和其他决定的议会多数票。这一决定是由合格多数作出的，这意味着领导人理论上可以在没有梅洛尼或匈牙利总理维克多·奥班（Viktor Orbán）参与的情况下继续进行。然而，官员们担心孤立梅洛尼可能会促使她与法国极右翼领袖玛丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）结盟，并可能在未来破坏其他决定。

到目前为止，梅洛尼一直保持着与勒庞的距离，但身份和民主的一些成员仍在努力创建一个欧元怀疑派超级集团。处理梅洛尼的排除问题需要在下一次顶级工作峰会之前进行纠正。尽管梅洛尼在欧洲议会选举中表现强劲，但她可能不是她最初认为的“这样的权力人物”，因为三大集团（EPP、S&D 和 Renew）拥有足够的席位来确保冯德莱恩的确认，而无需 ECR 的选票。

**建议：**

1. 欧盟领导人应考虑将乔吉娅·梅洛尼纳入有关欧盟领导层顶级职位任命的未来讨论，以避免进一步的复杂性和她支持者的潜在反弹。
2. 三大集团（EPP、S&D 和 Renew）可能希望探索扩大他们的联盟，包括其他政党，例如绿党，以谈判更稳定的大多数。
3. 欧盟领导人应谨慎对待潜在的欧元怀疑派联盟，如果梅洛尼与玛丽娜·勒庞和维克多·奥班结盟，这可能会影响欧洲联盟未来的决定。

 **Summary:**  

Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, was excluded from initial discussions among EU leaders regarding top job appointments within the European Union's leadership. This snub has led to concerns that it could complicate efforts for a swift deal on the bloc’s future leadership and priorities. During private dinner talks between six national leaders of the three largest political parties, Meloni was notably absent, which caused her to express strong criticism towards those negotiations.

Meloni's exclusion from these discussions has raised concerns among officials that it could lead to further complications in securing a parliamentary majority for Ursula von der Leyen’s second term as European Commission president and other decisions down the line. The decision is made by qualified majority, meaning leaders could theoretically proceed without Meloni or Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's involvement. However, officials fear that isolating Meloni might embolden her to team up with French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and potentially scupper other decisions in the future.

Meloni has so far kept Le Pen at arm’s length, but some members of Identity and Democracy are still pursuing efforts to create a Eurosceptic supergroup. The handling of Meloni's exclusion is seen as needing correction ahead of the next top jobs summit. Despite her strong showing in European parliament elections, Meloni may not be "such a power player" as she initially thought, with the big three groups (EPP, S&D, and Renew) holding enough seats to secure von der Leyen's confirmation without ECR votes.

**Recommendations:**  

1. EU leaders should consider including Giorgia Meloni in future discussions on top job appointments within the European Union leadership to avoid further complications and potential backlash from her supporters.
2. The big three groups (EPP, S&D, and Renew) may want to explore broadening their coalition by including other parties such as the Greens in negotiations for a more stable majority.
3. EU leaders should be cautious of potential Eurosceptic alliances that could form if Meloni were to team up with Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orbán, which may impact future decisions within the European Union.
