纽约证券交易所交易故障，Interactive Brokers损失4800万美元

**新闻摘要：**

本月早些时候，纽约证券交易所（NYSE）发生交易故障，导致Interactive Brokers遭受重大损失。事件发生时，由于NYSE的技术问题，伯克希尔哈撒韦公司A类股票意外暴跌。这促使Interactive Brokers的客户在停牌期间下单买入，预计复牌后每股约185美元。然而，当交易恢复时，伯克希尔的股票在几分钟内飙升到741,941美元，导致Interactive Brokers在不同价格填补订单时遭受损失。

Interactive Brokers正在考虑针对NYSE的法律追索权，并声称480万美元的损失不会对收益产生重大影响。交易所拒绝了Interactive Brokers提出的赔偿要求，从而导致经纪公司周三发表声明。在这起事件中，约有40只证券受到影响，包括巴里克黄金和Chipotle餐厅连锁店。

NYSE将故障归因于价格带的技术问题，该价格带由负责整合所有美国证券交易所交易数据的“磁带”小组发布。Interactive Brokers的股价在周三未受此消息影响，今年迄今已上涨约48%。

 **Article Summary:**  

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) experienced a trading glitch earlier this month, which resulted in significant losses for Interactive Brokers. The incident occurred when Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares unexpectedly plummeted due to a technical issue on the NYSE. This led customers of Interactive Brokers to place buy orders during the halt, anticipating they would be filled at approximately $185/share once trading resumed. However, when trading did resume, Berkshire's shares surged as high as $741,941 within minutes, causing Interactive Brokers to incur losses from the orders being filled at various prices during this run-up.

Interactive Brokers is considering its options for recourse against NYSE and has stated that the loss of $48 million does not materially impact earnings. The exchange denied compensation claims made by Interactive Brokers, leading to a notice from the brokerage on Wednesday. In total, about 40 securities were affected during this incident, including Barrick Gold and Chipotle restaurant chain.

The NYSE attributed the glitch to a technical issue with price bands published by the group that consolidates trading data from all US securities exchanges, known as "tape." Interactive Brokers' shares were unaffected by this news on Wednesday and have seen an approximate 48% increase in value so far this year.
