加拿大成为本轮降息周期内第一个降息的G7国家央行

# 加拿大央行下调利率

**加拿大央行成为本轮降息周期中第一个采取行动的G7国家。** 周三，加拿大央行将基准利率从自去年7月以来的5%下调至4.75%。 行长蒂夫·麦克勒姆（Tiff Macklem）表示，如果通货膨胀继续减弱，进一步降息是合理的。

**加拿大的通货膨胀和经济状况：**
加拿大经济最近出现放缓，第一季度GDP增长为1.7%，低于2.2%的共识预期。 4月份的失业率为6.1%，为两年多以来的最高水平。 4月同比头条通胀率为2.7%，麦克勒姆行长表示有信心通胀将继续向2%的目标收敛。

**进一步降息的可能性：**
蒂夫·麦克勒姆行长提到，如果通货膨胀继续减弱，可以期待进一步的利率下调，但他同时也强调了过快行动的风险，例如全球紧张局势导致的更高通胀或加拿大房价增长速度超过预期。 加拿大帝国商业银行预计，从7月开始，加拿大央行今年将再降息三次。

**与其他G7国家的比较：**
加拿大央行的决定遵循了墨西哥、巴西和智利等拉丁美洲国家央行在今年早些时候的降息决定。 然而，它是第一个采取此类行动的G7成员。 交易员预计，除了日本之外，其他G7成员也可能在未来几个月放松货币政策。 预计欧洲中央银行和英格兰银行将很快进行首次降息，而美国联邦储备委员会9月降息的可能性为55%。

**对加拿大的影响：**
麦克勒姆行长强调，美国发生的事情对加拿大经济有重大影响，并提到他们可以与美方相距多远，但尚未接近这些极限。

 **Canada's Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates**  
The Bank of Canada has become the first G7 nation to lower its main interest rate in this cycle. The central bank reduced its policy rate to 4.75 per cent on Wednesday, down from 5 per cent since July last year. Governor Tiff Macklem stated that it is reasonable to expect further cuts if inflation continues to ease.

**Inflation and Economic Conditions in Canada:**  
Canada's economy has softened recently, with first-quarter GDP growth at 1.7 per cent below consensus expectations of 2.2 per cent. The unemployment rate was the highest in over two years at 6.1 per cent in April. Headline inflation stood at 2.7 per cent year on year in April, and Governor Macklem expressed increased confidence that it will continue to move closer to the 2 per cent target.

**Potential for Further Rate Cuts:**  
Governor Tiff Macklem mentioned that further rate cuts could be expected if inflation continues to ease but also highlighted risks associated with moving too quickly, such as higher inflation due to global tensions or faster-than-expected house price growth in Canada. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expects three more BoC rate cuts this year, starting in July.

**Comparison with Other G7 Nations:**  
The decision by the Bank of Canada follows rate cuts from central banks in Latin American countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Chile earlier this year. However, it is the first member of the G7 to take such action. Traders anticipate other G7 members, except Japan, may also loosen monetary policy in the coming months. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to make their first cuts soon, while there's a 55 per cent probability of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in September.

**Impact on Canada:**  
Governor Macklem emphasized that what happens in the United States has a significant impact on Canada's economy and mentioned that there are limits to how far they can diverge from the U.S., but they are not close to those limits yet.
