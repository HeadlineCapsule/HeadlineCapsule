可可价格下跌，因为对非洲作物供应的担忧缓解。

# 可可价格下跌，因西非雨季改善缓解了对产量过低的担忧

可可价格经历了显著的下跌，因为西非主要种植区雨季的改善缓解了人们对非洲作物产量过低的担忧。这导致对市场多头头寸的减少，从而使可可期货自 2022 年以来首次出现最长的连败。纽约和伦敦的最活跃合约分别下跌 5.6% 和 10.3%。

近期价格上涨是由加纳和科特迪瓦的恶劣天气和疾病影响作物所驱动的，这两个国家共同占全球可可豆产量的三分之二。高价格导致对该市场的投机资金大量流入。然而，随着这些国家的天气预报好转以及预期将恢复生产，再加上厄瓜多尔等其他国家的新的种植园，预计需求将得到更有效的满足。

尽管前景乐观，但一些分析师警告说，作物情况可能还没有完全恢复。市场期待着从科特迪瓦的豆荚计数调查和每周统计中获得更多关于作物状况的信息。

 **Article Summary:** Cocoa prices have experienced a significant drop as fears regarding African crop yields ease due to improved seasonal rains in west Africa's main growing region. This has led to hedge funds reducing their bullish bets on the market, resulting in the longest run of losses since 
2022 for cocoa futures. The most active contracts in New York and London saw a decline of 5.6% and 10.3%, respectively.

The recent price surge was driven by poor weather conditions and disease affecting crops in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which together account for two-thirds of the world's cocoa bean production. The high prices led to hedge funds investing heavily in the market. However, with better weather forecasts and expectations of recovery in these countries, coupled with new plantations in other nations like Ecuador, the demand is expected to be met more effectively.

Despite this positive outlook, some analysts caution that the crop situation may not have fully recovered yet. The market awaits pod counting surveys and weekly tally results from Ivory Coast for further insights into the state of the crops.
