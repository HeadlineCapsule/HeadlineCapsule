乌克兰农业集团老板警告基辅不要与欧盟发生出口争端

**乌克兰农业领袖警告基辅不要升级与欧盟的出口争端**

Kernel 的创始人，即乌克兰最大的农业公司之一，已敦促乌克兰政府不要延长与欧盟（EU）的食品出口争端。持续的冲突可能会危及欧盟在乌克兰对抗俄罗斯战争中的支持。

Kernel 的创始人 Andriy Verevskyi 是一位总部位于瑞士的商人，他强调，在这个关键时刻与欧盟成员国发生纠纷是不明智的。他建议在更重要的问题上进行合作，而不是仅仅关注农业供应问题。

去年，波兰带领其他几个欧盟国家对乌克兰谷物进口实施禁令，理由是他们的农民担心存在不公平竞争，从而引发了贸易争端。这一举动发生在欧盟于 2022 年取消对乌克兰出口限制以支持其受战争蹂躏的经济之后。

乌克兰还为糖和其他作物引入了许可证制度，以避免触发欧盟“紧急刹车”进口措施。如果数量超过 2021 年 7 月至去年 12 月期间年度平均进口量，将启动该措施。

Verevskyi 目前正与少数股东就其决定从华沙证券交易所退市进行法律斗争，他声称这是由于流动性不足。他坚持认为，这一举动符合 Kernel 注册地卢森堡的法律。

除了解决出口争端和法律问题外，Verevskyi 还强调了加强乌克兰法治和减少腐败的重要性，以吸引外国投资者参与战后重建工作。他还承认，在俄罗斯入侵之前，Volodymyr Zelenskyy 总统任期有限，但相信在他的任期内可以做更多事情。

**要点：**
- 乌克兰农业领袖警告基辅不要升级与欧盟的出口争端
- 争端可能会失去欧盟对俄罗斯战争的支持
- Kernel 的创始人建议在更重要的问题上进行合作
- 贸易争端始于去年 4 月，原因是进口关税和市场保护
- 乌克兰引入许可证以避免触发欧盟“紧急刹车”进口措施

 **Ukrainian agricultural leader warns Kyiv against escalating export feud with EU**

The founder of Kernel, one of Ukraine's largest agricultural companies, has cautioned the Ukrainian government about prolonging its dispute over food exports with the European Union (EU). The ongoing conflict could potentially jeopardize the bloc's support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.

Andriy Verevskyi, a Switzerland-based businessman and founder of Kernel, emphasized that it would be unwise to engage in disagreements with EU member states during such a critical time. He suggested cooperation on more important matters rather than focusing solely on agricultural supply issues.

The trade dispute began last year when Poland led several other EU countries to impose bans on Ukrainian cereal imports, citing unfair competition concerns from their farmers. This move came after the EU lifted restrictions on Ukraine's exports in 2022 to support its war-ravaged economy.

Ukraine has also introduced licenses for sugar and other crops to avoid triggering an EU "emergency brake" on imports, which would be activated if quantities exceeded the annual average imported between July 2021 and December last year.

Verevskyi is currently involved in a legal battle with minority shareholders over his decision to delist Kernel from the Warsaw Stock Exchange due to what he claims was insufficient liquidity. He maintains that this move complied with Luxembourg's laws, where Kernel is registered.

In addition to addressing the export dispute and legal issues, Verevskyi stressed the importance of strengthening Ukraine's rule of law and reducing corruption to attract foreign investors for postwar reconstruction efforts. He also acknowledged that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had limited time in office before Russia's invasion but believes more could have been done during his tenure.

**Key Points:**
- Ukrainian agricultural leader warns Kyiv against escalating export feud with EU
- Dispute risks losing the bloc's support for Russian war effort
- Founder of Kernel advises cooperation on more important matters
- Trade dispute started in April last year over import duties and market protection
- Ukraine introduced licenses to avoid triggering an EU "emergency brake" on imports
