# 中国芯片制造商警告低阶芯片价格战将愈演愈烈

**中国领先的芯片制造商** **中芯国际**警告称，在中国国内市场，针对**技术较成熟的半导体芯片**的**价格战**正在升级。随着多家新工厂即将投产，全球产能过剩的可能性增加，而**美国出口管制**的因素也加剧了这一情况，导致中国芯片制造商加紧生产以支持华为等公司。由于国内竞争对手带来的价格压力加大，中芯国际的利润率大幅下降，降至2009年以来的最低水平。该公司预计价格下跌将尤为显著，特别是在**显示驱动芯片**和**图像处理传感器**领域。业内分析师也对产能过剩表示担忧，在即将于今年投产的42家新工厂中，有18家位于中国，主要生产技术较成熟的芯片。

尽管有全球需求复苏的迹象，特别是中国**智能手机市场**的需求复苏，但中芯国际仍对产能新增速度超过需求增长持谨慎态度。该公司正与客户密切合作，并预计2024年上半年收入将增长20%，这是由于订单高于预期。但他们也在密切关注订单激增对今年下半年产生的影响。中芯国际的主要重点是供应关键的半导体芯片，而不是即时的盈利能力，这凸显了其在美国出口管制日益严格的背景下，在该领域的战略重要性。英特尔和高通最近被吊销向华为供货的出口许可证，这突显了中芯国际对中国科技行业所做贡献的关键性质。

# China’s SMIC Warns of Fiercer Price War for Less Advanced Chips 

**SMIC**, **China's** leading **chipmaker**, has issued a warning about the intensifying **price war** within the domestic market for **less advanced semiconductors**. This development comes as new plants are set to commence production soon, leading to a potential **global oversupply**. The situation is further exacerbated by **US export controls**, prompting Chinese chipmakers to ramp up production to support companies like **Huawei**. SMIC has experienced a significant drop in profit margins, reaching their lowest point since 2009, due to increased price pressure from domestic competitors. The company foresees further price dips, particularly in **display driver chips** and **image processing sensors**. Industry analysts share concerns about oversupply, with 18 out of 42 new plants starting operation this year located in **China**, primarily producing less advanced chips.

Despite signs of a global demand recovery, especially in **China's smartphone market**, SMIC remains cautious about the potential for new production capacity to outpace demand. The company is working closely with customers and has forecasted a 20% revenue growth in the first half of 2024 due to higher-than-expected orders. However, they are closely monitoring the impact of this rush of orders on the second half of the year. SMIC's primary focus is on supplying key semiconductors rather than immediate profitability, underscoring the strategic importance of their role in the face of tightening US export controls. The recent revocation of export licenses for Intel and Qualcomm to ship to Huawei underscores the critical nature of SMIC's contributions to China's tech sector.
