**Summary of the Article:**
Taiwan leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses China of helping Russia pressure countries not to attend a planned peace summit. He urges Asian leaders, including US defense secretary Lloyd Austin, to join the event in Switzerland on June 15-16. The Ukrainian president criticizes China for supplying dual-use items that are being used by Moscow and claims Chinese support will prolong the war.

**Key Questions:**

1. What is Volodymyr Zelenskyy's main concern regarding China's involvement in the Ukraine conflict?
2. How has the US responded to Zelenskyy's call for increased participation and support at the peace summit?
3. Why does Zelenskyy believe that Chinese attendance is crucial for achncing a successful outcome of the peace summit?
4. What are some potential implications if China continues its current level of involvement in supporting Russia during the conflict with Ukraine?
5. How might other Asian countries respond to Zelenskyy's call for support at the upcoming peace summit, and what factors could influence their decisions?

**Answers:**
1. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is concerned that China's refusal to attend the planned peace summit in Switzerland and its supply of dual-use items to Russia are helping prolong the war against Ukraine. He believes Chinese support for Russia will disrupt the event, making it less likely to achieve a successful outcome.
2. The US has partially lifted its ban on using some American-supplied weapons to strike military targets inside Russian territory across the border from Kharkiv region. US defense secretary Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy and reiterated unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, but Zelenskyy still believes that more needs to be done.
3. Zelenskyy believes Chinese attendance is crucial because it would demonstrate a commitment from both parties involved in the conflict (Russia and Ukraine) to achieve peace. He also thinks China's influence on Russia could help persuade Moscow to participate, increasing the chances of success at the summit.
4. If China continues its current level of involvement by supplying dual-use items to Russia, it may lead to a prolonged conflict and further destabilization in the region. This could also strain diplomatic relations between China and other countries that support Ukraine or are concerned about regional security.
5. Other Asian countries' response to Zelenskyy's call for support at the upcoming peace summit will likely depend on their geopolebalance, economic interests, and political relationships with both Russia and China. Countries may also consider the potential impact of their decisions on global stability and regional security when making their choices.
