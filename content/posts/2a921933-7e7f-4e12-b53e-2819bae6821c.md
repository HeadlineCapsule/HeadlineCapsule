欧洲极右翼为何内部瓦解

## 欧洲极右翼派别出现裂痕 ##

在**即将到来的欧洲选举**前夕，欧洲的**极右翼**势力正经历内部分裂。[**玛丽娜·勒庞**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen) 的**[民族阵线](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally_(France))**（RN）与其德国盟友**[德国另类选择党](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany)（AfD）决裂。导致这一决定的原因是 RN 内部担心 AfD 变得过于极端，尤其是在其领先候选人之一 **Maximilian Krah** 为**纳粹德国的党卫队（SS）的行动**辩护后。这次分裂可能会影响极右翼党派在欧洲议会中的更广泛组成。意大利总理 **[Giorgia Meloni]** 表达了团结欧洲层面各种右翼派别的意愿，但她排除了与 AfD 有任何关联的可能性。

## 科索沃-塞尔维亚紧张局势升级 ##

**科索沃**最近对一家塞尔维亚银行的镇压行动，以及其在塞族控制地区推行欧元作为主要货币的努力，招致了欧盟和美国的谴责。普里什蒂纳这一单方面的举动被认为不利于塞尔维亚族裔社区，当地警方强制关闭了六家塞尔维亚邮政储蓄银行的分行。 欧盟和美国批评这一举动破坏了通过对话解决科索沃与塞尔维亚之间紧张局势的努力。同时，科索沃警方为其行动辩护称，这些银行分行是在非法运营。

## 摘要 ##

这篇文章涵盖两个主要主题：欧洲极右翼联盟在选举前夕分裂，以及普里什蒂纳单方面的举动导致科索沃和塞尔维亚之间的紧张局势升级。它强调了这些事态发展如何影响欧盟内部政治动态和更广泛的国际关系。

**问题 1:** Le Pen 的 RN 和 AfD 之间分道扬镳的具体因素是什么？ 

**答案 1：**主要因素是 RN 内部越来越认为 AfD 在言论和政策上变得过于极端。这一看法源于 AfD 一份关于驱逐有移民背景的人，包括德国护照持有者的计划被泄露，以及 Maximilian Krah 为纳粹统治期间党卫队行动辩护的言论。这些事态发展与勒庞“净化”其政党形象的努力背道而驰，并在欧洲引起广泛批评。

**问题 2:** RN 和 AfD 分崩离析如何影响欧盟议会中右翼党派组成的？ 

**答案 2：**分裂为意大利总理 Giorgia Meloni 领导的其它右翼派系巩固其在欧盟议会中的权力创造了机会。Meloni 表达了团结各种右翼团体的愿望，但由于 AfD 的极端立场而拒绝与他们有任何关联。这可能会导致欧洲层面右翼政治势力的重新调整

Here is a summary of the article, focusing on the bolded themes and key points:

**European Far-Right Factions Fracture**: 

The **far-right** in Europe is experiencing internal divisions ahead of the **upcoming European elections**, with **Marine Le Pen's** **Rassemblement National** **(RN)** severing ties with its German ally, the **Alternative for Germany (AfD)**. The decision stems from concerns within the RN that the AfD is becoming too extreme, particularly after comments made by one of their lead candidates, Maximilian Krah, justifying the actions of the **SS in Nazi Germany.** This split may impact the broader composition of right-wing and far-right parties in the EU Parliament. Italian Prime Minister **Giorgia Meloni** has expressed interest in uniting various right-wing factions at the EU level, but has ruled out any association with the AfD. 

## Kosovo-Serbia Tensions Flare Up: 

**Kosovo's** recent crackdown on a Serbian bank and its efforts to impose the euro as the primary currency in Serb-controlled areas have drawn condemnation from both the **EU** and the US. This unilateral action by Pristina is seen as detrimental to the ethnic Serb community, with police forcing the closure of six branches of the Serbian Postal Savings Bank. The EU and US criticized the move as undermining efforts to resolve tensions between Kosovo and Serbia through dialogue. Meanwhile, Kosovo police defended their actions, stating that the bank branches were operating illegally. 

## Summary: 

The article covers two main themes: the fracturing of far-right alliances in Europe ahead of elections and escalating tensions between Kosovo and Serbia due to Pristina's unilateral actions. It highlights how these developments impact broader political dynamics within the EU and international relations more broadly. 

Now, for the interesting questions and answers: 

1. Q: What specific factors led to the fracture between Le Pen's RN and the AfD? 
A: The primary factor was the growing perception within the RN that the AfD was becoming too extreme in its rhetoric and policies. This perception was fueled by a leaked plan from the AfD to deport people with immigrant backgrounds, including German passport holders, as well as comments made by Maximilian Krah justifying the actions of the SS during Nazi rule. These developments conflicted with Le Pen's efforts to "detoxify" the image of her party and attracted widespread criticism across Europe. 

2. Q: How might the breakup between RN and AfD impact the composition of right-wing parties in the EU Parliament? 
A: The fracture creates an opportunity for other right-wing factions, particularly those led by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, to consolidate power within the EU Parliament. Meloni has expressed interest in uniting various right-wing groups but has ruled out any association with the AfD due to their extreme positions. This could lead to a realignment of right-wing politics in
