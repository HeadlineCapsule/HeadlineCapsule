美国正在与以色列讨论向乌克兰派遣爱国者导弹系统

# 文章摘要：美国正在与以色列讨论向乌克兰发送以色列的爱国者系统

美国、以色列和乌克兰目前正在讨论将多达八套**爱国者**防空系统从以色列转移到乌克兰的可能性。这一举措将显著增强乌克兰抵御俄罗斯空袭的能力。该安排涉及先将爱国者系统从以色列运送到美国，然后再运送到乌克兰，标志着以色列与莫斯科的关系发生了转变。

以色列此前宣布计划退役其超过 30 年的八套**爱国者电池**，并用更先进的系统取代它们。然而，由于担心可能与伊朗支持的真主党民兵发生冲突，这些电池尚未停用。

乌克兰之前曾请求西方盟友提供像美国制造的**爱国者**这样的防空系统。美国最近暂停向其他国家交付爱国者拦截导弹，表明优先考虑向乌克兰供应。

以色列对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的谨慎态度受到莫斯科在叙利亚的影响力的影响，以色列军队经常在叙利亚采取行动对抗伊朗代理人。然而，美国官员强调，俄罗斯与伊朗日益紧密的联系是以色列更紧迫的担忧。

正在讨论转移所有八套系统，但可能不会导致全部系统被送往乌克兰。乌克兰外长德米特罗·库列巴和他的同行安东尼·布林肯就这一问题举行了会谈，以色列和基辅也直接进行了讨论。美国和以色列政府拒绝置评，而乌克兰政府敦促拥有爱国者系统的国家向乌克兰提供这些系统。

以色列的旧型 M9^01 PAC-2 电池仍与新型电池兼容，并且有足够的拦截导弹库存可供乌克兰使用。军事分析人士认为，由于旧型以色列拦截导弹的射程更长、弹头更大，因此非常适合拦截俄罗斯战斗机向乌克兰城市投掷滑翔炸弹。

转移爱国者系统的计划可能涉及将它们出售回美国，然后美国可以将其发送给乌克兰。然而，以色列必须考虑是否愿意疏远其时断时续的盟友俄罗斯，尽管莫斯科与伊朗的关系不断加深。

 # Article Summary: US in talks to send Israel's Patriot systems to Ukraine

The United States, Israel, and Ukraine are currently engaged in discussions regarding the potential transfer of up to eight **Patriot** air defence systems from Israel to Ukraine. This move would significantly enhance Ukraine's defensive capabilities against Russian air strikes. The arrangement involves sending the Patriots first from Israel to the US before delivery to Ukraine, marking a shift in Israel's relations with Moscow.

Israel had announced plans to retire its eight **Patriot batteries** dating back over 30 years and replace them with more advanced systems. However, due to concerns about potential conflict with Iran-backed Hizbollah militants, the batteries have not yet been discontinued.

Ukraine has previously requested western allies for air defence systems like the US-made **Patriots**. The recent pause in delivering Patriot interceptor missiles to other nations by the US indicates a prioritization of supply to Ukraine.

Israel's cautious stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine is influenced by Moscow's clout in Syria, where Israeli forces often act against Iranian proxies. However, US officials have emphasized that Russia's increasingly close ties with Iran are a more pressing concern for Israel.

The transfer of all eight systems is being discussed but may not result in the entirety being sent to Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and his counterpart Antony Blinken have held talks on this matter, as well as discussions between Israel and Kyiv directly. The US and Israeli governments declined to comment while the Ukrainian government urged countries with Patriot systems to provide them to Ukraine.

Israel's older M9^01 PAC-2 batteries are still compatible with newer models, and they have ample stocks of interceptor missiles for use in Ukraine. Military analysts suggest that the old Israeli interceptor missiles could be well suited for intercepting Russian fighter jets dropping glide bombs on Ukrainian cities due to their longer range and bigger warhead compared to newer PAC-3 models.

The transfer of Patriot systems would likely involve selling them back to the US, which could then send them on to Ukraine. However, Israel must consider whether it is willing to alienate its on-off ally Russia despite Moscow's growing relationship with Iran.
