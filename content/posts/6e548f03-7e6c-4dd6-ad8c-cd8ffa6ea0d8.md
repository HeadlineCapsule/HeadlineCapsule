马里奥·德拉吉说，面对中国进口威胁，欧洲不能“被动”。

**马里奥·德拉吉** 强调，面对中国的进口威胁，欧洲不能袖手旁观，他主张采取更干预主义的方法，利用关税和补贴来抵消中国等国家的不公平优势。这位意大利前总理建议欧盟应该准备好在繁荣受到威胁时采取行动，并以美国最近对中国进口商品的决定为例，说明这对欧洲经济可能产生的影响。

德拉吉被委以重任，准备一份报告，阐述欧盟如何应对全球竞争力下降的问题，因为人们担心由于冠状病毒大流行和俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，欧盟已经落后于美国和中国。他指出，与美国同行相比，欧洲制造商雇佣的人数多出一倍以上，他们面临着来自更便宜的中国进口商品的不公平竞争。

这位前欧洲央行行长建议采取“对外经济政策”，旨在减少欧洲在国防、太空、关键矿产和制药等战略领域对不可信国家的依赖。他提议，在军事采购中对欧盟生产的产品和零部件实施更明确的本地含量要求，作为解决这些担忧的一种潜在解决方案。

总之，马里奥·德拉吉呼吁欧盟采取积极主动的态度，利用关税和补贴来对抗来自中国等国的不公平竞争，并探索通过对外经济政策减少战略进口依赖的方式。

 **Mario Draghi** emphasizes that Europe must not remain passive against China's import threat, advocating for a more interventionist approach using tariffs and subsidies to counteract unfair advantages held by countries like China. The former Italian premier suggests the EU should be prepared to take action if its prosperity is threatened, highlighting recent US decisions on Chinese imports as an example of potential implications for Europe's economy.

Draghi has been tasked with preparing a report on how the EU can address its declining global competitiveness amid concerns that it has lost ground to both the US and China due to the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He argues that European manufacturers, which employ more than double the number of people as their US counterparts, are vulnerable to unfair competition from cheaper Chinese imports.

The former ECB president recommends a "foreign economic policy" aimed at reducing Europe's dependency on countries it can no longer trust in strategic areas like defense, space, critical minerals, and pharmaceuticals. He suggests applying more explicit local content requirements for EU-produced products and components in military procurement as a potential solution to address these concerns.

In summary, Mario Draghi calls on the European Union to adopt a proactive stance against unfair competition from countries like China by utilizing tariffs and subsidies while also exploring ways to reduce dependency on strategic imports through foreign economic policies.
