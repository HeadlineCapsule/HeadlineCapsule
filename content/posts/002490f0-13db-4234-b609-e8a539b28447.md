政府建议英国人囤积物资，作为紧急情况下的应急计划的一部分。

英国**政府**发起了一项名为“做好准备”的新运动，鼓励**英国**家庭储备必需品。这一举措旨在确保国家更好地应对紧急情况，包括洪水、停电和另一场大流行病。该网站提供了一份推荐用品清单，如瓶装水、非易腐烂食品、手电筒和急救箱等。

虽然政府强调这只是合理的规划，而不是恐慌性购买或囤积货物，但零售商仍持谨慎态度。他们向公众保证没有大量采购的必要，大多数家庭已经拥有足够的非易腐烂食物。这一举措旨在提高**英国**的总体韧性，使其与芬兰和日本等国公民的准备水平相一致。

为了进一步增强国家的韧性，**副首相奥利弗·道登**还将宣布为部长和议员提供危机管理培训，并开展一次大规模的大流行病模拟演习，涉及社会的各个部门。



## 一些有趣的问题：

1. Q: 为什么英国政府现在鼓励储备物资？ 
 A: 英国政府的这一举措是“准备”运动的一部分，旨在通过让公民储存瓶装水、非易腐烂食品和应急设备等推荐用品，增强国家应对未来危机的能力并确保更快的复苏。 

2. Q: 这项举措与恐慌性购买或囤积有何不同？ 
 A: “囤积”一词可能会让人想起大流行病初期超市空荡荡货架的情景，但政府强调这一倡议是合理规划。其目的是让家庭在不造成短缺的情况下，拥有充足的供应。零售商支持这一区别，并提醒公众大多数家庭已经有足够的非易腐烂食物，所以没有大量购买的必要。 

3. Q: 还有哪些措施来提高国家的韧性？ 
 A: 除了“准备”运动之外，副首相奥利弗·道登还宣布为部长和议员提供危机管理培训。此外，明年还将举行一次大规模的大流行病模拟演习，政府和公共服务部门的成千上万的人将会参与其中。这些措施旨在提高英国应对和恢复潜在紧急情况的能力。

Here is a summary of the article: 

**British** households are being encouraged by the **government** to stock up on essential items as part of a new campaign, **"Prepare"**. This initiative aims to ensure the country is better equipped to handle emergencies, including **floods**, power cuts and even another pandemic. The website provides a checklist of recommended supplies, such as bottled water, non-perishable food, torches, and first aid kits. 

While the government emphasizes that this is about sensible planning and not panic buying or stockpiling, retailers are cautious. They assure the public that there is no need to bulk buy and that most households already have adequate non-perishables. This initiative aims to increase **Britain's** overall resilience and align it with countries like Finland and Japan, which are known for their citizen preparedness. 

To further strengthen national resilience, **Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden** will also announce crisis management training for ministers and MPs and a large-scale pandemic simulation exercise involving various sectors of society. 


## Interesting Questions:

1. Q: Why is the British government encouraging stockpiling now? 
A: The British government's initiative to encourage households to stockpile essential items is part of their new campaign, "Prepare." This campaign aims to enhance the country's readiness and resilience in the face of potential emergencies, including floods, power outages, and another pandemic. By having citizens stock up on recommended supplies like bottled water, non-perishable food, and emergency equipment, the government hopes to minimize the impact of future crises and ensure a quicker recovery. 

2. Q: How is this initiative different from panic buying or stockpiling? 
A: While the term "stockpiling" might evoke memories of empty supermarket shelves during the early days of the pandemic, the government emphasizes that this initiative is about sensible planning. It aims to empower households to have a reasonable amount of supplies on hand without creating shortages for others. Retailers support this distinction and remind the public that most households already have adequate non-perishables, so there's no need to bulk buy. 

3. Q: What other measures are being taken to improve national resilience? 
A: In addition to the "Prepare" campaign, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden announced plans for crisis management training for ministers and MPs. This will ensure that those in leadership positions are better equipped to handle future crises effectively. Furthermore, a large-scale pandemic simulation exercise is also in the works for next year, involving tens of thousands of participants across government and public services. These measures aim to strengthen Britain's ability to respond to and recover from potential emergencies.
