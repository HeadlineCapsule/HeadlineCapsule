南非执政党寻求组建“全国统一政府”

# 南非执政党提议组建“全国统一政府”

南非执政党非洲人国民大会（ANC）在过去一周的选举中失去了议会多数席位，这是自30年前种族隔离制度结束以来的首次。此后，该党宣布计划邀请其他政党组建“全国统一政府”。

**总统西里尔·拉马福萨**领导下的ANC在最近的议会选举中赢得了40.2%的选票。他们已与包括民主党（DA）、经济自由战士党和因卡塔自由党在内的多个政党进行了初步会谈。

然而，由于各政党之间的意识形态分歧，组建全国统一政府可能面临挑战。民主党为加入任何包含经济自由战士党或雅各布·祖马领导的乌姆康托韦西兹韦党（MK）的政府设定了明确的“红线”。金融分析师彼得·阿塔德·蒙塔尔特警告说，如果不成立联合政府，可能会对金融市场产生负面影响。

ANC还考虑了其他选择，例如与民主党和自由党签订“供应和信任”协议，但遭到其联盟合作伙伴的反对。由前总统祖马领导的MK最初拒绝参与谈判，除非拉马福萨辞职；然而，他们后来与ANC进行了关于组建联合政府的讨论。

总之，在最近一次选举中失去议会多数席位后，南非执政党正在寻求组建全国统一政府。尽管初步讨论正在进行中，但意识形态分歧和一些政党的反对仍然存在挑战。

 **Summary of Article: South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) Proposes 'Government of National Unity'**

South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), has announced its intention to invite other political parties to form a "government of national unity" following last week's election. The ANC lost its parliamentary majority in this election for the first time since the end of apartheid 30 years ago.

**President Cyril Ramaphosa**, leader of the ANC and South Africa, stated that they would draw on past experiences with national unity governments to move the country forward. The ANC won **40.2%** of votes in the recent parliamentary elections. Preliminary talks have already been held with several parties including the Democratic Alliance (DA), Economic Freedom Fighters, and Inkatha Freedom Party.

However, forming a government of national unity may face challenges due to ideological differences among political parties. The DA has set clear "red lines" against joining any government that includes the EFF or Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Financial analyst Peter Attard Montalto warned of potential negative impacts on financial markets if a unity government is not formed.

The ANC had also considered other options such as a "supply and confidence" agreement with the DA and IFP, but faced opposition from within its alliance partners. MK, led by former president Zuma, initially refused to participate in talks unless Ramaphosa resigned; however, they have since held engagements with the ANC regarding a coalition.

In conclusion, South Africa's ruling party is seeking to form a government of national unity following their loss of parliamentary majority in recent elections. While preliminary discussions are underway, challenges remain due to ideological differences and opposition from some political parties.
