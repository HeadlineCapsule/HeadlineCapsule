# Reddit 股价飙升，与 OpenAI 达成内容协议

**Reddit的股价** 在宣布与 **OpenAI** 达成内容协议后，在盘后交易中飙升高达 15%，该协议允许这家人工智能公司为其 **聊天机器人** 使用该社交媒体平台的内容。该协议是 OpenAI 努力确保高质量和可靠数据的一部分，旨在增强其 AI 模型，同时也为 Reddit 提供了嵌入更多 **AI 工具** 的机会。该协议对双方都有利：OpenAI 获得了大量数据源，而 Reddit 则推进了其超越传统广告模式的 **货币化** 战略。

OpenAI 一直积极与各种媒体品牌和出版商合作，为其生成式人工智能技术收购数据。这包括与著名的公司如 **_金融时报_****、** **_美联社_** **和** **_世界报_** **等达成的协议。然而，该公司也面临着一些出版商的版权诉讼，如** **_纽约时报_** **，这些出版商不愿允许 OpenAI 和微软在没有补偿的情况下使用其内容。

Reddit 股价的上涨也意味着 **Sam Altman** 获得了可观的收益，他是 OpenAI 的联合创始人和首席执行官，持有这家社交媒体集团大量股份。在 Reddit 公开上市之前，Altman 的实体拥有该公司近 10% 的股份。该协议突显了社交媒体平台在人工智能蓬勃发展之际通过 **货币化** 其数据所带来的越来越明显的趋势，尽管这让一些重视 Reddit 独立性的用户感到不满。

Reddit 和 OpenAI 之间的协议展示了社交媒体与人工智能之间日益紧密的联系，数据已成为开发强大人工智能模型竞赛中的一项宝贵商品。随着人工智能继续演变并塑造各个行业，获取和道德使用数据将仍然是决定这些技术的成功和影响的关键因素。

# Reddit shares surge as it strikes content deal with OpenAI 

**Reddit's stock surged** by up to 15% in after-hours trading following the announcement of a content deal with **OpenAI**, allowing the AI company to utilize content from the social media platform for its **chatbot**. This agreement is part of OpenAI's efforts to secure high-quality and reliable data to enhance its AI models, while also providing Reddit with opportunities to embed more **AI tools**. The deal benefits both parties, with OpenAI gaining access to a vast source of data and Reddit advancing its **monetization** strategies beyond its traditional advertising-based model. 

OpenAI has been actively partnering with various media brands and publishers to acquire data for its generative AI technology. This includes deals with renowned companies such as the **Financial Times**, **Associated Press**, and **Le Monde**. However, the company is also facing copyright lawsuits from some publishers, such as **The New York Times**, who are reluctant to allow OpenAI and Microsoft to use their content without compensation. 

The surge in Reddit's stock price also translates into significant gains for **Sam Altman**, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, who holds a considerable stake in the social media group. Altman's entities owned close to 10% of Reddit's stock ahead of its public listing. The deal highlights the growing trend of social media platforms monetizing their data as the **AI boom** takes off, although it has upset some of Reddit's users who value the platform's historical independence.
