美国司法部决定暂不寻求欺诈指控，以推动企业合作

# 美国司法部（DoJ）拒绝起诉默克的子公司MilliporeSigma，尽管两名个人被指控欺诈该公司。

**文章摘要：**  
在美国**副司法部长**[**莉萨·莫纳科**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%8E%B1%E8%90%BD%C2%B7%E8%8E%AB%E7%A7%91)的倡议下，美国司法部（DoJ）决定不起诉默克的子公司**MilliporeSigma**，而两名个人因欺诈该公司被起诉。这一决定是莉萨·莫纳科鼓励企业[***自愿披露**](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%87%AA%E6%9C%AC%E5%85%AC%E5%91%8A)和与司法部合作以换取宽大处理的举措之一。重点已经转向解决国家安全风险，包括企业不当行为、**人工智能（AI）** 、**[加密货币](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81)**和数据安全威胁，如TikTok带来的风险。

**有趣的问题：**  
**Q1: 司法部拒绝起诉MilliporeSigma的决定如何与其鼓励企业自愿披露的目标相一致？**  
**A1:** 司法部不起诉MilliporeSigma的决定符合其鼓励公司主动披露内部不当行为的举措。通过对这家报告并配合调查两名个人欺诈活动的公司采取宽大处理，司法部旨在为其他公司树立榜样，即在涉及内部违规行为的案件中，自愿披露可以带来更有利的结果。

**Q2: 关于司法部鼓励企业自愿披露的方法，可能有哪些批评或担忧？**  
**A2:** 批评者认为，为公司自报不当行为提供激励措施可能会鼓励犯罪活动，因为组织可能认为只需报告自己的违法行为就能避免起诉。此外，人们还担心企业会重新犯罪，以及对于有多次犯罪记录的公司是否还会给予宽大处理。

**Q3: 副司法部长莉萨·莫纳科在白领犯罪和国家安全方面的背景如何影响她应对人工智能、加密货币和数据安全等现代威胁的方法？**  
**A3:** 莉萨·莫纳科拥有丰富的起诉公司犯罪和高科技犯罪的经验，曾担任过国土安全和反恐顾问。她的背景使她能够认识到企业当前面临的威胁不断演变的性质，包括人工智能、加密货币以及TikTok等

**Summary of Article:**  
The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has declined to prosecute MilliporeSigma, a subsidiary of Merck, despite charges against two individuals for defrauding the company. This decision is part of Deputy Attorney-General Lisa Monaco's initiative to encourage corporate self-disclosure and cooperation with the DoJ in exchange for leniency on prosecution. The focus has shifted towards addressing national security risks, including corporate malfeasance, artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies, and data security threats like those posed by TikTok.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: How does the DoJ's decision to decline prosecution of MilliporeSigma align with its goal of encouraging corporate self-disclosure?  
A1: The DoJ's decision not to prosecute MilliporeSigma is in line with its initiative to encourage companies to voluntarily disclose misconduct within their ranks. By showing leniency towards the company, which had reported and cooperated on the fraudulent activities of two individuals, the DoJ aims to set an example for other corporations that self-disclosure can lead to more favorable outcomes in cases involving internal wrongdoing.

Q2: What are some potential criticisms or concerns regarding the DoJ's approach to encouraging corporate self-disclosure?  
A2: Critics argue that providing incentives for companies to self-report misconduct may encourage criminal activity, as organizations might believe they can avoid prosecution by simply reporting their wrongdoings. Additionally, there is concern about the potential for recidivism among corporations and whether leniency will be granted if a company has a history of repeated offenses.

Q3: How does Deputy Attorney-General Lisa Monaco's background in white-collar crime and national security inform her approach to addressing modern threats such as AI, cryptocurrencies, and data security?  
A3: With experience prosecuting cases like Enron executives and advising on homeland security and counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco brings a wealth of knowledge in white-collar crime and national security to her current role. This background allows her to recognize the evolving nature of threats facing corporations today, including those posed by AI, cryptocurrcuencies, and data security risks like TikTok's potential for foreign influence or propaganda. Monaco's approach emphasizes adapting enforcement strategies to address these modern challenges while maintaining a focus on national security interests.
