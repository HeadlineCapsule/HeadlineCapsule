# **WisdomTree** 面临与最大股东的新一轮斗争

**ETFS Capital** 的董事长 **Graham Tuckwell** 发起了一场罢免 **WisdomTree** **CEO** **Jonathan Steinberg** 的运动，并敦促投资者在即将举行的年度会议上投票反对他的重新任命。这是自 2022 年初以来持续争议的最新进展，Tuckwell 批评该公司最近进入**去中心化金融**的举措，并呼吁出售这家资产管理公司。

Tuckwell 的公司拥有约 **18%** 的 WisdomTree 股份，他认为公司的价值在 **21 亿美元**到 **30 亿美元**之间，远高于其目前的市值 **14 亿美元**。他批评了 WisdomTree 在去中心化金融方面的举措，包括推出 **WisdomTree Prime 数字钱包**服务及其**现货比特币 ETF**的表现不尽如人意。作为回应，WisdomTree 强调了其最近在净流入超过 **290 亿美元**方面的成功，并强调了其 **ETF 业务**重点，该业务目前在美国排名 **第九**。

WisdomTree 与最大股东之间的斗争将在 **6 月 12 日**的年度会议上达到高潮，Tuckwell 寻求除 Steinberg 之外，还罢免现任董事长 **Win Neuger** 和董事会成员 **Anthony Bossone**。这并非 Tuckwell 首次成功影响 WisdomTree 领导层的变动，他曾在 2023 年罢免了老牌董事长 **Frank Salerno**。
