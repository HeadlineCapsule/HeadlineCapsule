# 老山姆要你…买**绿色债券**？

**绿色债券** 是**政府** 和**企业** 发行的一种**债务工具**，用于为**绿色项目** 和**可持续倡议** 提供资金。随着全球约价值 2.6 万亿美元的绿色债券的发行，这一概念已得到认可。然而，作为世界最大的债券发行机构，**美国财政部** 尚未进入该市场。本通讯将探讨美国发行绿色债券的可能性以及对市场的潜在影响。

美国有发行**特殊目的债务**的历史，特别是第二次世界大战期间的**战争债券**和 9/11 袭击后的“爱国债券”。现在，在全球金融机构的推动下，有人提议美国财政部发行首批绿色债券。此举可吸引新的投资者，例如专注于绿色投资的外国养老基金，并利用“绿色溢价”，从而降低利息成本。

然而，也有一些**复杂因素**需要考虑。**气候变化**在美国的政治化可能会使确定合适的绿色项目变得困难。尽管如此，一些分析师认为，无论政治立场如何，联邦政府一定程度上的绿色融资都是可行的。法国、德国、加拿大和墨西哥等国类似债券的成功发行也凸显了绿色债券的可行性。

尽管美国财政部拒绝置评，但重要的是要注意到，即使他们接受这一想法，也需要数年时间才能将绿色债券推向市场。与此同时，关于如何为**气候适应性**和**缓解** 筹集资金的最佳方式的辩论仍在继续。名人或卡通人物代言的潜在影响也是一个有趣的考虑因素，就像 Bugs Bunny 鼓励美国人购买战争债券一样。

通讯还提到了会计师面临的挑战，因为企业对**可再生能源**的需求激增。**国际会计准则理事会 (IASB)** 提议对**可再生能源购买协议** 给予特殊豁免，允许企业将此类合同作为正常采购而非金融衍生品入账。该提案旨在减少当前会计准则造成的复杂性和扭曲，这些准则规定当过量电量被出售时，此类合同作为衍生品处理。

然而，该提案遭到了一些 IASB 成员的反对，他们认为该提案是不适当的，因为可再生能源购买者对其需求的变化性质是了解的。该提案现在开放征求评论，时间缩短至 90 天，反映出这一问题紧迫性。

最后，通讯简要提及了政府在从燃烧引擎向电动汽车转型中面临的潜在收入损失，这将影响燃料税收，以及这已经如何影响着电动汽车的定价。

# Uncle Sam wants you . . . to buy green bonds?

**Green Bonds** are a type of debt instrument issued by governments and corporations to fund **green projects** and **sustainable initiatives**. With about $2.6 trillion worth of green bonds issued globally, the concept has gained traction. However, the **US Treasury**, the world's biggest bond issuer, has not yet entered the market. This newsletter explores the possibility of the US issuing green bonds and the potential impact on the market. 

/n/n

The US has a history of issuing **special-purpose debt**, notably **war bonds** during World War II and "patriot bonds" after the 9/11 attacks. Now, with a push from global financial institutions, there is a proposal for the US Treasury to issue its first green bonds. This move could attract new investors, such as foreign pension funds with a focus on green investments, and take advantage of the "greenium," potentially reducing interest costs. 

/n/n

However, there are **complications** to consider. The politicization of **climate change** in the US could make identifying suitable green projects challenging. Nonetheless, some analysts argue that a base level of federal green financing is feasible regardless of the political administration. The success of similar issuances by other countries, such as France, Germany, Canada, and Mexico, underscores the viability of green bonds. 

/n/n

While the US Treasury has declined to comment, it is important to note that even if they embrace the idea, it will take years to bring green bonds to market. In the meantime, the debate continues on how best to raise funds for **climate resiliency** and **mitigation**. The potential impact of celebrity or cartoon character endorsements, similar to Bugs Bunny's encouragement of Americans to buy war bonds, is also an interesting consideration. 

/n/n

The newsletter also touches on the challenges faced by accountants due to the surge in **corporate demand for renewable energy**. The **International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)** has proposed a special exemption for **renewable energy purchase agreements**, allowing companies to account for such contracts as normal purchases rather than financial derivatives. This proposal aims to reduce the complexity and distortion caused by the current accounting rules, which treat these contracts as derivatives when excess electricity is sold. 

/n/n

However, the proposal has faced dissent from some IASB members, who argue that it is inappropriate given that renewable energy purchasers are aware of the variable nature of their demand. The proposal is now open for comments, with a shorter-than-usual 90-day period, reflecting the urgency of the issue. 

/n/n

Lastly, the newsletter briefly mentions the potential revenue loss for governments due to the shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles, which will impact fuel duty collections, and how this is already affecting the pricing of electric vehicles.
