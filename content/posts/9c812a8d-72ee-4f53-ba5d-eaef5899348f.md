# '**钱多得很**'：米尔肯会议参与者期待并购交易复兴

**米尔肯研究所会议**是金融和投资专业人士的一个著名聚会，会上讨论了大量交易并预测并购和其他金融交易将出现复苏。由**高盛首席执行官大卫·所罗门**主持的活动吸引了众多知名人士参与，包括**伊隆·马斯克**，数千名与会者包括基金经理、银行家和投资者。与会者形容现场氛围如同“拉斯维加斯”，资本充裕，充满机遇。 

中东投资者的存在感明显，反映出权力格局的转变，而关于中国的讨论则更为谨慎，许多投资者在中国经济增长问题上采取观望态度。**太平洋投资管理公司的首席执行官戴维·亨特**表示，中东投资者不仅寻求投资机会，还希望获得能为他们地区带来金融服务业就业机会的交易。 

与会者一致认为，**2025年将是交易繁荣的一年**，有些人甚至预测交易活动可能会加速并提前到2024年。然而，地缘政治不确定性和估值分歧可能会产生负面影响。**私募股权管理公司**面临出售资产和向投资者返还资金的压力，买方有现金时可以挑选交易并要求获得更好的条款。 

会议还强调了私募股权行业的转变，重点关注**以更严格的条件重新融资贷款**和**私人信用债权人**的出现。**加州教师退休系统副首席投资官斯科特·陈**指出，私募股权支持的公司在销售稀缺方面面临挑战。总的来说，米尔肯会议展示了全球投资和交易动态的演变，重点转向美国经济和中东，并对中国采取了更为谨慎的态度。
