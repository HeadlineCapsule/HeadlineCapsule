以色列在加沙营救了四名人质，但许多巴勒斯坦人被报道死亡

# 以色列军队在白天成功解救了加沙的四名人质。

Noa Argamani、Almog Meir Jan、Andrey Kozlov 和 Shlomi Ziv 的获救使自与哈马斯战争开始以来活着被送回的人质总数达到七名。这些人在以色列南部诺瓦音乐节期间被绑架，根据以色列官员的说法，哈马斯的这次袭击造成了 1200 人死亡。

这次行动发生在努赛拉特，涉及对相距约 200 米的两处地点的同时突袭。人质家属论坛总部称这次救援为“奇迹般的胜利”，该总部代表了被绑架者的亲属。然而，这次行动也造成了众多巴勒斯坦人的伤亡，哈马斯媒体办公室报道有 210 人死亡，400 人受伤。以色列军方发言人承认有“不到 100 人”的伤亡，并指责哈马斯利用平民作为掩护。

总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡誓言要继续行动，直到所有人质，无论活着还是死去，都被送回家乡。这次救援行动发生在美国对以色列施加国际压力的同时，要求以色列同意停火，因为加沙的平民死亡人数很高。

 **Summary:**  
Israel's military successfully rescued four hostages in Gaza during a daylight operation. The rescue of Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv brings the total number of hostages returned alive to seven since the war against Hamas began. These individuals were kidnapped from the Nova music festival in southern Israel during a previous attack by Hamas that resulted in 1,200 fatalities according to Israeli officials.

The operation took place in Nuseirat and involved simultaneous raids on two locations about 200 meters apart. The rescue was hailed as a "miraculous triumph" by the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, which represents relatives of captives. However, the operation also resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties, with Hamas's media office reporting 210 killed and 
400 injured. Israel's military spokesman acknowledged "under 100" casualties but accused Hamas of using civilians as cover.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue operations until all hostages, both living and deceased, are returned home. The rescue comes amidst international pressure on Israel to agree to a ceasefire due to the high civilian death toll in Gaza.
