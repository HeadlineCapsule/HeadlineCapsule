# 获得 1 亿英镑信贷注入后，苏格兰港口改造工程启动

位于因弗内斯附近的苏格兰港口小镇 **阿尔德赛** 正在进行重大转型，其港口被重新开发为 **北海风电** 的 **配送中心**。该项目由 **海文图斯** 管理，已从 **苏格兰国家投资银行** 和 **英国基础设施银行** 获得 1 亿英镑的信贷注入，这是两家银行首次联合融资。在此之前， **量子资本集团** 去年已提供了 3 亿英镑的初始投资。

改造项目旨在将这个前 **石油工业** 遗址转变为一个集 **运输和维护涡轮机** 及其他海上风电场设备为一体的中心。随着英国致力于在 2030 年之前实现 50 **吉瓦** 的海上风电目标，该项目有望发挥关键作用。目前，约有 300 名建筑工人正在现场施工，建设一个新的 650 米码头墙和相关设施，预计将于 2024 年年底完工。

该港口计划容纳 **海上风电开发商**，并已吸引了多家公司的兴趣，例如 **BW Ideol** 打算建立一个制造厂，生产浮动风电平台所需的混凝基地。该项目还包括一个 **轻工业区**，以容纳为该行业提供服务的企业。随着世界逐渐远离石油和天然气，海上风电带来了重大机遇，而阿尔德赛的项目很适合利用这一转型带来的机会。

然而，该新兴行业也面临着诸多挑战，包括 **物流和供应链问题**、专业船舶短缺以及电力电网连接有限。尽管存在这些障碍，但参与该项目的人仍对其潜力充满信心。对港口改造的资助也标志着这两家国有开发银行之间的一次重要合作，重点是支持围绕 **净零排放** 和经济增长的倡议。该项目得到了苏格兰首席部长的支持，她强调了实现 "更公平、更绿色未来" 的机会。

# Scottish port redevelopment gets under way after £100mn credit injection

**Ardersier**, a port town near Inverness, Scotland, is undergoing a significant transformation with the redevelopment of its port as a **distribution hub** for **North Sea wind power**. The project, managed by **Haventus**, has received a £100 million credit injection from the **Scottish National Investment Bank** and the **UK Infrastructure Bank**, marking their first joint funding arrangement. This follows an initial investment of £300 million from **Quantum Capital Group** last year.

The redevelopment aims to turn the former **oil industry** site into a hub for **transporting and maintaining turbines** and other equipment for offshore wind farms. With the UK targeting 50 **gigawatts** of offshore wind power by 2030, the project is expected to play a crucial role. Currently, about 300 construction workers are on site, building a new 650-meter quay wall and associated facilities, with completion scheduled for the end of 2024. 

/n/n

The port plans to host **offshore wind developers** and has already attracted interest from companies like **BW Ideol**, which intends to set up a manufacturing facility for concrete bases needed for floating wind platforms. The project also includes a **light industrial district** to accommodate firms servicing the industry. With the world moving away from oil and gas, offshore wind presents significant opportunities, and the Ardersier project is well-positioned to capitalize on this transition. 

/n/n

However, the developing sector also faces challenges, including **logistical and supply chain issues**, a lack of specialized vessels, and limited electricity grid connections. Despite these hurdles, those involved in the project remain confident in its potential. The financing for the redevelopment also marks a significant collaboration between the two state-owned development banks, with a focus on supporting initiatives around **net-zero emissions** and economic growth. The project has received support from Scotland's first minister, who highlighted the opportunity for a "fairer, greener future."
