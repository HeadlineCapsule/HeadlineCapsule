凯雷竞购企业公关公司，将从WPP手中接管控制权

**私募股权集团KKR竞购FGS Global控制权**

近几个月，私募股权集团KKR已向WPP提出收购金融传播公司FGS Global的控制性股份。然而，WPP拒绝了这一报价，因为价格太低。这家英国上市的广告集团目前拥有FGS约55%的股份，而KKR在去年达成协议后已经持有约30%的股份，当时该公司的估值为14.3亿美元。

WPP拒绝了增加股份的最新报价，因为价格太低，但KKR有可能以更高的价格再次出价。这种情况被描述为“价格谈判”，尽管WPP董事会不认为FGS是“待售”的，但他们会谨慎履行其受托责任。

WPP、KKR和管理层一直在制定计划，准备在未来两年内将FGS上市。这种情况突显了WPP所面临的综合体折扣问题，即其在伦敦证券交易所80亿英镑的市值低于其众多运营业务的总和。

FGS Global是一家战略咨询和传播咨询公司，在全球近30个办事处为超过1600名客户提供服务。该公司由三家由WPP控制的传播和游说公司合并而成：总部位于伦敦的Finsbury、总部位于法兰克福的Hering Schuppener以及美国Glover Park Group。

通信和公关领域最近发生了一系列私募股权支持的交易，包括Tulchan Communications被出售给全球咨询公司Teneo（CVC拥有部分股份）以及Powerscourt被出售给由私募股权集团TPG支持的传播和投资者关系公司Morrow Sodali。

WPP还拥有其他几家全球传播公司，包括BCW和Hill & Knowlton在今年早些时候合并成立Burson，由谷歌前通信主管Corey duBrowa领导。

 **Private Equity Group KKR's Bid for Majority Control of FGS Global**

In recent months, private equity group KKer has approached WPP over taking majority control of financial communications firm FGS Global. However, the offer was rejected by WPP as being too low. The UK-listed advertising group currently owns about a 55% stake in FGS, while KKR already holds approximately a 
30% stake after striking a deal last year that valued the business at $1.43 billion.

The latest offer for an increased stake was dismissed as being too low by WPP, but there is potential for KKR to return with a higher bid. The situation has been described as a "price negotiation," and while the WPP board does not consider FGS to be "for sale," they are mindful of their fiduciary responsibility.

WPP, KKR, and management have been working on a plan to float FGS in the next two years. The situation highlights how WPP suffers from a conglomerate discount, whereby its £8 billion London stock market valuation is worth less than the sum of its many operating businesses.

FGS Global is a strategic advisory and communications consultancy with close to 30 offices around the world serving more than 1,600 clients. The group was formed through the merger of three communications and lobbying companies controlled by UK-listed WPP: London-based Finsbury, Frankfurt-based Hering Schuppener, and US Glover Park Group.

The recent flurry of private equity-backed dealmaking in the communications and PR sector includes Tulchan Communications being sold to Teneo, a global advisory firm part-owned by CVC, and Powerscourt being sold to Morrow Sodali, a communications and investor relations firm backed by private equity group TPG.

WPP owns several other global communications firms, including BCW and Hill & Knowlton merged earlier this year to create Burson, led by Corey duBrowa, former communications chief at Google.
