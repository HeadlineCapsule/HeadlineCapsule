# 一级方程式赛车追求 VIP 极乐世界

**一级方程式**进军美国市场的成果丰硕，迈阿密大奖赛就是一个绝佳的例子，证明了这项运动越来越受欢迎，并能带来可观的收益。现在已经是第三年的迈阿密大奖赛已经成为了一个"目的性"活动，吸引了名人和豪客们，他们愿意付出高额的费用来获得独家进入机会和体验。迈阿密在 **VIP** 管理方面的专业知识保证了为付费客户提供无缝体验，这是成功的基础。其结果是一个 **复杂的独家层级结构**，进入最热门的区域和活动的价格从数万到数十万美元不等。这一策略促进了 **一级方程式** 出色的财务表现，第一季度收入同比增长 45%。

体育和私人资本的交集在足球领域也非常明显，以 **埃弗顿足球俱乐部** 正在进行的收购传奇和伊普斯维奇镇与伯明翰城的对比命运为重点。美资机构投资人拥有的伊普斯维奇镇尽管预算相对有限，却连续获得晋升，进入了 **英格兰超级联赛**。同样由美国拥有的伯明翰城则不幸降级到第三级联赛，凸显了这项运动所固有的挑战和风险。英格兰第二级联赛 **冠军联赛** 被形容为 "赌场"，吸引了高风险的支出，这是由于晋升英超联赛的前景所带来的诱惑。

本通讯还包含对阿斯顿维拉高管克里斯·赫克的采访，他旨在打破英超联赛的等级制度，以及切尔西俱乐部共同所有者托德·波利关于收购 Hayfin Capital Management 的深度会谈，以及私募股权集团 Silver Lake 回归大型收购的情况。

# F1 reaches for VIP nirvana 

**Formula One's** foray into the US market is paying dividends, with the Miami Grand Prix serving as a prime example of the sport's growing appeal and revenue-generating capabilities. The race, now in its third year, has become a "destination" event, attracting celebrities and high-rollers willing to pay a premium for exclusive access and experiences. This success is underpinned by Miami's expertise in managing **VIPs**, ensuring a seamless experience for those willing to pay for it. The result is a **labyrinthine hierarchy of exclusivity**, with prices ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for access to the most coveted locations and events. This strategy has contributed to **Formula 1's** impressive financial results, with first-quarter revenues increasing by 45% year-on-year. 

The intersection of sports and private capital is also evident in football, with a focus on **Everton FC's** ongoing takeover saga and the contrasting fortunes of Ipswich Town and Birmingham City. Ipswich, owned by a US institutional investor, has achieved back-to-back promotions to reach the **English Premier League**, despite a relatively modest budget. Birmingham City, also US-owned, suffered relegation to the third tier, highlighting the challenges and risks inherent in the sport. The **Championship**, England's second tier, is described as a "casino", attracting high-risk spending fueled by the allure of Premier League promotion. 

The newsletter also includes an interview with Aston Villa executive Chris Heck, who aims to disrupt the Premier League hierarchy, and notes on Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly's advanced talks to acquire Hayfin Capital Management, and private equity group Silver Lake's shift back to large-scale acquisitions.
