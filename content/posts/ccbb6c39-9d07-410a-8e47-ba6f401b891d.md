俄罗斯使用美国武器发动袭击将有助于基辅坚守阵地，一位官员说。

## 概要：
**乌克兰国家安全局局长** **Oleksandr Lytvynenko** 呼吁美国解除对使用美国供应武器的限制，允许乌克兰打击俄罗斯境内的目标。Lytvynenko 认为这将有助于乌克兰阻止莫斯科的新攻势，对于自卫非常必要。他认为，用远程导弹打击俄罗斯的军火库、物流枢纽和炼油厂可以阻碍俄罗斯在 **哈尔科夫** 地区的攻势并防止进一步入侵。美国一直不鼓励打击俄罗斯境内的目标，但这一决定最终留给了乌克兰。弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基总统重申任何打击都将是防御性的，但与华盛顿的讨论尚未产生积极成果。 Lytvynenko还透露了俄罗斯军事任命的细节，表明 **弗拉基米尔·普京** 正准备与西方进行一场旷日持久且范围广泛的战争。他强调了西方制裁在削弱俄罗斯生产先进武器能力方面的重要性，同时敦促盟友进一步加强制裁机制。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 如果美国取消对乌克兰使用美国供应的武器打击俄罗斯境内目标的禁令，可能会有什么后果？
   - 解除禁令可以为乌克兰提供额外的军事能力，使其能够瞄准俄罗斯的补给线，从而削弱俄罗斯维持攻势的能力。然而，这也可能会导致俄罗斯与北约国家之间的紧张局势进一步升级，因为俄罗斯可能认为这些打击是美国及其盟友直接发动的攻击。

2. 为什么哈尔科夫地区在持续冲突中具有重要意义？
   - **哈尔科夫** 地区与俄罗斯别尔哥罗德地区接壤，易受乌克兰袭击。俄罗斯通过攻势在该地区建立缓冲区，旨在保护这一区域并可能将乌克兰军队从顿涅茨克等其他战略要地引开。夺取哈尔科夫将是俄方的一大胜利，因为这座城市规模较大且靠近俄罗斯边境。

3. 普京对军事和国家安全机构进行改组可能会如何影响战争的走向？
   - **弗拉基米尔·普京** 的任命，包括任命一名经济学家担任国防部长，表明其关注重点转向了经济考量以及与西方长期冲突的规划。这可能意味着俄罗斯将进一步动员本国经济来支持战争努力，如果感受到威胁，可能对乌克兰或其他北约国家采取更具侵略性的行动。

这些问题凸显了乌克兰及其盟友面临的一些复杂的战略考虑，以及冲突潜在的未来走向。

## Summary: 

**Oleksandr Lytvynenko**, Ukraine's **national security chief**, has called on the US to lift restrictions on the use of American-supplied weapons, allowing Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia. Lytvynenko argues that this would help Ukraine thwart Moscow's new offensive and is necessary for self-defense. He believes that striking Russian arms depots, logistics hubs, and oil refineries with long-range missiles could stall Russia's advances in the **Kharkiv** region and prevent further incursions. While the US has maintained its position against encouraging strikes inside Russia, it has left the decision to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that any strikes would be defensive, but discussions with Washington have not yielded positive results so far. Lytvynenko also provided insights into Russian military appointments, indicating **Vladimir Putin's** preparation for a prolonged and expanded war with the West. He emphasized the importance of Western sanctions in degrading Russia's ability to produce sophisticated weaponry while urging allies to strengthen their sanctions regime further. 

## Interesting Questions: 

1. Q: What are the potential consequences if the US lifts the ban on Ukraine using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia? 
A: Lifting the ban could provide Ukraine with additional military capabilities and allow them to target Russian supply lines, potentially degrading Russia's ability to sustain its offensive operations. However, it may also lead to further escalation between Russia and NATO countries, as Russia could perceive these strikes as a direct attack by the US and its allies. 

2. Q: Why is Kharkiv region significant in the context of the ongoing conflict? 
A: The **Kharkiv** region shares a border with Russia's Belgorod region, which has been vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks. By creating a buffer zone through their offensive, Russia aims to protect this area and potentially draw Ukrainian forces away from other strategic locations like Donetsk. Capturing Kharkiv would be a significant victory for Russia due to its size and proximity to the Russian border. 

3. Q: How might Putin's reshuffling of his military and national security apparatus impact the trajectory of the war? 
A: The appointments made by **Vladimir Putin**, including an economist as defense minister, indicate a shift in focus towards economic considerations and long-term planning for a prolonged conflict with the West. This could mean increased mobilization of Russia's economy to support its war efforts and potentially more aggressive actions against Ukraine or other NATO countries if they are perceived as threats. 

These questions highlight some of the complex strategic considerations faced by both Ukraine and its allies, as well as potential future trajectories of the conflict.
