# “**常识**” 的武器化 

英国保守党议员 **艾斯特·麦克维（Esther McVey）** 被任命了一个奇怪的职位 "**常识部长**"，这一任命遭到了嘲笑和质疑。在她的首次正式演讲中，麦克维试图引用 **亚里士多德（Aristotle）** 关于常识是理性决策工具的想法来为她的职位辩护。然而，这次演讲（其中包括 19 次 "**常识**" 的说法）因专注于 **公务员的挂绳** 等琐事，而不是实质性的政策问题而成为笑柄。这一事件凸显了该职位的荒唐，以及 "常识" 如何被右翼作为 **文化战争** 策略的 "**武器**"。这个短语被用来断言他们的立场明显正确并阻止辩论，声称占据了理性的高地。这种策略不仅限于英国，在美国政治中也同样存在，比如 **唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）** 就利用 "常识" 来拉拢支持者。虽然有必要挑战文化战争中超越常识的言论，但简单地断言自己的立场是显而易见的并不能有效地赢得辩论。

# The weaponisation of ‘common sense’ 

**Esther McVey**, a UK Conservative MP, was appointed to the curious role of "**Minister for Common Sense**", an appointment that was met with ridicule and confusion. In her first official speech, McVey attempted to justify her position by invoking **Aristotle's** idea of common sense as a tool for rational decision-making. However, the speech, which included the phrase "**common sense**" 19 times, was mocked for its focus on trivial issues like **civil servants' lanyards** rather than substantial policy matters. The episode highlighted the absurdity of the role and the way in which "common sense" is being **weaponized** as a **culture war** tactic by the right. The phrase is used to assert the obvious correctness of their position and shut down debate, claiming a rational high ground. This tactic is not unique to the UK and can be seen in US politics as well, with figures like **Donald Trump** invoking "common sense" to rally supporters. While there is a need to challenge statements made in culture wars that go beyond common sense, simply asserting one's position as self-evident is not a productive way to win arguments.
