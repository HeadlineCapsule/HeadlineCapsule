# 克罗泽尔（Crozier）对邮政丑闻一无所知的说法因多封信件的曝光而受到质疑

**英国电信**（BT）董事长亚当·克罗泽尔（Adam Crozier）声称他在担任**皇家邮政**（Royal Mail）首席执行官期间对**邮政局霍ライズ恩 IT 丑闻**（Post Office Horizon IT scandal）一无所知，但这一说法因多封信件被曝光而受到质疑。这些信件由多位国会议员撰写，包括现任财政大臣**杰里米·亨特**（Jeremy Hunt）在内，信件内容显示他们早在 2009 年就对该系统提出了担忧。这与克罗泽尔今年2月在**邮政局调查**（Post Office inquiry）中所作的陈词相矛盾，他在调查中表达了对在任期间未意识到该问题的后悔。 这些新曝光的信件是通过《**信息自由**》（Freedom of Information）请求获得的，它们揭示了克罗泽尔与多位议员之间的通信，包括亨特、弗朗西斯·莫德勋爵（Lord Francis Maude）、德鲁·戴维（Drew David）和亨利·本杰明勋爵（Lord Henry Bellingham），他们对霍ライズ恩系统表达了担忧，并要求了解问题的范围和解决方案。这与克罗泽尔声称的**皇家邮政**和**邮政局**之间严格的分离说法相矛盾，表明他可能对该问题知之甚多。

克罗泽尔为自己辩解称，他每周都会收到数百封信件，并把信件交由邮政局管理团队处理，相信他们会遵照他的指示公平处理。然而，霍ライズ恩丑闻已导致超过 900 名**邮政局分支经理**（Post Office branch managers）被错误定罪，其影响巨大，引发了公众的广泛愤怒，并使人们质疑包括克罗泽尔在内的相关人员的角色和责任，他目前在**英国电信**和**惠特布雷德**（Whitbread）公司担任要职。

# Crozier’s claim he was unaware of Post Office scandal undermined by letters 

**BT** chair Adam Crozier's assertion that he was unaware of the **Post Office Horizon IT scandal** while he was chief executive of **Royal Mail** has been challenged by the discovery of **correspondence** from several **MPs**, including the current **chancellor Jeremy Hunt**, raising concerns about the system as early as 2009. This contradicts Crozier's statement to the **Post Office inquiry** in February, where he expressed regret for not being aware of the issues during his tenure. The newly found letters, obtained through a **Freedom of Information** request, reveal that Crozier was contacted by multiple MPs, including Hunt, Lord Francis Maude, Drew David, and Lord Henry Bellingham, who raised concerns about the Horizon system and requested information on the scope and resolution of the problems. This contradicts Crozier's claim of a strong separation between **Royal Mail** and the **Post Office**, suggesting that he may have had more knowledge of the issues than previously stated.

In his defense, Crozier stated that he received hundreds of letters weekly and delegated correspondence to the Post Office management team, trusting that his directions would be followed fairly. However, the impact of the Horizon scandal, which resulted in the wrongful convictions of over 900 **Post Office branch managers**, has sparked widespread outrage and calls into question the role and responsibility of those involved, including Crozier, who now holds prominent positions at **BT** and **Whitbread**.
