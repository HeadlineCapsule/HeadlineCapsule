保险业高管称伦敦在内部保险市场上正在落后

## 摘要：
在最近的一篇文章中，业内高管们表达了对伦敦在**内部保险**或** captive 保险**市场中的地位的担忧，与百慕大、新加坡等全球中心相比，他们担心伦敦会落后。英国正在经历公司建立自己的实体来覆盖企业风险而不是依赖外部供应商的增长。

文章强调了伦敦专业商业保险市场的必要性，该市场为伦敦经济贡献了约三分之一的产出，必须对这一趋势做出“更聪明”和更创新的回应。行业领袖们强调，伦敦不能在专业保险和再保险方面满足于现状。

政府计划制定新的法规，以鼓励英国 captive 保险公司，但由于选举被推迟而推迟了咨询。文章还指出，伦敦的传统做法可能阻碍了其与百慕大、根西岛等税收较低、监管较轻的中心竞争的能力。

研究表明，降低资本要求等规则变化可能会导致在英国建立近700家 captive 保险公司，为伦敦带来就业和业务。然而，行业专家指出，伦敦的传统做法可能阻碍了其在此市场中创新领先的地位。

总之，尽管伦敦仍然是全球商业保险市场中的强劲参与者，但迫切需要增加创新和适应性，以保持与其他中心竞争的力度，这些中心由于保险 liên结证券和 captive 保险等新产品而迅速发展。

 ## Summary:
In a recent article discussing London's position within the **in-house insurance** or **captive insurance** market, industry executives have expressed concerns about falling behind other global centers such as Bermuda and Singapore. The UK is experiencing growth in companies setting up their own entities to cover corporate risks instead of relying on external providers.

The article highlights the need for London's specialist commercial insurance market, which contributes about a third of the City’s economic output, to be "smarter" and more innovative in response to this trend. Industry leaders have emphasized that London cannot afford complacency regarding its leading market share in **specialist insurance** and **reinsurance**.

Government plans for new regulations aimed at encouraging captive insurers within the UK were mentioned, but a consultation has been delayed due to an election being called. The article also notes that London's traditional approach may be hindering its ability to compete with lower-tax and more lightly regulated centers like Bermuda and Guernsey.

Research suggests that rule changes such as lower capital requirements could lead to the establishment of nearly amo**ut 700 captive insurance companies in the UK, bringing jobs and business to London. However, industry experts have pointed out that London's traditional approach may be preventing it from being at the forefront of innovation within this market.

In conclusion, while London remains a strong player in the global commercial insurance market, there is an urgent need for increased innovation and adaptation to remain competitive with other centers experiencing rapid growth due to new products like **insurance-linked securities** and captive insurance.
