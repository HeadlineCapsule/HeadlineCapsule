# **科技巨头**监管打击蔓延至亚洲和澳大利亚 

**日本、韩国和澳大利亚**是最新的挑战**科技巨头**市场主导地位的国家，继**欧盟**和**美国**的类似行动之后。重点是**遏制苹果公司和谷歌的权力**，新的立法旨在增加竞争和消费者的选择。

在**日本**，一项旨在防止**占主导地位的移动软件平台**排挤竞争对手的法案获得通过，给消费者带来更多的选择，并允许从其他来源下载应用程序。这继**欧盟数字市场法**中，苹果公司被强制对其操作系统进行重大修改之后。

**韩国**正在引入范围广泛的立法，以监管电子商务到流媒体服务等在线平台。与此同时，**澳大利亚**正推动将其在线监管扩展到**数字支付**等领域，并强制要求科技巨头公司打击诈骗分子。

这种监管审查的蔓延令科技巨头们感到担忧，他们面临越来越多的挑战和不遵守法规的潜在罚款。虽然有人质疑这些措施在开放竞争方面的有效性，但其他人却认为这是遏制科技巨头主导地位及其对消费者选择和隐私影响的必要步骤。

随着日本和韩国等主要经济体的参与，科技行业正面临着全球性的转变，即如何审查和监管他们的运营，这可能迫使他们适应不同的区域法律，从而改变他们的商业模式和实践。

# Big Tech regulatory crackdown spreads to Asia and Australia 

**Japan, South Korea, and Australia** are the latest countries to challenge the market dominance of **Big Tech** companies, following similar moves by the **EU** and the **US**. The focus is on **reining in the power of Apple and Google**, with new legislation aimed at increasing competition and consumer choice. 

In **Japan**, a bill has been approved to prevent **dominant mobile software platforms** from excluding rivals, giving consumers more options and allowing app downloads from alternative sources. This follows the **EU's Digital Markets Act**, which forced Apple to make significant changes to its operating system. 

**South Korea** is introducing wide-ranging legislation to regulate online platforms, from ecommerce to streaming services. Meanwhile, **Australia** is pushing to expand its online regulation into areas like **digital payments**, with mandatory obligations for Big Tech companies to tackle scammers. 

The spread of this regulatory scrutiny is causing concern for tech giants, who face increasing challenges and potential fines for non-compliance. While some question the effectiveness of these measures in opening up competition, others see it as a necessary step to curb the dominance of Big Tech and its impact on consumer choice and privacy. 

With the involvement of major economic powers like Japan and South Korea, the tech industry is facing a global shift in how their operations are scrutinized and regulated, potentially forcing them to adapt their business models and practices to comply with varying regional legislations.
