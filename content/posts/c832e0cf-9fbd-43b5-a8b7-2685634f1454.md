# 消失的第三波莫迪浪潮：印度选举的本地关注与总理地位的动摇

根据预测，**纳伦德拉·莫迪**（印度总理）和他的**印度人民党**（**BJP**）将以压倒性优势赢得第三个任期。然而，随着作者和一组记者穿越印度，从**安得拉邦**到**马哈拉施特拉邦**，他们没有发现预期中对莫迪的支持浪潮。相反，他们发现当地选民关注的是本地问题和领导人，而总理及其政策则成为次要考虑。虽然**中产阶级**的城市选民表达了对莫迪成就的骄傲，特别是在国家的**经济增长**上；**农村选民**却谈论**食品价格上涨**和政府支持不足的问题。文章还指出，BJP 激进地从对手政党招募候选人，这些候选人通常**没有意识形态的承诺**。在关键的**马哈拉施特拉邦**（拥有大量议会席位）出现对 BJP 的日益失望情绪，选民们认为该党过于激进，威胁印度**民主**。尽管莫迪仍有可能赢得第三个任期，但其多数席位可能减少，这可能会缓解人们对其政党霸权的担忧。

# Missing: India's third Modi wave 

**Narendra Modi**, India's prime minister, and his **Bharatiya Janata** party (**BJP**) were predicted to win a third term in office by a landslide. However, as the author and a group of journalists traveled across India, from **Andhra Pradesh** to **Maharashtra**, they found no signs of the expected "wave" of support for Modi. Instead, they encountered a focus on local issues and leaders, with the prime minister and his policies being an afterthought for many voters. While **middle-class** urban voters expressed pride in Modi's achievements, particularly the country's **economic growth**, **rural voters** spoke of **rising food prices** and the need for more government support. The BJP's aggressive recruitment of candidates from rival parties, often with **no ideological commitment**, was also noted. In **Maharashtra**, a key state with a large number of parliamentary seats, there is growing disillusionment with the BJP, with voters perceiving them as overaggressive and threatening Indian **democracy**. While Modi is still likely to win a third term, it may be with a reduced majority, which could temper fears of his party's dominance.
