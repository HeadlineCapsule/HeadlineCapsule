华尔街最后剩下的空头在说服乐观的客户时举步维艰

# 摘要：

华尔街的一小部分策略师继续警告美国市场可能因经济增长放缓和人工智能（AI）的过度炒作而出现下跌。尽管对标普500指数今年年底的预测有所提高，但这些熊市分析师在说服乐观的客户时面临挑战。

要点包括：

1. 少数剩下的熊市策略师努力说服投资者，由于经济增长放缓和人工智能过度炒作，市场可能出现下跌。

2. 金融巨头高盛、花旗集团和瑞银等华尔街银行已提高了对标普500指数今年年底的预测，该指数今年已达到历史新高。

3. 熊市分析师认为股票估值过高，标普500的回溯市盈率自1960年以来处于最高位。

4. 一些原本谨慎的分析师已提高了他们的预测，预计未来六个月将进一步上涨近10%。

5. 在牛市期间，熊市者很难坚持自己的逆势观点，如果他们在下跌发生之前转为牛市立场，可能会被视为愚蠢。

6. 摩根大通分析师预测标普500指数从当前水平下跌近25%，原因包括劳动力市场降温和房屋销售下降等因素。

7. 生成人工智能对企业盈利能力的影响可能不足以防止股票市场的潜在修正。

 ## Summary:

A small group of Wall Street strategists continue to warn about a potential US market downturn due to slowing economic growth and excessive hype around artificial intelligence (AI). Despite upgraded end-of-year forecasts for the S&P 500 index, these bearish analysts face challenges in convincing optimistic clients.

Key points include:
1. The few remaining bearish strategists struggle to convince investors of a potential market downturn due to slowing economic growth and excessive AI hype.
2. Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and UBS, have upgraded their end-of-year forecasts for the S&P 지수, which has reached record highs this year.
3. Bearish analysts argue that stock valuations are too high, with the S&P 500's trailing price-to-earnings ratio in the top decile since 1960.
4. Some previously cautious analysts have upgraded their forecasts, suggesting a further gain of almost 10% over the next six months.
5. Bears face challenges maintaining their contrarian views during bull runs and may be perceived as foolish if they switch to bullish positions before a downturn occurs.
6. JPMorgan analysts predict an S&P 500 tumble of almost 25% from current levels by year-end, citing factors such as a cooling labor market and declining home sales.
7. The impact of generative AI on corporate profitability may not be significant enough to prevent a potential correction in equities.
