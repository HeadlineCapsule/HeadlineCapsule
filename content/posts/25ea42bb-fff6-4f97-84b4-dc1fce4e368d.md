# 德国法院认定德国选项党为“**疑似极端组织**” 

--- 

一家**德国法院**裁定，该国**国内情报机构**（**BfV**）将极右翼的**德国选项党**（**AfD**）归类为**疑似极右翼组织**是正当的。这项裁决使 BfV 能够对 AfD 进行**正式监控**，这一措施通常只针对对德国国家构成威胁的团体。 

**北莱茵-威斯特法伦州行政法院**维持了科隆一家下级法院先前的判决，称有充分证据表明德国选项党追求的目标有损**人类尊严和民主原则**。明斯特法院援引了德国选项党官员的言论，称其鼓吹**种族歧视**，并质疑移民在德国社会中的归属感，甚至那些已经融入社会并拥有德国公民身份的移民。 

德国**内政部长南希·费瑟**对这一裁决表示赞赏，称其展现了德国有能力抵御内部对民主的威胁。这一判决对德国选项党来说是一个重大打击，该党曾陷入一系列丑闻，支持率也不断下滑。 

该党表示计划向**莱比锡联邦行政法院**提起申诉，德国选项党的官员批评法院驳回了他们的上诉，未能充分考虑他们的证据。

# German Court Says AfD is ‘Suspected Extremist’ Organisation 

---

A **German court** has ruled that the country's **domestic intelligence agency**, the **BfV**, was justified in classifying the far-right **Alternative for Germany** (**AfD**) party as a **suspected extreme right-wing organization**. This ruling enables the BfV to place the AfD under **formal surveillance**, a measure typically reserved for groups posing a threat to the German state. 

The **Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia** upheld a previous judgment by a lower court in Cologne, stating that there is sufficient evidence of the AfD's pursuit of goals that undermine the **principles of human dignity and democracy**. The court in Münster cited statements by AfD officials that promoted **racial discrimination** and questioned the belonging of immigrants within German society, even those who are integrated and hold German citizenship. 

German **Interior Minister Nancy Faeser** commended the ruling, asserting that it demonstrates the country's ability to defend its democracy from internal threats. The verdict is a significant setback for the AfD, which has faced a series of scandals and seen its approval ratings slump. 

The party has indicated its intention to lodge a complaint with the **Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig**, with AfD officials criticizing the court's dismissal of their appeal and failure to adequately address their evidence.
