乔·拜登将花5000万美元在广告中描绘唐纳德·特朗普是“失控”的罪犯。

**乔·拜登的广告活动**: 美国总统乔·拜登即将推出一项价值5000万美元的广告活动，将对手唐纳德·特朗普描绘成一个意图报复的“失控”罪犯。这一举动是在第一次总统辩论前一周多一点的时间进行的，目标是摇摆州的选民。

**关注性格攻击**：拜登竞选活动加紧了对特朗普性格的攻击，强调他最近被定罪的34项与201年非法影响有关的重罪指控。

**针对性人口统计**：这项广告支出的很大一部分将专注于接触黑人、拉丁裔、亚裔美国人和夏威夷土著/太平洋岛民选民。该活动旨在强调拜登致力于为美国人而战，同时将特朗普描绘成自私自利的人。

**辩论舞台对比**：6月27日，两位候选人在亚特兰大举行的第一次电视辩论中面对面交锋——佐治亚州是一个关键的摇摆州，拜登在2020年以1.1万多票的微弱优势获胜。该广告活动寻求在辩论舞台上为总统拜登和被定罪的罪犯唐纳德·特朗普之间建立明确的选择。

**选举前景**：根据Fivethirtyeight.com的数据，特朗普目前在全国总统民意调查中领先拜登1.1个百分点。然而，摇摆州将在决定11月选举结果方面发挥决定性作用。双方竞选活动都在加紧努力接触摇摆州选民，因为他们为预计将是一场势均力敌的竞选做准备。

**筹款活动**：拜登最近在好莱坞的一次筹款活动中筹集了2800万美元，这是民主党历史上规模最大的活动。尽管特朗普在今年早些时候建立了7000万美元的现金优势，但他一直在积极地从华尔街到佛罗里达和得克萨斯州的共和党捐赠者那里筹集资金，因为他寻求连任。

 **Joe Biden's Ad Campaign**: US President Joe Biden is set to launch a $50 million ad campaign, portraying his opponent Donald Trump as an "unhinged" felon intent on retribution. This move comes just over a week before the first presidential debate and targets voters in battleground states.

**Focus on Character Attacks**: The Biden campaign is intensifying its attacks on Trump's character, highlighting his recent conviction of 34 felony counts related to illegal influence during the 201

**Targeted Demographics**: A significant portion of this ad spend will focus on reaching Black, Latino, Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander voters. The campaign aims to emphasize Biden's dedication to fighting for Americans while painting Trump as self-serving.

**Debate Stage Comparison**: On June 27th, the two candidates will face off in their first televised debate in Atlanta, Georgia - a crucial swing state that Biden won by just over 11,000 votes in 2020. The ad campaign seeks to establish a clear choice between President Biden and convicted felon Donald Trump on the debate stage.

**Election Outlook**: According to Fivethirtyeight.com, Trump currently leads Biden by 1.1 percentage points in national presidential polls. However, battleground states will play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the November election. Both campaigns are ramping up efforts to reach swing state voters as they prepare for what is expected to be a close contest.

**Fundraising Efforts**: Biden recently raised over $28 million at a Hollywood fundraiser, marking the largest Democratic party event in history. Despite having built an early cash advantage of $70 million this year, Trump has been actively raising funds from Republican donors across Wall Street to Florida and Texas as he seeks re-election.
