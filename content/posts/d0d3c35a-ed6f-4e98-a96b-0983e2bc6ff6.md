特朗普顾问史蒂夫·班农被判入狱

# 史蒂夫·班农因藐视国会而被判入狱

史蒂夫·班农，前《布雷巴新闻》主席，唐纳德·特朗普的密切顾问，已被美国联邦法官命令在7月1日之前投降服刑。此前他被判犯有藐视国会罪。这一判决是调查2021年1月6日特朗普支持者袭击美国国会大厦事件的一部分。班农因拒绝遵守国会调查该事件的传票而被判处四个月监禁，并罚款6500美元。

班农的定罪被视为当局持续努力追究那些试图推翻2020年总统大选结果的人员责任的一部分。这包括对特朗普盟友和前顾问彼得·纳瓦罗和肯尼斯·切斯布罗等人的指控。

班农还将于9月面临另一项审判，他被指控欺诈性地从旨在为美国-墨西哥边境墙筹集资金的众筹活动中募集资金。他已对这些指控表示不认罪。

 **Article Summary:**

Steve Bannon, former chair of Breitbart News and close adviser to Donald Trump, has been ordered by a US federal judge to surrender for prison by July 1 after being convicted of contempt of Congress. The sentencing comes as part of the investigation into the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of former President Trump. Bannon was sentenced to serve four months and ordered to pay a fine of $6,500 for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the Congressional committee probing the incident.

Bannon's conviction is seen as part of an ongoing effort by authorities to hold accountable those involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden. This includes charges against Trump allies and former advisers, such as Peter Navarro and Kenneth Chesebro.

Bannon is also set to face a separate trial in September for defrauding donors who contributed to a crowdfunding campaign aimed at raising money for a wall along the US-Mexico border. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges.
