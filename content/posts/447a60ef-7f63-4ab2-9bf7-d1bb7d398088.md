妮基·黑利表示她将投票给唐纳德·特朗普作为美国总统。

## Summary:
**美国前南卡罗来纳州州长兼驻联合国大使**尼基·黑利宣布支持 **唐纳德·特朗普**连任美国总统。尽管在今年早些时候共和党提名战中，她曾批评特朗普不适合担任总统，但她仍表示拜登的表现是“一场灾难”，并称自己将投票给特朗普。这位传统保守派的背书可能有助于扩大特朗普在党内人士中的吸引力。

## Interesting Questions:
**Q1:** 考虑到尼基·黑利此前对唐纳德·特朗尔的批评，她的支持可能会如何影响特朗普的竞选活动？
**A1:** 黑利的背书可以帮助弥合共和党内部的分歧，并扩大特朗普在传统保守派中的吸引力。尽管她今年早些时候曾在提名战中批评过特朗普，但这一认可也可能会在党内基层人士中产生善意，并为她自身在2028年的竞选奠定基础。

**Q2:** 尼基·黑利和唐纳德·特朗普之间可能存在哪些政策差异，这些差异又是如何影响她支持特朗普的决定的？
**A2:** 黑利和特朗普的政策分歧主要体现在国内问题上，黑利代表了更传统的保守主义；而在国际事务方面，相比于特朗普的民粹主义立场，她的鹰派倾向也颇为明显。在初选辩论中，黑利曾批评特朗普煽动“混乱”并指责他精神状态下滑。

**Q3:** 尼基·黑利的认可会如何影响乔·拜登的竞选策略，特别是针对温和共和党人的诉求？
**A3:** 在黑利宣布支持特朗普后，拜登阵营可能需要重新评估其吸引不愿看到另一届特朗普政府执政的温和派共和党人的方法。拜登团队发言人迈克尔·泰勒表示，他们与这些选民有着共同的价值观，并强调了他们对民主、联盟和两党合作的承诺，同时拒绝了与唐纳德·特朗普相关的“混乱、分裂和暴力”。

## Summary:
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the UN, has announced her support for **Donald Trump** in his bid for a second term as President of the United States. Despite previously describing him as unfit for office during their Republican nomination fight earlier this year, Haley cited Biden's performance as "a catastrophe" and stated she would be voting for Trump. This backing from a traditional conservative could widen Trump's appeal within the party.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How might Nikki Haley's support impact Donald Trump's campaign, considering her previous criticisms of him?
A1: Nikki Haley's backing may help heal divisions within the Republican Party and widen Trump's appeal to traditional conservatives. Her endorsement could also generate goodwill among the party base and position her for a potential run in 2028, despite previous criticisms of Trump during their nomination fight earlier this year.

Q2: What are some policy differences between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump that may have influenced her decision to support him?
A2: Policy differences between the two include domestic issues where Haley represents a more traditional brand of conservatism, as well as international affairs in which she is hawkish compared to Trump's populism. During the primary contests, Haley criticized Trump for fueling "chaos" and declining mental fitness.

Q3: How might Nikki Haley's endorsement affect Joe Biden's campaign strategy in appealing to moderate Republicans?
A3: With Haley's announcement, the Biden campaign may need to reassess its approach to winning over moderate Republicans who do not want another Trump presidency. Michael Tyler, a spokespader for the Biden campaign, stated that they share values with these voters and emphasized their commitment to democracy, alliances, and bipartisanship while rejecting "chaos, division, and violence" associated with Donald Trump.
