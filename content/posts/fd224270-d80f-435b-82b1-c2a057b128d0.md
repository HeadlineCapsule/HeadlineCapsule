# 杰米·戴蒙表示摩根大通将在五年内选择新首席执行官 

---
华尔街任职时间最长的领导人之一、**摩根大通**（JPMorgan Chase）现任首席执行官 **杰米·戴蒙**（Jamie Dimon）宣布，正在寻找他的继任者，这表明他计划在**五年内**辞去首席执行官一职。鉴于戴蒙的成功任期，谁将取代他的话题一直是美国银行业频繁讨论的主题。摩根大通在其投资者日活动中强调，这一决定取决于该行的董事会，并着重提到了公司内部存在“非常出色的潜在首席执行官人选”。在保持自己的精力和奉献精神的同时，戴蒙承认他离任首席执行官的时间比之前提到的五年期限提前了。一月份，他将三位高管——**珍妮弗·皮普斯扎克**（Jennifer Piepszak）、**玛丽安·莱克**(Marianne Lake) 和 **特洛伊· Rohrbaugh** (Troy Rohrbaugh)—列为接替他的领先候选人。

尽管有一项旨在至少留他在摩根大通任职至2026年中期的留任奖金，但戴蒙最近的言论暗示将提前交接。在投资者活动中，股东询问了该行400亿美元的过剩资本，对此，戴蒙坚称这些资金不会用于以当前价格大量回购股票，而是在可能获得良好回报时进行战略性部署。 戴蒙即将离任的消息和近期没有回购股票的计划导致摩根大通股价周一收盘下跌4.5%。然而，该行预计贷款业务的表现将有所改善，这得益于美联储的利率决定，预计今年收入约为910亿美元

# Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan will pick a new CEO within five years 

---
Jamie **Dimon**, one of Wall Street's longest-serving leaders and current CEO of **JPMorgan Chase**, announced that the search for his successor is underway, indicating that he plans to step down as CEO within **five years**. The topic of Dimon's replacement has been a frequent subject of discussion in the US banking industry, given his successful tenure. At JPMorgan's investor day, Dimon emphasized that the decision lies with the bank's board of directors and highlighted the presence of "really great potential CEOs" within the organization. While he maintains his energy and commitment, Dimon acknowledged that the timeline for his departure as CEO has moved up from the previously mentioned five-year mark. In January, he positioned three executives—Jennifer **Piepszak**, Marianne **Lake** , and Troy **Rohrbaugh** —as leading candidates to take over when he steps down. 

Despite a retention bonus designed to keep him at JPMorgan until at least mid-2026, Dimon's recent statements suggest an earlier transition. At the investor event, shareholders inquired about the bank's excess capital of $40 billion, and Dimon asserted that this capital would not be used for substantial share buybacks at current prices but rather deployed strategically when good returns are possible. The news of Dimon's impending departure and the lack of immediate stock buyback plans caused JPMorgan's stock to close down 4.5% on Monday. Nevertheless, the bank expects improved performance from its lending business due to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, anticipating earnings of about $91 billion this year
