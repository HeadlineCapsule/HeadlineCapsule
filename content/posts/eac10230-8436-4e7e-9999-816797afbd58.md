中国威胁对台湾“分裂分子”执行死刑

# 中国对“台湾独立”的新规定：威胁分裂分子死刑

在中国最近的一项公告中，中国正式将旨在台湾独立的行为定义为刑事犯罪，并威胁要给予包括死刑在内的惩罚。最高人民法院与其他中国政府机构于周五联合宣布了指导方针，以惩罚犯有分裂和煽动分裂罪的“台湾独立”顽固分裂分子。

**关键点：**
- 中国首次根据其法律将台湾独立定义为犯罪行为，严重案件，例如与外部势力勾结策划独立，可判处死刑。
- 由于北京缺乏对台湾的管辖权，这一举措主要是象征性的，但可能会阻止旅行并使台湾公民面临更大的风险。
- 中国坚持认为台湾是中国领土的一部分，而台北拒绝这一说法；中华人民共和国威胁如果台湾不无限期地屈从于其控制，将以武力进行吞并。
- 新的指导方针还可能对与中国有引渡协议的第三国公民和公司产生寒蝉效应。

**影响：**
根据台北淡江大学跨海峡关系专家张五岳的说法，该公告有三个目的：在国内对抗“台湾独立”，声明对台湾的国际管辖权，并威慑台湾人。这些新规则也可能影响与中国有引渡协议的第三国。

**反应：**
台湾政府批评北京的举动是“不文明和粗暴的挑衅”，称这只会挑起台湾海峡两岸人民之间的对抗，严重影响两岸交流。一名台湾高级官员还建议，任何第三国的公民如果为捍卫台湾的自由和民主现状而发言，都可能面临中国刑事起诉的风险。

**背景：**
自台湾新领导人赖清德上个月就职以来，他是一位坚定的台湾实际独立支持者，北京一直增加好战言论并进行军事演习。中国的刑法已经包括了关于分裂的条款，但新的指导方针为在台湾背景下适用刑法具体提供了实践指南。

 **China's New Rules on 'Taiwan Independence': Threatens Death Penalty for Separatists**

In a recent announcement, China has officially defined behavior aimed at Taiwanese independence as a criminal act and threatened punishments up to the death penalty. The Supreme People’s Court, along with other Chinese authorities, jointly announced guidelnates on Friday for punishing "Taiwan Independence" diehard separatists who commit crimes of secession and incitement of secession.

**Key Points:**
- China defines Taiwan independence as a crime under its laws for the first time, with severe cases such as plotting independence with external help subject to death penalty.
- The move is mostly symbolic due to Beijing's lack of jurisdiction over Taiwan but could deter travel and make it riskier for Taiwanese citizens.
- China insists that Taiwan is part of its territory, while Taipei rejects this claim; the People’s Republic of China threatens annexation by force if Taiwan refuses to submit under its control indefinitely.
- The new guidelines could also have a chilling effect on Chinese citizens and companies dealing with Taiwanese individuals who may fall under these provisions.

**Impact:**
The announcement serves three purposes according to Chang Wu-yueh, an expert on cross-Strait relations at Tamkang University in Taipei: domestically countering 'Taiwan independence,' declaring international jurisdiction over Taiwan, and deterring Taiwanese. The new rules may also affect third countries with extradition agreements with China.

**Reactions:**
Taiwan's government has criticized Beijing’s move as an "uncivilised and crude provocation," stating that it will only provoke confrontation between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, seriously affecting cross-Strait exchanges. A senior Taiwanese official also suggested that any citizen of a third country who speaks up in defense of Taiwan's free and democratic status quo could be at risk of Chinese criminal prosecution.

**Background:**
Since Taiwan’s new leader Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwanese de facto independence, took office last month, Beijing has increased bellicose rhetoric and conducted military exercises close to Taiwan. China's criminal code already includes provisions covering secession, but the new guidelines set out practice for applying criminal law specifically in the context of Taiwan.
