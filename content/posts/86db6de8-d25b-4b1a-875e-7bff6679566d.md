# 特朗普的“机会区”计划遭遇投资者热情减退

唐纳德·特朗普政府的标志性经济发展项目——**“机会区”**计划正遭遇投资者兴趣大幅下降。该计划于 2017 年启动，通过提供税收优惠以吸引私人投资进入经济困难地区。然而，最新数据显示，流入**“机会基金”**的股权投资大幅下降，与去年同期相比，今年第一季度下降了三分之二。这种趋势归因于**通货膨胀**、**利率上升**和利润丰厚的**税收优惠**即将在 2026 年到期等因素。

行业内部人士指出，高通胀和利率导致建设和资本成本增加，影响了投资回报。该计划还因有利于富裕投资者和豪华开发项目而受到批评，而不是充分支持低收入社区。一些慈善基金会已经撤回了支持，批评人士认为该计划相当于制定有利于**超高净值人群**的税收法规。

2026 年税收优惠即将到期的最后期限进一步吓退了投资者，人们呼吁延长优惠期限以重振投资者信心。许多“机会基金”现在面临资金短缺难以完成项目，导致投资者采取观望态度。然而，一些机会基金仍然对该行业的前景持乐观态度，特别是在经济适用房领域。

# Investor enthusiasm wanes for Trump's Opportunity Zones

**Opportunity Zones**, a signature economic development programme of the Trump administration, are facing a significant decline in investor interest. The programme, launched in 2017, offered tax incentives to attract private investment to economically distressed areas. However, recent data reveals a sharp drop in equity investment inflows into Opportunity Zone funds, with a two-thirds decline in the first quarter compared to the previous year. This trend is attributed to factors such as **inflation**, **rising interest rates**, and the upcoming expiry of lucrative **tax benefits**.

Industry insiders point to the burden of increased construction and capital costs due to high inflation and interest rates, impacting the returns on investment. The programme also faced scrutiny for benefiting wealthy investors and luxury developments, rather than adequately supporting low-income communities. Some charitable foundations have withdrawn their support, and critics argue that the programme amounts to crafting tax codes to benefit **ultra-high net worth individuals**.

The upcoming deadline for tax benefits in 2026 has further deterred investors, and there are calls for an extension to revive interest. Many Opportunity Zone funds are now facing shortfalls in funding to complete projects, leading to a cautious approach from investors. However, some opportunity funds remain optimistic about the industry's potential, particularly in the affordable housing sector, despite the challenges.
