葛兰素史克将因胃酸药物Zantac面临陪审团审判

# 摘要：Zantac 胃酸抑制剂诉讼案即将开庭审理

这篇文章讨论了即将举行的陪审团审判，涉及超过 72,000 名癌症患者，他们声称胃酸抑制剂 Zantac 导致他们的疾病。该诉讼针对葛兰素史克（GSK）、罗氏制药和 sanofi 等制药公司。

特拉华州法官 Vivian Medinilla 裁定，科学专家的证据可以证明原告的癌症与通过 Zantac 接触 NDMA 有关，这一证据在法庭上可以受理。这一决定使这些公司可能被追究责任，如果陪审团认为他们对原告的癌症负有责任。

文章还强调，开发了 Zantac 的 GSK 和其他公司由于这些案件而遭受了巨大的市值损失。已经达成了一些和解协议，但大多数剩余的诉讼仍在特拉华州法院悬而未决。

问题：

1. NDMA 是什么，为什么与本案有关？
2. Medinilla 法官的裁决如何影响即将举行的 Zantac 相关案件的陪审团审判？
3. 哪些公司卷入了这些诉讼，它们迄今为止的回应是什么？
4. Valisure 对 NDMA 水平的发现对含兰索拉嗪产品有何意义？
5. 投资者如何反应 Zantac 相关案件的潜在责任？

答案：

1. **NDMA**（N-nitrosodimethylamine）是一种可能的致癌物，存在于香烟和加工食品中，以及 Zantac 等含兰索拉嗪产品中高浓度。因为原告声称他们通过 Zantac 接触 NDMA 导致了他们的癌症。
2. Medinilla 法官的裁决允许科学专家在陪审团面前证明原告的癌症与通过 Zantac 接触 NDMA 之间的联系，增加了相关制药公司可能被追究责任的可能性，如果陪审团认为他们负有责任。
3. 卷入这些诉讼的公司包括 GSK（葛兰素史克）、罗氏制药和 sanofi。他们对原告的指控提出异议，但已解决了一些案件，而其他案件仍在待决中。 GSK 宣布计划上诉 Medinilla 法官的裁决。
4. Valisure 是一家位于康涅狄格州的独立实验室，发现 Zantac 等含兰索拉嗪产品中存在“极高水平”的 NDMA。这一发现导致美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）和欧洲药品管理局建议暂停使用这些产品并要求制造商将其撤出市场。
5. 投资者最初忽视了 Zantac 相关案件的潜在责任，直到 2022 年，摩根士丹利发布

**Summary of Article: Jury Trials Set for Heartburn Drug Zantac Lawsuits**

The article discusses upcoming jury trials involving more than  **72,000 cancer sufferers** who allege that the heartburn drug Zantac caused their condition. The lawsuit is against pharmaceutical companies such as GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), Boehringer Ingelheim, and Sanofi.

Judge Vivian Medinilla of Delaware ruled that scientific experts' evidence linking the plaintiffs' cancers to their exposure to NDMA through Zantac would be admissible in court. This decision exposes the companies to potential liability if juries find them responsible for the plaintiffs' cancers.

The article also highlights that GSK, which developed Zantac, and other companies have seen significant losses in market capitalization due to these cases. Some settlements have already been reached, but most of the remaining lawsuits are still pending in Delaware courts.

Questions:
1. What is NDMA, and why is it relevant to this case?
2. How did Judge Medinilla's ruling impact the upcoming jury trials for Zantac-related cases?
3. Which companies are involved in these lawsuits, and what has been their response so far?
4. What was the significance of Valisure's findings on NDMA levels in ranitidine products?
5. How have investors reacted to the potential liability associated with Zantac-related cases?

Answers:
1. **NDMA** (N-nitrosodimethylamine) is a probable human carcinogen found in cigarettes and processed foods, as well as in high levels within ranitidine products like Zantac. It's relevant to this case because the plaintiffs allege that their exposure to NDMA through Zantac caused their cancers.
2. Judge Medinilla's ruling allowed scientific experts to testify before a jury about the link between the plaintiffs' cancers and their exposure to NDMA via Zantac, increasing the likelihood of liability for the pharmaceutical companies involved if found responsible by juries.
3. The companies involved in these lawsuits include GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), Boehringer Ingelheim, and Sanofi. They have disputed the claims made by plaintiffs but have settled several cases while others are still pending. GSK has announced plans to appeal Judge Medinilla's ruling.
4. Valisure, an independent laboratory in Connecticut, discovered "extremely high levels" of NDMA in ranitidine products like Zantac. This finding led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency to recommend suspending the use of these products and request manufacturers to withdraw them from the market.
5. Investors initially overlooked the potential liability associated with Zantac-related cases until 2022, when an analyst note published by Morgan Stanley estimated a possible liability of up to $45 billion. This revelation caused companies linked to the drug to lose a combined value of approximately $40 billion in just days.

**Conclusion:** The article focuses on the impending jury trials for Zantac-related cancer lawsuits, highlighting Judge Medinilla's ruling that allows scientific evidence linking NDMA exposure to plaintiffs' cancers and its potential impact
