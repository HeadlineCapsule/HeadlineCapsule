BDO黑马赢得竞逐英国第五大会计师事务所的胜利。

## 概要：

 **BDO** 的合伙人选举 **马克·肖（Mark Shaw）** 为他们的新的管理合伙人，将于10月接替 **保罗·伊格兰德（Paul Eagland）** 。这一决定让公司内部许多原本期待斯科特·奈特（Scott Knight）获胜的人感到惊讶。BDO在富时上市公司中迅速发展并取得成功，但监管机构对其审计质量问题提出批评。在伊格兰德的领导下，收入显著增加，合伙人数量也有增长。肖在他的合伙人演讲中强调了可控的增长和尊重公司的传统。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 马克·肖对“**可控增长**”的关注将如何影响BDO未来的扩张计划？
   - 通过优先考虑可控增长，马克·肖可能寻求以更可持续、更有节制的方法来扩大公司的服务范围。这可能包括专注于在进入新市场或行业之前改善现有实践。它也可能意味着在承担债务或过度扩展资源时要谨慎行事，这一点可以在经济挑战时期帮助维持稳定性并确保公司的长期成功。

2. BDO的传统在马克·肖对合伙人的演讲中扮演什么角色？
   - 在他的演讲中，马克·肖强调了BDO传统及其合作模式的重要性，以此与公司的合伙人建立情感联系。这一对传统的关注表明他打算在寻求增长机会的同时维护公司的核心价值观和文化。通过突出这一方面，肖很可能旨在让合伙人们放心，任何变化或扩张都将符合BDO既定的身份和原则。

3. 马克·肖将如何解决监管机构关于审计质量问题的批评？
   - 作为 BDO 新的管理合伙人，马克·肖可能会优先考虑提高审计质量以应对监管机构过去的批评。这可能涉及实施更严格的内部控制和监督机制、投资员工培训与发展，或加强与客户的协作，确保各方在审计过程中都清楚自己的责任。通过采取这些措施，肖可以展现出致力于在 BDO 的审计业务中保持高标准的专业性和问责制的承诺。

A1: By prioritizing controlled growth, Mark Shaw may aim for a more sustainable and measured approach to expanding the firm's services.

A2: In his pitch, Mark Shaw emphasized the importance of BDO's heritage and its partnership model as a way to connect emotionally with the firm's partners. This focus on tradition may signal that he intends to preserve the core values and culture of the firm while pursuing growth opportunities. By highlighting this aspect, Shaw likely aimed to reassure partners that any changes or expansions would be in line with BDO's established identity and principles.

Q3: How might Mark Shaw address the criticism from regulators regarding audit quality issues?
A3: As the new managing partner of BDO, Mark Shaw will likely prioritize improving audit quality to address past criticisms from regulators. This could involve implementing stricter internal controls and oversight mechanisms, investing in staff training and development, or enhancing collaboration with clients to ensure that all parties are aware of their responsibilities during the auditing process. By taking these steps, Shaw can demonstrate a commitment to maintaining high standards of professionalism and accountability within BDO's audit practice.
