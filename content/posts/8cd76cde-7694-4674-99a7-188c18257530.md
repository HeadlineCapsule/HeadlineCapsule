# 我们的经济现实感是如何被扭曲的

本文探讨了**媒体消费**以及它对公众对经济问题理解的影响，认为**大众媒体时代**对我们对世界的感知产生了复杂且有时是有害的影响。作者强调了**新闻报道**中的一种“引人注目的负面偏差”，特别是在**犯罪**和**经济**方面，这可能扭曲了人们对现实的感知。

对人们所感知个人财务状况与他们对国民经济看法的差异进行了分析，后一种看法要负面得多。这在部分程度上归因于**媒体行业**的激励机制，其中优先考虑的是“让观众粘在屏幕上”，导致负面新闻成为焦点，并可能扭曲了我们对经济现实的感知。文章举了**福克斯新闻**的一个例子，在汽油泵价格创纪录期间，近80%的节目都提到了高汽油价格。

本文还讨论了以**社交媒体**作为主要新闻来源所带来的挑战，其自身的驱动参与度算法进一步凸显了负面标题和负面消息。作者得出结论，媒体消费与公众对经济问题理解之间的复杂相互作用是一个持续存在的问题，影响着政治动态，并可能削弱人们对积极经济指标的信心。

# How our sense of economic reality is being distorted 

**Media consumption** and its impact on public understanding of economic issues are explored in this article, arguing that the **age of mass media** has had a complex and sometimes detrimental effect on our perception of the world. The author highlights a "striking negativity bias" in **news reporting**, particularly regarding **crime** and the **economy**, which may be distorting people's sense of reality.

The analysis presented examines the disparity between people's perception of their personal financial situation and their view of the national economy, with the latter being far more negative. This is attributed in part to the incentives of the **media industry**, where "keeping the viewer glued to the screen" is prioritized, leading to a focus on negative news and a potential warping of our sense of economic reality. The example of **Fox News** is given, where high petrol prices were mentioned in almost 80% of programs during a period of record pump prices.

The article also discusses the challenge of **social media** as a primary news source, with its own engagement-driven algorithms, further contributing to the prominence of negative headlines and stories. The author concludes that the complex interplay between media consumption and public understanding of economic issues is an ongoing concern, impacting political dynamics and potentially undermining faith in positive economic indicators.
