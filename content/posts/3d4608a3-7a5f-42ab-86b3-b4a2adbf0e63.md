# 乔·拜登与唐纳德·特朗普竞相展示谁对中国更强硬

**乔·拜登** 和 **唐纳德·特朗普** ，2024年**白宫** 的竞争对手，正在中国贸易政策问题上展开激烈交锋。两位候选人都提议提高关税，尽管这可能带来通胀后果。拜登最近宣布对中国特定行业商品征收新关税，将**贸易**和**保护主义**置于总统选举的核心，尤其是在拥有大量**蓝领工人**的关键工业州。特朗普则承诺在潜在的第二任期内进一步提高关税，在面对中国日益壮大的制造业时，双方竞争谁能显得更能保护美国就业。这种动态导致经济和政治利益的复杂交织，两位候选人都在**保护主义**和通胀担忧之间进行权衡。

拜登的最新举措延续并扩大了特朗普最初的关税范围，目标行业包括清洁能源、半导体和金属，同时强调这些政策对国内制造业和供应链稳定的影响。此举引发了各利益相关方不同的回应，批评者认为关税将不利于消费者并损害清洁能源努力，而两党的议员都敦促对中国竞争采取更强硬的行动。拜登政府则辩护称其做法是一种平衡的战略，在选举年考虑了经济、能源和外交等多重目标。

# Joe Biden and Donald Trump battle to prove who can be toughest on China

**Joe Biden** and **Donald Trump**, the 2024 rivals for the White House, are engaging in a clash over trade policies with China, with both candidates proposing higher tariffs despite potential inflationary consequences. Biden's recent announcement of new tariffs on specific sectors of Chinese goods has placed **trade** and **protectionism** at the center of the presidential race, particularly in key industrial states with large numbers of **blue-collar workers**. Trump has countered with promises of even higher tariffs in a potential second term, creating a competition to appear as the strongest protector of American jobs in the face of China's growing manufacturing sector. This dynamic has led to a complex interplay of economic and political interests, with both candidates navigating between protectionism and inflation concerns. 

Biden's latest move maintains and expands upon Trump's initial tariffs, targeting sectors such as clean energy, semiconductors, and metals, while also highlighting the impact of these policies on domestic manufacturing and supply chain stability. This has prompted responses from various stakeholders, including critics who argue that the tariffs will negatively impact consumers and clean energy efforts, as well as lawmakers from both parties urging more aggressive action against Chinese competition. The Biden administration, however, defends its approach as a balanced strategy that considers economic, energy, and diplomatic goals during an election year.
