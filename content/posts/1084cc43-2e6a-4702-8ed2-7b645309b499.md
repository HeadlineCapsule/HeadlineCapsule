美国最高法院的错误似乎表明爱达荷州堕胎禁令受挫

**美国最高法院的错误显示爱达荷州堕胎禁令受挫**

一份由彭博社获得的文件表明，由于在涉及生殖权利的高知名度案件中出现明显错误，美国最高法院可能会授权在爱达荷州进行紧急堕胎。泄露的草案意见表明，法院九名大法官中的多数票决定通过将该案驳回为“未经慎重授予”来阻止爱达荷州几乎完全禁止堕胎。

这一事件是近年来第二次提前透露有关堕胎的裁决草案，加剧了围绕有争议案件的紧张局势。如果最高法院最终允许在爱达荷州进行紧急堕胎，这将被视为乔·拜登总统及其将堕胎权利作为2024年总统竞选主要问题的民主党的胜利。

该案源于美国政府对爱达荷州提起的诉讼，声称其几乎完全禁止堕胎违反了《联邦紧急医疗治疗和劳动法》（EMTALA），该法要求医院在紧急情况下提供稳定治疗。泄露的文件表明，多数大法官可能支持美国政府的论点，根据《EMTALA》准则，可以对爱达荷州的堕胎禁令做出例外。

目前尚不清楚这是否是最终裁决版本，或者在正式发布前是否会进一步修订。最高法院尚未就此事发表声明，并计划在本周晚些时候发布更多决定，因为法院即将结束任期。

 **US Supreme Court Error Reveals Setback for Idaho Abortion Ban**

A document obtained by Bloomberg suggests that the US Supreme Court may authorize emergency abortions in the state of Idaho, following an apparent error involving a high-profile case over reproductive rights. The leaked draft opinion indicates that a majority of the court's nine justices voted to block a near-total ban on abortions in Idaho by dismissing the case as "improvidently granted."

The incident marks the second time in recent years that a draft ruling on abortion has been prematurely revealed, raising tensions surrounding divisive cases. If the Supreme Court ultimately allows emergency abortions in Idaho, it would be seen as a win for President Joe Biden's administration and Democrats who have made abortion access a major issue for the 2amo presidential campaign.

The case originates from a lawsuit filed by the US government against the state of Idaho, arguing that its near-total abortion ban violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment in emergencies. The leaked document suggests that a majority of justices may side with the US government's argument, potentially allowing for exceptions to Idaho's abortion ban under EMTALA guidelines.

It remains unclear whether this is the final version of the decision or if further revisions will be made before its official release. The Supreme Court has yet to issue a statement on the matter and plans to release more decisions later in the week as it nears the end of its term.
