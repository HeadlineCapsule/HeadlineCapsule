大多数英国养老基金落后于指数追踪器

## 摘要：
一项分析显示，过去十年中，**以英国为重点的养老金投资**的表现比 FTSE 全股指数追踪器差了 20% 以上，这些基金中有约 50 亿英镑的储蓄者资金。在所研究的 208 个养老基金中，大多数（10 个中有 9 个）都是主动管理的，其表现至少比 FTSE 全股指数追踪器差了 10%。一些表现最差的基金已不再向新业务开放，其中标准人寿/永明高收益基金在十年中的回报仅为 13%，而 iShares 英国股票指数追踪器的回报则为 73%。

研究表明，许多这些表现不佳的基金是在英国追踪基金尚未广泛普及时成立的。这些“隐形追踪器”主要遵循一项指数，但收费与主动基金相似，至少比追踪基金高出四倍。金融行为监管局（FCA）宣布了新的消费者职责法规，自 2021 年 7 月起适用于封闭式养老金基金，旨在确保更好的资金价值和绩效透明度。

## 有趣的问题：
问题：哪些因素导致了以英国为重点的养老金投资表现比 FTSE 全股指数追踪器差？
答案：分析表明，许多这些基金是在英国追踪基金尚未广泛普及时成立的。这些“隐形追踪器”主要遵循一项指数，但收费与主动基金相似，这导致储蓄者投资于这些基金的资金遭受了显著的损失。

问题：新的消费者职责法规如何解决封闭式养老金基金的问题？
答案：金融行为监管局（FCA）的新消费者职责法规旨在确保封闭式养老金计划中储蓄者的更好资金价值和绩效透明度。这些法规旨在为工作场所养老基金提供的长期价值提供更多清晰度，并帮助消费者对其退休储蓄做出更明智的决定。

问题：尽管主动管理的英国股票基金表现不如追踪基金，但它们是否有任何潜在的好处？
答案：前养老金部长罗斯·阿尔特曼男爵夫人认为，对主动管理的批评可能“过于严厉”。她提出，指数追踪基金只是多元化投资组合的一部分，一些主动管理者即使在扣除费用后也能创造价值。尽管本文重点关注表现不佳的以英国为重点的养老金投资，但考虑主动管理基金在某些市场条件或特定投资策略下的潜在好处是很重要的。

## Summary:
An analysis has revealed that **UK-focused pension investments** have underperformed by more than 20% compared to a FTSE All-Share tracker over the past decade, with around £5bn of savers' cash in these funds. The majority (9 out of 10) of the 208 pension funds examined were actively managed and underperformed by at least 10%. Some of the worst-performing funds are now closed to new business, with Standard Life/Invesco Perpetual High Income amooring a return of just 13% over ten years compared to an iShares UK equity index tracker's 73%.

The research suggests that many of these underperforming funds were established when tracker funds were not widely available in the UK. These "closet trackers" largely follow an index but charge fees similar to active funds, which can be at least four times higher than those for a tracker fund. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced new Consumer Duty regulations that will apply to closed-book pension funds from July 2021, aimed at ensuring better value for money and transparency in performance.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: What factors contributed to the underperformance of UK-focused pension investments compared to a FTSE All-Share tracker?
A: The analysis indicates that many of these funds were established when tracker funds were not widely available in the UK. These "closet trackers" largely follow an index but charge fees similar to active funds, which can be at least four times higher than those for a tracker fund. This combination of high fees and underperformance has resulted in significant losses for savers' cash invested in these funds.

Q: How do the new Consumer Duty regulations aim to address issues with closed-book pension funds?
A: The FCA's new Consumer Duty regulations, which will apply from July 2021, are designed to ensure better value for money and transparency in performance for savers in closed-book pension plans. These regulations aim to provide greater clarity on the long-term value delivered by workplace pension funds and help consumers make more informed decisions about their retirement savings.

Q: Are there any potential benefits of actively managed UK equity funds, despite their underperformance compared to tracker funds?
A: Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, argues that the criticism of active management may be "overdone." She suggests that index tracker funds are only one part of a diversified portfolio and some active managers can add value even after fees. While this article focuss on underperforming UK-focused pension investments, it is essential to consider the potential benefits of actively managed funds in certain market conditions or for specific investment strategies.
