# **美国防长劳埃德·奥斯汀将于本月与中国 counterpart 会晤**

**美国国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀** 将于本月晚些时候在新加坡与他的中国 counterpart[**将军魏凤和**] 举行面对面会晤，这是两国恢复外交关系的重要一步。此前两国关系紧张，尤其在 **美国众议院议长南希·佩洛西 2022 年访问台湾** 之后，中国中断了与美国的军事沟通。

根据知情人士透露，奥斯汀和魏凤和在 [**“香格里拉对话” 国防论坛**] 上举行的会晤，将履行 **中国国家主席习近平和美国总统乔·拜登** 去年 11 月在旧金山峰会上达成的稳定关系协议。

另一个积极的迹象是，负责印度太平洋事务的顶级五角大楼官员 **伊利·拉特纳** 与 [**中央军委国际军事合作办公室**] 主任 **李屹少将** 通话，这是双方官员自 2019 年以来的首次交流。美国国防部官员强调，开放的沟通渠道对于防止竞争升级为冲突至关重要。

虽然两国关系仍然紧张，北京对拜登最近对中国产品征收关税表示愤怒，但两国军事关系出现稳定的迹象。中国最近避免了在南海采取针对美国间谍飞机的攻击性行动，五角大楼对中国在菲律宾专属经济区内的活动表示担忧。专家认为奥斯汀-魏凤和会晤将强化美国在台湾和南中国海问题上的立场，并希望在对话之后能够进一步接触。

# US defence chief Lloyd Austin to meet Chinese counterpart this month

**US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin** and his Chinese counterpart, **General Wei Fenghe**, will hold an in-person meeting in Singapore later this month, marking a significant step in restoring diplomatic ties between the two nations. This development comes after a period of strained relations, particularly following **then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's** visit to Taiwan in 2022, which prompted China to sever military communications with the US. 

The meeting between Austin and Wei, confirmed by people familiar with the matter, will take place at the **Shangri-La Dialogue defense forum**. It fulfills an agreement made between **Chinese President Xi Jinping** and **US President Joe Biden** during their summit in San Francisco last November, aimed at stabilizing relations. 

In another positive sign, **Ely Ratner**, the top Pentagon official for the Indo-Pacific, held a call with **Major General Li Bin**, head of the **Central Military Commission's international military cooperation office**, marking the first exchange between these officials since 2019. A US defense official emphasized the importance of open lines of communication to prevent competition from escalating into conflict. 

While tensions remain high, with Beijing expressing anger over Biden's recent tariffs on Chinese products, there are signs of stabilization in military relations. China has recently refrained from aggressive actions around US spy planes in the South China Sea, and the Pentagon has expressed concerns about Chinese activities in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. Experts believe the Austin-Wei meeting will reinforce US messages on Taiwan and the South China Sea, with hopes for further engagement following the dialogue.
