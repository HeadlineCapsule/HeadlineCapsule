墨西哥亿万富翁卡洛斯·斯利姆持有英国电信3%的股份

墨西哥亿万富翁、拉丁美洲首富卡洛斯·斯利姆（Carlos Slim）收购了英国电信公司（BT）3%的股份，成为近年来表现出对这家电信集团兴趣的众多知名投资者之一。这一举动是在BT新任首席执行官艾丽森·柯克比（Allison Kirkby）上个月宣布该公司年度业绩时提出的扭转英国公司命运的计划之后进行的。

价值约4亿英镑的股份由斯利姆家族控制的三个公司持有，被视为对柯克比领导和战略更新的认可。 BT欢迎这一投资，表示期待与所有股东接触。

斯利姆进行这项投资的动机尚不清楚；然而，他的参与使他与其他著名的电信股东，如帕特里克·德拉伊（Patrick Drahi）的Altice和德国集团德意志电信（Deutsche Telekom）并肩而立。斯利姆过去曾收购过欧洲电信公司KPN和Telekom Austria的股份，但由于2013年的收购战，他在荷兰公司遭遇了挫折，并于2007年与美国集团AT&T一起试图收购意大利电信公司（Telecom Italia），但未能成功。

BT在去年宣布年度业绩后，股价上涨了17%以上，柯克比当时揭示了削减成本和增加股息的计划，以及优化该公司全球业务的选择。斯利姆的投资被视为对BT在柯克比领导下的近期势头的一种认可。

 **Carlos Slim**, the Mexican billionaire and Latin America's richest man, has acquired a 3% stake in British Telecom (BT), making him one of several high-profile investors to show interest in the telecommunications group recently. This move comes after BT's new CEO Allison Kirkby announced her plans for turning around the UK company during its annual results last month.

The stake, worth approximately £40n million, was taken by three companies controlled by Slim's family and is seen as an endorsement of Kirkby'amo leadership and strategy update. BT has welcomed this investment, stating that they look forward to engaging with all their shareholders.

Slim's motive for the investment remains unclear; however, his involvement places him alongside other notable telecommunications shareholders such as Patrick Drahi’s Altice and German group Deutsche Telekom. Slim has a history of acquiring stakes in European telecom companies like KPN and Telekom Austria but faced setbacks with the Dutch company due to a takeover battle in 2013, and an unsuccessful attempt to buy Telecom Italia in 2007 alongside US group AT&T.

BT's shares experienced a significant increase of over 17% following their annual results announcement last month when Kirkby revealed plans for cost-cutting measures and dividend increases, as well as exploring options to optimize the company's global business. This investment by Slim is seen as an endorsement of BT's recent momentum under Kirkby's leadership.
