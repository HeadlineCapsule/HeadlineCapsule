# Lex 通讯：评估采矿巨额交易回归

**必和必拓拟收购英美资源，表明战略转向** **铜** **资源，不再侧重于钢铁制造类大宗商品，但交易结构和英美资源复杂的业务组合带来挑战。**

采矿巨头必和必拓（BHP）和英美资源（Anglo American）的潜在合并已震动了整个行业，标志着该行业**巨额交易**的回归。必和必拓提出的 310 亿英镑全股收购要约表明公司战略转向**铜**，不再侧重于**钢铁制造类大宗商品**，但同时也引发了关于交易结构和英美资源多元化业务组合未来的问题。

这并非必和必拓首次寻求重大收购。2008 年，该公司对力拓（Rio Tinto）长达一年的追求以失败告终，转而在美国页岩气领域进行了**糟糕的收购**。这段历史凸显了潜在风险，也表明了采取纪律严明的办法的必要性。

目前的拟议交易面临重大障碍。英美资源董事会不太可能接受一种结构，即要求他们承担分拆持股的风险和负担**英美铂金**和**坤巴铁矿**。必和必拓可能需要重组交易并承担更多风险，以收购英美资源颇具吸引力的铜资产。

英美资源本身是一个复杂的实体，其广泛的业务组合包括在南非的业务，而必和必拓已经在那里遇到挑战。最终，该交易可能取决于投资者相信哪支团队能够**拆分**并从采矿业务中释放价值。英美资源的管理层也需要提出一个有说服力的**防御计划**，可能包括运营改善和结构性变革，以释放资本用于**铜矿业务发展**和其他战略项目。

该交易的潜在好处在于必和必拓相信，只有最大的采矿公司才有资源和资本成本来承担大规模的**绿色领域勘探**和开发项目，这些项目对**能源转型**至关重要。然而，此次收购也面临内部挑战，因为必和必拓的股东可能会质疑价格以及英美资源的资产是否符合必和必拓严格的标准。

由于交易规模和复杂性，其他公司**反竞价收购**英美资源的可能性很小。尽管其他采矿集团也觊觎英美资源的铜矿，但必和必拓的规模和财务实力使其成为强劲的竞争对手。

在迈阿密举行的美国银行会议期间，采矿业界将此拟议合并作为关键讨论议题。会议结果将对该行业和采矿超级巨头的前景产生重大影响。

# The Lex Newsletter: Sizing up the return of mining megadeals

**BHP's proposed acquisition of Anglo American signals a shift towards copper and away from steel-making commodities, but the deal structure and Anglo's complex portfolio present challenges.** 

The potential merger between mining giants BHP and Anglo American has sent shockwaves through the industry, marking the return of **megadeals** in the sector. BHP's £31bn all-stock approach signals a **strategic shift** towards **copper** and away from **steel-making commodities**, but it also raises questions about deal structure and the future of Anglo's diverse portfolio. 

This is not the first time BHP has pursued a major acquisition. In 2008, the company's year-long pursuit of Rio Tinto collapsed, and they instead embarked on **ill-fated acquisitions** in US shale. This history underscores the potential risks and the need for a disciplined approach. 

The current proposal faces significant obstacles. Anglo's board is unlikely to accept a structure that requires them to bear the risk and burden of spinning off their stakes in **Anglo American Platinum** and **Kumba Iron Ore**. BHP may need to restructure the deal and take on more risk to acquire Anglo's coveted copper assets. 

Anglo American itself is a complex entity, with a wide-ranging portfolio that includes exposure to South Africa, where BHP has already encountered challenges. The deal may ultimately come down to which team investors trust to **dismember** and unlock value from the miner. Anglo's management will also need to present a compelling **defence plan**, likely involving operational improvements and structural changes to free up capital for **copper growth** and other strategic projects. 

The potential benefits of the deal lie in BHP's belief that only the biggest mining companies will have the resources and cost of capital to take on large-scale **greenfield exploration** and development projects, which are crucial for the **energy transition**. However, the acquisition also faces internal challenges, as BHP shareholders may question the price and the fit of Anglo's assets with BHP's exacting standards. 

The possibility of a **counterbid** for Anglo seems remote, given the size and complexity of the deal. While other mining groups covet Anglo's copper mines, BHP's size and financial heft make it a formidable competitor. 

As the mining world gathers in Miami for the Bank of America conference, the proposed merger will be a key topic of discussion. The outcome will have significant implications for the industry and the future of mining supermajors.
