# 星木 100 亿美元房地产基金利用信贷额度应对投资者撤资 

**星木房地产投资信托（*Sreit*）**，一家 100 亿美元的美国**房地产基金**，正面临流动性问题，因为投资者要求大量赎回。自 2023 年初以来，Sreit 已从其信贷额度中提款超过 13 亿美元以满足这些要求。随着仅剩下约 2.25 亿美元的现金，该基金可能会在今年下半年面临现金短缺。不断上升的**利率**和对**房地产估值**的担忧加剧了这一局势。在加息之前，星木基金与**黑石集团**（*Blackstone Group*）管理的一项类似基金一起，大量投资于**商业地产**，为其私募股权所有者赚取了大量费用。与公开交易的房地产信托不同，私募**房地产投资信托（*Reits*）**可以控制提款并避免消防甩卖，但投资者仍从这两项基金中撤回了数十亿美元。星木公布的**净资产价值**自其 2022 年的峰值下跌了 16% 以上，其 150 亿美元的**债务负担**使其**杠杆率**约为公开同行的两倍。这一情况凸显了人们对私募房地产投资信托行业流动性和估值方面日益增长的担忧。

# Starwood's $10bn Property Fund Taps Credit Line as Investors Pull Money 

**Starwood Real Estate Investment Trust (Sreit)**, a $10 billion US **property fund**, is facing liquidity issues as investors have been requesting heavy redemptions. Since the beginning of 2023, Sreit has drawn more than $1.3 billion from its credit facilities to meet these requests. With only about $225 million in cash left, the fund is facing a potential cash crunch in the second half of the year. The situation is exacerbated by rising **interest rates** and concerns over **real estate valuations**. Starwood's fund, along with a similar fund managed by **Blackstone Group**, invested heavily in **commercial property** just before the rate hikes, generating substantial fees for their private equity owners. Private **Reits**, unlike publicly traded property trusts, can control withdrawals and avoid fire sales, but investors have still pulled billions from both funds. Starwood's declared **net asset value** has dropped by over 16% from its 2022 peak, and its high **debt load** of $15 billion leaves it with a **leverage ratio** roughly twice that of public peers. The situation highlights the growing concerns about liquidity and valuation in the private Reit sector.
