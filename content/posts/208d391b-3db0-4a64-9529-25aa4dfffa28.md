# 中国最大的银行首次发行特殊吸收损失债券 

**中国顶级银行**，包括中国工商银行和银行中国，已开始销售一种独特的债务工具，称为**全部损失吸收能力（TLAC）债券**。此举符合旨在加强银行**资产负债表**并防止**2008 年金融危机**重演的**国际监管要求**。这些债券的发行是确保银行具有足够损失吸收能力，重点是保护**存款人**和其他敏感债务的更广泛举措的一部分。 

中国银行业是全球按资产计算规模最大的银行业，有着五家机构被**金融稳定理事会（FSB）**指定为**具有全球系统重要性**。为满足 FSB 的要求，这些银行必须在 2025 年之前达到相当于**风险加权资产 16%**的**总损失吸收能力**。这促使了资本发行模式的转变，大多数发行现在发生在中国大陆，而不是国际市场。 

COVID-19 大流行和相关的市场条件可能导致中国最初的 TLAC 债券发行推迟。此外，在此期间，该国的金融体系变得相对封闭，跨境活动减少，经济气候因房地产市场长期放缓而充满挑战。国际银行在维持其在大陆市场的突出存在方面面临障碍，该市场主要由国内证券公司和经纪公司控制。 

中国最大的银行成功发行 TLAC 债券，标志着在履行国际监管标准和加强全球金融体系韧性方面迈出了重要一步。

# China's Biggest Banks Launch First Sales of Special Loss-Absorbing Debt 

**China's top banks**, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China, have initiated the sale of a unique type of debt instrument known as **total-loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) bonds**. This move is aligned with **international regulatory requirements** aimed at fortifying bank **balance sheets** and preventing a recurrence of the **2008 financial crisis**. The issuance of these bonds is part of a broader push to ensure that banks have sufficient loss-absorbing capacity, with a particular focus on protecting **depositors** and other sensitive liabilities. 

/n/n

China's banking sector, the world's largest by assets, has a significant global impact, with five of its institutions designated as **globally systemically important** by the **Financial Stability Board (FSB)**. To meet FSB requirements, these banks must attain a **total loss-absorbing capacity** equivalent to **16% of risk-weighted assets** by 2025. This has prompted a shift in capital issuance patterns, with most issuances now occurring within mainland China rather than internationally. 

/n/n

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated market conditions may have contributed to delays in China's initial TLAC bond offerings. Additionally, the country's financial system has become relatively more insular during this period, with a decline in cross-border activity and a challenging economic climate due to the prolonged property slowdown. International banks have faced obstacles in maintaining a prominent presence in the mainland market, which is predominantly controlled by domestic securities firms and brokerages. 

/n/n

The successful issuance of TLAC bonds by China's largest banks marks a significant step toward fulfilling international regulatory standards and bolstering the resilience of the global financial system.
