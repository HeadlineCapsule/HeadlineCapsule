赛诺菲推进200亿欧元的消费保健业务分拆

# 法国制药公司 sanofi 的 200 亿欧元消费者医疗保健业务分拆

Sanofi，一家法国制药公司，正在推进分拆其消费者医疗保健部门的计划。这项交易可能是今年欧洲最大的交易之一，该业务的估值可能约为 **200 亿欧元**。此过程将涉及来自高盛、摩根士丹利、法国巴黎银行、美国银行和罗斯柴尔德银行的银行家，他们将致力于在年底之前完成销售流程并准备公开上市。

消费者部门占 Sanofi 销售额的 10%，并吸引了潜在私募股权竞标者的兴趣。欧洲 IPO 市场正在显示出复苏的迹象，瑞士皮肤护理公司 Galderma 和德国美容零售商 Douglas 在 3 月的上市都取得了成功（后者的上市不太成功）。

Sanofi 计划在 2024 年第四季度或更早时分拆其消费者医疗保健业务，从而创建一家总部位于法国的上市公司。这一举措与其他大型制药公司如葛兰素史克 (GSK) 和强生 (Johnson & Johnson) 的类似行动一致，它们已分拆利润较低的消费者业务，以专注于创新新药，获得更高回报。

Sanofi 首席执行官 Paul Hudson 相信，分拆这两个部门将对双方都有利：Sanofi 可集中精力开发罕见疾病和免疫学治疗方法，而消费者部门则可更快地管理自己的业务并根据需要进行收购。

该公司仍依赖其肺部哮喘药物 Dupixent，该药物在 2023 年产生了 107 亿欧元的销售额。Sanofi 正寻求获得该药物的新批准，用于治疗慢性阻塞性肺疾病 (COPD)。美国食品药品监督管理局 (FDA) 在批准 Dupixent 的更广泛用途之前要求提供更多信息，而欧洲药品管理局则对 COPD 治疗提出了初步建议。

**Summary of the Article: Sanofi's €20bn Consumer Healthcare Spin-off**

Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical company, is moving forward with plans to spin off its consumer healthcare division. This deal could be one of Europe's largest this year and may value the business at around **€20 billion**. The process will involve bankers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, and Rothschild working on a sale process and preparations for a public listing expected to take place by the end of the year.

The consumer division accounts for 10% of Sanofe's sales and has attracted interest from potential private equity bidders. The European IPO market is showing signs of recovery, with successful listings like Swiss skincare company Galderma and a less successful debut by German beauty retailer Douglas in March.

Sanofi plans to separate its consumer healthcare business in the fourth quarter of 2024 at the earliest, creating a publicly listed entity headquartered in France. This move follows similar actions from other Big Pharma companies like GSK and Johnson & Johnson, who have spun off their low-margin consumer businesses to focus on innovative new medicines with higher returns.

Sanofi's CEO Paul Hudson believes that separating the two divisions will benefit both entities: Sanofi can concentrate on developing treatments for rare diseases and immunology, while the consumer division can manage its own business at a faster pace and make acquisitions as needed.

The company remains reliant on its blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent, which generated €10.7 billion in sales in 2023. Sanofi is seeking new approvals for the drug to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The FDA has requested more information before granting broader use of Dupixent, while the European Medicines Agency gave a preliminary recommendation for COPD treatment.

2. **Why is Sanofi separating its consumer healthcare division?**
