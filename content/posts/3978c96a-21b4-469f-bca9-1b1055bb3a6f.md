# 欧盟对元宇宙公司发起调查，关注儿童社交媒体成瘾问题

**欧盟委员会对** **元宇宙（Meta）公司** **展开深入调查**，该公司是社交媒体平台 Facebook 和 Instagram 的母公司。此次调查的重点关注点是儿童的 **精神健康** 和 **网络隐私保护**。调查将深入研究元宇宙公司是否采取了足够的措施来防止儿童沉迷其平台，以及确保儿童的隐私和安全。

**该调查基于欧盟的《数字服务法案》（DSA）**，该法案旨在规范网络内容并保护未成年人。欧盟采取强硬立场，要求网络平台对年轻用户的福祉负责，对屡教不改的违法者将处以高额罚款或甚至禁止其进入市场。

**欧盟专员蒂埃里·布雷顿（Thierry Breton）** 表示，欧盟 "不相信" 元宇宙公司遵守了《数字服务法案》规定的义务，以减轻其平台对年轻用户身体和精神健康的潜在负面影响。调查还将仔细审查元宇宙公司的年龄验证工具和针对未成年人的隐私设置。

欧盟通过此次调查向外界传递了一个明确的信息，那就是欧盟致力于保护儿童免受社交媒体成瘾和网络内容潜在伤害。调查结果将受到全球监管机构、公司和用户的密切关注。

元宇宙公司过去曾因对社会的影响受到批评，此次调查也加大了该公司解决这些问题的压力。欧盟严格执行《数字服务法案》，体现了欧盟要求科技公司对其用户福祉负责的决心。

# EU launches probe into Meta over social media addiction in children

**The European Commission has launched an in-depth investigation** into Meta, the company that owns social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, over concerns about the protection of children's **mental health** and **online privacy**. The probe will focus on whether Meta is taking sufficient measures to prevent children from becoming addicted to its platforms and ensure their privacy and safety. 

**The investigation falls under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA)**, which aims to regulate online content and protect minors. With the potential for significant fines or even market bans for repeat offenders, the EU is taking a strong stance on holding online platforms accountable for their impact on young users. 

**EU Commissioner Thierry Breton** stated that the EU was "not convinced" that Meta has complied with its obligations under the DSA to mitigate potential negative effects on young users' physical and mental health. The investigation will also scrutinize Meta's age-verification tools and privacy settings for minors. 

With this probe, the EU is sending a clear message that it is committed to protecting children from the potential harms of social media addiction and online content. The investigation is currently underway, and the results will be closely watched by regulators, companies, and users worldwide.

Meta has faced scrutiny in the past over its impact on society, and this investigation adds to the growing pressure on the company to address these concerns. The EU's aggressive enforcement of the DSA underscores the bloc's determination to hold tech companies accountable for their users' well-being.
