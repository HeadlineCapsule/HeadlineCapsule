菲律宾秘密加固南海争议海域船只

# 翻译：

**摘要：**
在有消息称菲律宾位于南中国海争议性第二托马斯礁（Sierra Madre）的军舰存在结构性危险后，菲律宾秘密加强了该军舰的加固。这一举动被视为对北京日益强硬行为的回应。北京反对马尼拉对该礁的主权声索，并阻碍了驻军海军陆战队船上的补给任务。

**要点：**
- 塞拉玛德丽（Sierra Madre）军舰是为了加强菲律宾对领土的主权声索而故意在1999年搁浅的，但现在面临着结构性解体危险。
- 中国质疑马尼拉对第二托马斯礁的主权，并使用暴力战术阻止驻军海军陆战队船上的补给任务。
- 2016年国际法庭驳回了北京的主张，称其对菲律宾专属经济区内的该区域无合法权利。
- 马尼拉坚持其加固努力是人道主义的，旨在为驻军人员提供体面的生活空间。然而，中国指责马尼拉带来建筑材料以加强军舰在礁上的位置。
- 美国已警告北京，他们与菲律宾的互防条约适用于塞拉玛德丽（Sierra Madre）的情况，如果有必要，可能会考虑直接参与补给行动。

**影响：**
围绕第二托马斯礁的紧张局势升级，引发了中国和菲律宾之间可能发生武装冲突的担忧，以及美国根据其互防条约可能进行干预的可能性。菲律宾领导人最近警告说，任何导致菲律宾人伤亡的中国行动都将被视为战争行为，这进一步突显了局势的严重性。

 **Summary:** 
The Philippines has secretly reinforced the Sierra Madre warship on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea amid rising concerns that it was at risk of breaking apart. This move is seen as a response to increasing aggressive actions by Beijing, which opposes Manila's claim over the reef and has been blocking resupply missions for stationed Marines on the ship.

**Key Points:**
- The Sierra Madre warship was intentionally run aground in 1amo to reinforce the Philippines' territorial claim, but is now at risk of disintegration.
- China disputes Manila's sovereignty over the Second Thomas Shoal and has been using violent tactics to prevent resupply missions for stationed Marines on the ship.
- The 2016 international tribunal rejected Beijing's claims, stating that it had no legal rights to the region within the Philippine exclusive economic zone.
- Manila insists its reinforcement efforts are humanitarian in nature and aimed at providing a decent living space for stationed personnel. However, China accuses Manila of bringing construction materials to strengthen the ship's position on the reef.
- The US has warned Beijing that their mutual defense treaty with the Philippines applies to the Sierra Madre situation and may consider direct involvement in resupply operations if necessary.

**Implications:**
The escalating tensions around the Second Thomas Shoal raise concerns about a potential armed conflict between China and the Philippines, as well as possible US intervention under their mutual defense treaty. The Philippine leader's recent warning that any Chinese action resulting in Filipino casualties would be considered an act of war further underscores the gravity of the situation.
