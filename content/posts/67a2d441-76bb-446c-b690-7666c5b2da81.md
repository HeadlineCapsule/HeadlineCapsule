摩根大通从富有的客户那里带来了超过150亿美元的资金，这些客户希望减少税收负担。

**摩根大通** 成功地从富裕客户那里吸引了超过150亿美元的资金，将其税收战略业务，旨在从竞争对手**高盛资产管理**和**摩根士丹利参数平台**中夺取更多的市场份额。该银行专注于提供像税收损失收获这样的服务通过单独管理的账户（SMA），允许投资者降低他们的税收账单同时表达具体的偏好，例如青睐环境、社会和治理因素。

在过去的两年里，摩根大通加大了在这方面的努力，为客户的投资组合出售亏损股票，导致SMA资产显著增长。根据Cerulli Associates的数据，SMA资产从2022年的1.7万亿美元增长到2023年的2.2万亿美元，增长了近30%。税收损失收获已经成为资产管理者中的一项标准做法，因为投资者在市场波动和强劲回报的背景下寻求税收优惠。

尽管摩根大通取得了增长，但它仍然落后于**高盛资产管理**，后者拥有约2800亿美元的税收意识策略，而**摩根士丹利参数平台**则是直接索引领域的领导者。其他参与者，如黑石、万豪、安本标准和全春全球投资也已经采取了重大举措，以利用通过SMA对个性化、税收高效投资组合日益增长的需求。

总之，摩根大通在税收战略业务方面取得了长足进步，通过为富裕客户提供税收损失收获和单独管理账户（SMA）等服务来吸引他们。然而，它仍然面临着来自高盛资产管理和摩根士丹利参数平台等成熟参与者的激烈竞争。对个性化、税收高效投资组合的需求在财富管理者中继续增长，使SMA成为资产管理行业增长的一个关键领域。

 **JPMorgan Chase** has successfully attracted over $15 billion from wealthy clients to its tax strategy business, aiming to capture more market share from competitors such as **Goldman Sachs Asset Management** and **Morgan Stanley's Parametric platform**. The bank is focusing on offering services like tax-loss harvesting through separately managed accounts (SMAs), which allow investors to lower their tax bills while expressing specific preferences, such as favoring environmental, social, and governance factors.

In the past two years, JPMorgan has intensified its efforts in this area by selling stocks at a loss for clients' portfolios, resulting in significant growth of SMA assets. According to Cerulli Associates, assets in SMAs rose almost 30% from $1.7 trillion in 2022 to $2.2 trillion in 2023. Tax-loss harvesting has become a standard practice among asset managers as investors seek tax advantages amid market fluctuations and strong returns.

Despite JPMorgan's growth, it still trails behind **Goldman Sachs Asset Management** with approximately $280 billion in tax-aware strategies and **Morgan Stanley's Parametric platform** as the leader in direct indexing. Other players like BlackRock, Vanguard, Invesco, and Allspring Global Investments have also made significant moves to capitalize on the growing demand for personalized, tax-efficient portfolios through SMAs.

In conclusion, JPMorgan Chase is making strides in its tax strategy business by attracting wealthy clients with services like tax-loss harvesting and separately managed accounts (SMAs). However, it still faces stiff competition from established players such as Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Morgan Stanley's Parametric platform. The demand for personalized, tax-efficient portfolcuoles continues to grow among wealth managers, making SMAs a key area of growth in the asset management industry.
