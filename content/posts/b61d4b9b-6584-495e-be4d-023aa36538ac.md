# **英国私立学校推出预付款计划，提前应对工党可能的税改** 

**英国私立学校**正在向家长推广**预付款计划**，似乎是提前应对**工党**在赢得下一届大选后可能提出的税改。这些计划允许家长**提前支付多年的学费**，并可获得一小笔折扣。此举很可能是为了应对工党提出的取消私立学校**增值税豁免**的计划，该计划将使私立学校的成本**上涨 20%**。一些较小的学校已经推出了此类计划或大力宣传，而一些较著名的学校则较为谨慎，认识到可能面临未来的税收负担。**英国税务海关总署**可能会对这些计划提出质疑，因为它们可能并不属于真正的预付款，而且还可能出现**追溯性立法**，2019 年的**贷款收费**就是一例。税务专家警告说可能存在风险，包括意外的增值税收费，并呼吁工党明确其税收计划。私立学校的代表则辩护称这些计划是合法的，并表示它们一直被用于各种目的，包括财务遗产规划。

# Private schools bolster advance payment schemes ahead of Labour tax changes 

**Private schools** in the UK are promoting **advance payment schemes** to parents, seemingly in anticipation of potential tax changes proposed by the Labour Party, should they win the next election. The schemes allow parents to pay fees for multiple years upfront, with a small discount. This move is likely in response to Labour's plan to **end the VAT exemption** for private schools, effectively increasing costs by 20%. While some smaller schools have introduced or prominently advertised these schemes, more established schools have been cautious, recognizing the possibility of future tax charges. **HMRC** could challenge these schemes, as they may not truly constitute advance payments, and there is also the potential for **retroactive legislation**, as seen with the 2019 **loan charge**. Tax experts warn of potential risks, including unexpected VAT charges, and call for clarity from Labour on their tax plans. Representatives from private schools defend the schemes as legitimate and state that they have been used for various reasons, including financial legacy planning.
