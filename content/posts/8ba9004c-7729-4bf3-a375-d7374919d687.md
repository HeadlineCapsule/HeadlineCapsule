# 非洲煮食炉计划获**22 亿美元**投资，资金来源包括石油和天然气集团 

**国际能源署**（**IEA**）已从各国**政府、石油和天然气公司**以及**碳信用计划**等各方获得**22 亿美元**的资金承诺，用于改善非洲的煮食方法。该计划旨在解决室内燃烧木柴和垃圾所造成的健康问题，据估计，此类行为每年导致**全球 370 万人过早死亡**，其中大部分是**妇女和儿童**。国际能源署执行董事法提赫·比罗尔强调，转向更清洁的煮食方法不仅对能源重要，对**性别、健康和气候**也至关重要。

尽管来自挪威、荷兰和美国等国的公共部门资金约占优惠资金的 30%，但石油和天然气巨头（如道达尔能源公司和荷兰皇家壳牌公司）的参与引发了争议。将**碳信用**作为融资机制的方式受到质疑，因为人们担心所声称的**二氧化碳减排量**是否准确。约有 15% 或更多的资金依赖于这些信用额，意大利的埃尼公司和维托尔公司等企业通过此方式参与其中。

国际能源署估计，要确保非洲家庭在 2030 年之前采用清洁煮食方法，每年需要 40 亿美元的投资，而这仅占 2023 年全球能源投资额 2.8 万亿美元的一小部分。尽管存在挑战，国际能源署和非洲国家仍在通力合作，制定路线图以有效利用承诺资金并解决这一紧迫问题。

# $2.2bn Africa cooking stove plan includes funds from oil and gas groups 

**The International Energy Agency** **(IEA)** has secured a $2.2bn pledge from various sources, including **governments, oil and gas companies**, and **carbon credit schemes**, to improve **cooking methods** in Africa. This initiative aims to address the health issues caused by the **indoor burning of wood and debris**, which contributes to an estimated **3.7 million premature deaths globally each year**, predominantly among **women and children**. The IEA's executive director, Fatih Birol, emphasizes that transitioning to cleaner cooking methods is essential not just for energy but also for **gender, health, and climate**. 

While public sector funds from countries like Norway, the Netherlands, and the US contribute about 30% of the concessional funding, the involvement of major oil and gas companies, such as TotalEnergies and Shell, has sparked debate. The use of **carbon credits** as a funding mechanism has come under scrutiny due to concerns over the accuracy of claimed **CO₂ savings**. Approximately 15% or more of the funding relies on these credits, with companies like Italy's Eni and Vitol participating through this method. 

The IEA estimates that an annual investment of $4 billion is required to ensure African households have access to clean cooking methods by 2030, a fraction of the $2.8 trillion invested in energy globally in 2023. Despite the challenges, the IEA and African countries are collaborating to create a roadmap to utilize the pledged funds effectively and address this pressing issue.
