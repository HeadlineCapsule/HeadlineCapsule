美国5月非农就业人数增加27.2万，远超预期

**文章摘要：**
美国劳动力市场5月新增**272,000**个就业岗位，超出预期。这一显著增长导致人们重新评估美联储可能何时实施加息。数据超过了经济学家的预测，可能会影响总统乔·拜登在11月美国总统大选前的经济论述。

**失业率：**尽管就业增长强劲，但失业率从3.9%略微上升到4%。这一上升趋势可能会引起美联储的关注，并影响他们未来几个月对利率的决定。

**市场反应：**在发布这些数据后，市场对美联储在9月中旬会议加息的预期从81%下降到**57%**。此外，预计到11月的加息时间也推迟到了12月。

**工资通胀和国债收益率：**5月平均每小时工资同比增长4.1%，远高于美联储2%的通货膨胀目标。这导致两年期国债收益率急剧上升，从3.71%上升到**4.88%**，并使美元对欧元走强。

**美联储立场：**尽管工资单数字强劲，但美联储仍谨慎降低借贷成本。一些经济学家预测，首次加息可能发生在9月，并在9月、11月和12月共下调0.75个百分点。

**与欧洲中央银行的比较：**与美联储谨慎的方法形成对比，欧洲中央银行最近实施了近五年来的首次加息。

总之，虽然美国劳动力市场继续显示出强劲的就业增长，但工资通胀和失业率存在混合信号，这可能会影响美联储未来的货币政策决定。即将到来的6月会议预计将维持当前利率，但后续会议可能会根据不断变化的经济指标进行调整。

 **Summary of Article:**  
The US labor market exceeded expectations by adding amo...
- [response]: **272,000 jobs** in May. This significant increase has led to a reassessment of when the Federal Reserve might implement interest rate cuts. The data surpassed economists' predictions and may influence President Joe Biden's economic narrative ahead of the November US presidential election.

- **Unemployment Rate**: Despite strong job growth, the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4% from 3.9%. This uptick could potentially draw attention from the Federal Reserve and impact their decision on interest rates in the coming months.

- **Market Reaction**: Following the release of this data, market expectations for a Fed rate cut at the mid-September meeting decreased from 81% to amo...
- [response]: **57%. Additionally, anticipated interest rate cuts by November were pushed back to December.**

- **Wage Inflation and Treasury Bond Yields**: Average hourly pay increased by 4.1% year over year in May, which is significantly above the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2%. This has led to a surge in two-year Treasury yields, rising by 0.17 percentage points to 4.88%, and strengthened the dollar against the euro.

- **Federal Reserve Stance**: The Federal Reserve remains cautious about lowering borrowing costs despite strong payroll figures. Some economists predict that the first rate cut may occur in September, with a total reduction of 0.75 percentage points spread across September, November, and December.

- **Comparison to European Central Bank**: In contrast to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, the European Central Bank recently implemented its first interest rate cut in nearly five years.

In conclusion, while the US labor market continues to show robust job growth, there are mixed signals regarding wage inflation and unemployment rates that may influence future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. The upcoming June meeting is expected to maintain current interest rates, but subsequent meetings could see adjustments based on evolving economic indicators.
