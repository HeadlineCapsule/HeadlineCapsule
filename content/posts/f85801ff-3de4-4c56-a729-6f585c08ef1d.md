对冲基金亿万富翁比尔·阿克曼可能支持唐纳德·特朗普

**摘要：**
对冲基金亿万富翁比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）可能会在美国大选中支持唐纳德·特朗普，因为华尔街正在向这位前总统示好。尽管之前向民主党人捐赠资金，包括向迪恩·菲利普斯（Dean Phillips）捐赠，并支持像罗伯特·F·肯尼迪 Jr.这样的替代候选人，但阿克曼对拜登的厌恶超过了他对特朗普的 ambivalence。另一位华尔街亿万富翁斯蒂芬·施瓦茨曼（Stephen Schwarzman）也宣布支持特朗普，称这是“变革的投票”。华尔街的支持不断增长，同时批评拜登政府监管过度和反垄断议程。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：影响比尔·阿克曼考虑支持唐纳德·特朗普参加美国大选的因素有哪些？
   答案：主要因素是他对乔·拜登总统的厌恶，这超过了他对特朗普可能存在的 ambivalence。此外，华尔街的一些人物和亿万富翁，如斯蒂芬·施瓦茨曼，也表示支持特朗普，将其视为“变革的投票”。阿克曼之前向民主党人和替代候选人的捐赠似乎在此刻并不是他决策过程中的重要因素。

2. 问题：华尔街的支持不断增长如何影响了其他亿万富翁捐赠者，如肯·格里芬（Ken Griffin）和米丽암·阿德尔森（Miriam Adelson）？
   答案：华尔街对特朗普的支持不断增长，可能会促使一些亿万富翁捐赠者重新考虑他们的立场，或者根据势头做出决定。例如，肯·格里芬尚未承诺支持，但提到他可能会根据拟议提名人的 running mate 做出决定。米丽암·阿德尔森正在将大量资源投入支持特朗普的超级政治行动委员会“维护美国”。

3. 问题：华尔街投资者可能面临哪些挑战，如果他们想公开支持唐纳德·特朗普？
   答案：一些领先的华尔街投资者发现公开支持特朗普在社会上很尴尬或有风险，因为他的争议声誉和正在进行的法律问题，例如与Stormy Daniels的付款有关的纽约审判。此外，一些人可能担心朋友、同事或客户的报复，如果他们公开支持特朗普，可能会抵制其投资组合公司出售的产品和服务。

**建议：**

1. 监控华尔街对唐纳德·特朗普的支持动态，因为它可能会影响其他亿万富翁捐赠者并可能影响选举结果。
2. 关注阿克曼立场或公开声明的任何潜在转变，鉴于他在对冲基金行业的巨大财务资源和影响力。
3. 关注与纽约特朗普审判相关的法律进展，因为它们可能会影响华尔街投资者公开支持

**Summary:**
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman is likely to back Donald Trump in the US election, as Wall Street warms up to the former president. Despite previously donating money to Democrats, including Dean Phillips, and supporting alternative candidates like Robert F Kennedy Jr., Ackman's dislike for Biden outweighs his ambivalence towards Trump. Stephen Schwarzman, another billionaire from Wall Street, has also announced support for Trump as a "vote for change." The growing support on Wall Street comes amidst criticism of the Biden administration's regulatory overreach and antitrust agenda.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: What factors are influencing Bill Ackman to consider backing Donald Trump in the US election? 
A: The primary factor is his dislike for President Joe Biden, which outweighs any ambivalence he may have towards Trump. Additionally, some Wall Street figures and billionaires like Stephen Schwarzman are also showing support for Trump as a "vote for change." Ackman's previous donations to Democrats and alternative candidates do not seem to be significant factors in his decision-making process at this point.
2. Q: How is the growing support from Wall Street influencing other billionaire donors, such as Ken Griffin and Miriam Adelson? 
A: The increasing support for Trump on Wall Street may influence some billionaire donors to reconsider their stance or make a decision based on the momentum. For example, Ken Griffin has not yet committed his support but mentioned that he might do so depending on the presumptve nominee's pick for a running mate. Miriam Adelson is directing significant resources towards the pro-Trump super-political action committee known as Preserve America.
3. Q: What are some of the challenges faced by Wall Street investors who may want to publicly endorse Donald Trump? 
A: Some leading Wall Street investors find it socially awkward or risky to openly support Trump due to his controversial reputation and ongoing legal issues, such as a trial in New York related to payments made to Stormy Daniels. Additionally, some may fear backlash from friends, colleagues, or customers who might boycott the services and products sold by their portfolio companies if they were to publicly endorse Trump.

**Recommendations:**
1. Monitor further developments in Wall Street's support for Donald Trump as it may influence other billionaire donors and potentially impact the election outcome.
2. Pay attention to any potential shifts in Ackman's stance or public statements, given his significant financial resources and influence within the hedge fund industry.
3. Keep an eye on legal developments related to Trump's trial in New York, as they may affect Wall Street investors' willingness to openly endorse him.
