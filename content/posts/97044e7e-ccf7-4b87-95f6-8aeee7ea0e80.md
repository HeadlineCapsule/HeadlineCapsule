# 美国企业发现借贷条件改善，市场反弹

随着 **芝加哥联储全国金融状况指数** 显示企业的 **借贷条件** 改善，美国企业发现 **金融环境** 越来越有利。尽管美联储维持高利率，但该指数创下了 2022 年 1 月以来的最低水平，该指数衡量企业借贷的便利程度。这种改善归因于股价飙升和借贷溢价下降，这增加了企业的资本获取渠道。股市反弹是由最新通胀数据显示的美联储降息预期推动的。此外，公司债券与美国国债收益率之间的利差处于多年来的低位，进一步增强了企业借贷的吸引力。然而，一些投资者警告称，由于美国经济表现出韧性，以及维持紧缩的金融环境以遏制通胀的需要，美联储可能不会降息。

# US companies find borrowing conditions improving as markets rally

**US financial conditions** are becoming more favorable for businesses as the **Chicago Fed's National Financial Conditions Index** indicates improved **borrowing conditions** for companies. The index, which measures the ease of corporate borrowing, has reached its lowest level since January 2022, despite the Federal Reserve maintaining high-interest rates. This improvement is attributed to surging **share prices** and declining **borrowing premiums**, which have increased access to capital for companies. The equity market rally has been fueled by expectations of the Fed cutting rates, as indicated by the latest inflation data. Additionally, corporate bond spreads over US Treasury yields are at multiyear lows, further enhancing the attractiveness of borrowing for businesses. However, some investors caution that the Fed may not cut rates due to the resilience of the US economy and the need to maintain tight financial conditions to curb inflation.
