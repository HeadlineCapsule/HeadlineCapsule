亨特·拜登（Hunter Biden）的毒品滥用问题成为关注焦点，因为检察官开启了枪支审判

# 文章摘要

这篇文章讨论了亨特·拜登（Hunter Biden）的毒品滥用问题，以及他涉嫌在吸毒成瘾期间购买枪支而受到的联邦审判。这个案件是由美国总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）的司法部提起的，重点关注亨特在购买枪支时背景调查期间是否撒谎隐瞒了毒品使用情况。

## 要点：
- 联邦律师将在针对亨特·拜登的审判中提出照片和信息等证据。
- 此案围绕着亨特在等待新智能手机时购买枪支展开，同时存在他是否在背景调查期间使用毒品的问题。
- 检察官声称亨特在联邦表格上故意撒谎，而他的律师则辩称他在撒谎时并没有在吸毒。
- 审判可能会定义什么构成成瘾，并可能分散人们对拜登总统连任竞选活动的注意力。
- 亨特的毒品滥用始于他哥哥博（Beau）的去世，导致他与博的妻子哈莉（Hallie）的关系破裂。
- 审判与唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）最近因伪造商业记录而被定罪有关，该记录涉及“封口费”付款。
- 亨特·拜登并不是因为毒品使用而受审，而是因为在购买枪支时撒谎隐瞒了毒品使用情况。
- 检察官计划提出亨特的自传《美丽事物》（Beautiful Things）中的证据，以及照片和短信等不雅内容作为案件的一部分。

The article discusses Hunter Biden's drug abuse and the federal trial surrounding his purchase of a firearm while allegedly being addicted to drugs.

**Key Points:**

- Prosecutors allege that Hunter knowingly lied on the federal form, whereas his attorneys argue he was not using drugs at the time of the lie.
- The trial is likely to define what constitutes an addict and may distract from President Biden's re-election campaign efforts.
- Hunter's drug abuse followed the death of his older brother, Beau, leading to a doomed romantic relationship with Beau's widow, Hallie.
- The trial is linked to Donald Trump's recent conviction for falsifying business records related to "hush money" payments.
- Hunter Biden was not on trial for drug use but for lying about it during the firearm purchase.
- Prosecutors plan to present evidence from Hunter's 2e addiction memoir, Beautiful Things, and lurid photos and text messages as part of their case.
