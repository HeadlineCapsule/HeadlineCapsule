美国通货膨胀会继续缓解吗？

**新闻摘要**

美联储首选的通胀衡量标准，即个人消费支出指数（PCE），预计将从 4 月的 2.7% 下降到 5 月的 2.6%。这是在本月早些时候公布了令人鼓舞的消费者价格数据之后，表明美国通胀在数月停滞不后可能开始缓解。

尽管美联储预测到 12 月只会降息一次，但投资者仍押注于多次降息。生产者价格增长放缓也让投资者相信 PCE 将保持低位。然而，即使 5 月核心 PCE 数据为 0%，也可能不会为 7 月立即降息创造条件。

在法国，市场在即将举行的议会选举远右翼和极左翼政党可能获得重大收益的前景引发了卖盘后已趋于稳定。法国和德国债券收益率的差距已经缩小，但仍然接近 2014 年以来未见过的水平。

土耳其央行预计将维持其 50% 的高利率，因为政策制定者试图解决该国长期存在的通货膨胀危机，该危机在去年 5 月达到 75%。尽管提高了利率并增加了诸如汽油等商品的税收，但土耳其在 2024 年第一季度的 GDP 仍以 5.7% 的年增长率增长。然而，来自工厂和零售行业的最新数据表明土耳其经济前景正在减弱。

**要点：**
- 美国通胀可能在缓解，因为 PCE 指数预计将在 5 月下降到 2.6%。
- 投资者押注多次降息，尽管美联储预测到 12 月只会降息一次。
- 法国议会选举后市场趋于稳定，但远右翼和极左翼政党可能获得重大收益，导致市场仍具波动性。
- 土耳其央行预计将维持其高利率，以应对该国通货膨胀危机，该危机在去年 5 月达到 75%。

 **Article Summary**

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, known as the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE), is expected to show a decrease from 2.7% in April to 2.6% in May. This follows encouraging consumer price figures earlier this month and suggests that US inflation may be easing after months of stagnation.

Investors are betting on multiple interest rate cuts, despite the Fed's forecast for a single cut by December. A slowdown in producer price growth has also given investors confidence that PCE will remain low. However, even if May's core-PCE print comes in at 0%, it may not create a path for an immediate July rate cut.

In France, markets have steadied after the prospect of significant gains by far-right and hard left parties in upcoming snap parliamentary elections sparked a sell-off. The gap between French and German bond yields has eased but remains close to levels not seen since 201

Turkey's central bank is expected to maintain its elevated interest rate of 50% as policymakers seek to address the country's long-running inflation crisis, which reached 75% last month. Despite higher rates and tax increases on goods like petrol, Turkey's GDP grew at a 5.7% annual rate in Q1 2024. However, recent data from the factory and retail sectors indicate a weakening outlook for the Turkish economy.

**Key Points:**
- US inflation may be easing as PCE index is expected to decrease to 2.6% in May.
- Investors are betting on multiple interest rate cuts, despite Fed's forecast of a single cut by December.
- French markets have steadied after snap parliamentary elections but remain volatile due to potential gains by far-right and hard left parties.
- Turkey's central bank is expected to maintain its elevated interest rate as it seeks to address the country's inflation crisis, which reached eby last month.
