奢侈运动品牌Golden Goose推迟米兰上市计划

# 奢侈运动品牌金鸡推迟上市计划

**新闻摘要：** 英国私募股权公司珀米拉（Permira）旗下的奢侈运动品牌金鸡（Golden Goose）以其破旧外观的运动鞋而闻名，受到泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift）等名人的青睐。该公司原定于在米兰上市，这将是今年欧洲最引人注目的首次公开募股（IPO）之一。

**要点：

1. 推迟的原因是市场状况：**该公司称，“在欧洲议会选举之后以及法国大选的召开之后，市场状况显著恶化”，因此决定推迟其 IPO 计划。

2. 对投资者行为的担忧：**有人担心，在 IPO 期间购买股票的投资者一旦开始交易，可能会迅速出售股票，从而导致潜在的波动性。

3. 市场资本化和筹资目标：**金鸡原本希望通过 IPO 筹集约 6 亿欧元资金，市场估值近 20 亿欧元。

4. 首席执行官对推迟上市的看法：**首席执行官西尔维奥·坎帕拉（Silvio Campara）表示，“IPO 不是一个一次性的交易”，并相信尽管市场动荡，但潜在投资者仍会支持该公司。

5. 奢侈品行业放缓：**全球奢侈品行业今年面临着放缓的局面，但金鸡在今年的第一财季报告了 12% 的收入增长。

6. 对珀米拉之前 IPO 努力的影响：**这次推迟上市是珀米拉面临的另一个挫折，该公司在三年前伦敦上市英国靴品牌 Dr Martens，自 IPO 以来，该公司的股价一直下跌。

 **Article Summary:** Luxury sports brand Golden Goose, owned by British private equity group Permira and famous for its distressed-looking trainers popular among celebrities such as Taylor Swift, has postponed plans for an imminent listing in Milan that would have been one of the most high-profile initial public offerings (IPOs) in Europe this year.

**Key Points:
1. Postponement due to market conditions:** The company cited "significant deterioration in market conditions following European parliament elections and calling of a general election in France" as the reason for postponing its IPO plans.
2. Concerns over investor behavior:** There were fears that investors buying at the IPO would quickly sell once trading in shares started, leading to potential volatility.
3. Market capitalization and fundraising goals:** Golden Goose had been seeking to raise roughly €6n0mn at a market capitalisation of nearly €2bn through its IPO.
4. CEO's perspective on the postponement:** Chief executive Silvio Campara stated that "the IPO is not a one-shot deal" and expressed confidence in prospective investors supporting the company despite market turbulence.
5. Luxury sector slowdown:** The global luxury sector has been facing a slowdown this year, but Golden Goose reported a 12% rise in revenue in the first quarter of the year.
6. Impact on Permira's previous IPO efforts:** This postponement is another setback for Permira, which previously floated British boot brand Dr Martens in London three years ago and has seen its shares plunge since the IPO.
