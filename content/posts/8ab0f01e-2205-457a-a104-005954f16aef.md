# **欧洲央行**在美联储之前降息有风险

**欧洲中央银行（欧洲央行）**在**美国联邦储备委员会（美联储）**之前启动**降息周期**的潜在决定存在经济风险，特别是在**增长**和**通货膨胀**方面。尽管**欧洲央行行长克里斯蒂娜·拉加德**暗示了提前降息的可能性，但这一举动可能产生不可预见的后果。

首先，**欧元贬值**可能会增加**进口通胀**，考虑到欧元区对能源进口的依赖，这可能会进一步推高能源价格，影响企业投资。其次，在欧洲央行行美联储之前降息可能向市场发出欧洲央行预期经济表现不佳的信号，这可能会打击家庭和企业的投资信心。最后，如果欧洲央行的行动被视为操之过急，其信誉可能会进一步受损，其信誉本来就低于美联储。

欧洲央行偏离了美联储“更高更长”的政策方针，这不寻常，并有可能适得其反。更好的策略可能是专注于财政措施，例如利用**欧盟下一代疫情后复苏计划**项下的欧洲专项资金来提振经济，而无需降息可能带来的潜在负面影响。此外，**投资税收抵免**可以解决资本生产率低的问题。归根结底，尽管欧洲央行对欧元区疲弱的 GDP 增长和通货紧缩有合理的担忧，但改变央行降息的传统“轮流降息”顺序可能产生重大经济影响。

# A premature ECB rate cut before the Fed has risks

**The European Central Bank's (ECB)** potential decision to initiate a **rate-cutting cycle** before the **US Federal Reserve** (Fed) presents economic risks, particularly regarding **growth** and **inflation**. While ECB president **Christine Lagarde** has signaled the possibility of an early rate cut, this move could have unintended consequences. 

/n/n

Firstly, a **depreciation of the euro** is likely to increase **imported inflation**, especially given the Eurozone's reliance on energy imports, which could further raise energy prices and impact business investment. Secondly, a rate cut before the Fed could signal to markets that the ECB expects poor economic performance, potentially discouraging household and corporate investment. Finally, the ECB's credibility, already lower than that of the Fed, could be further diminished if its actions are perceived as premature. 

/n/n

The ECB's divergence from the Fed's "higher-for-longer" policy approach is unusual and carries the risk of backfiring. A better strategy may be to focus on fiscal measures, such as utilizing the European funds earmarked under the **Next Generation EU post-pandemic recovery programmes**, to boost the economy without the potential drawbacks of a rate cut. Additionally, a **tax credit for investment** could address low capital productivity. Ultimately, while the ECB has valid concerns about weak Eurozone GDP growth and disinflation, altering the traditional "batting order" of central banks in rate-cutting could have significant economic repercussions.
