维克多·欧尔班阻挠用冻结的俄罗斯资产向乌克兰提供武器资金。

## 摘要：
**维克多·欧尔班**的匈牙利正在阻挠欧盟立法，该立法将允许欧盟从被制裁冻结的俄罗斯资产中为乌克兰提供高达 **20 亿欧元** 的武器。尽管欧盟已同意利用滞留在比利时中央证券存管处 Euroclear 中的约 **1900 亿欧元** 的利润，但匈牙利特使反对在未获得所有 **27个成员国** 一致支持的情况下快速跟进付款。布达佩斯原则上并未反对这一想法，但担心自动付款，希望其资金份额不会被用于购买提供给乌克兰的武器。

## 有趣的问题：
**Q1:** 如果匈牙利继续阻挠有关利用冻结的俄罗斯资产的立法，可能会有什么影响?
**A1**: 如果匈牙利坚持阻挠这一立法，可能会推迟或阻止欧盟向乌克兰提供急需的武器和财政支持。这可能会削弱乌克兰对俄罗斯的立场，并使匈牙利与欧盟其他成员国之间的关系紧张。此外，它可能会妨碍七国集团国家根据未来冻结的俄罗斯资产产生的利润发放贷款的努力。

**Q2:** 布达佩斯过去如何回应来自欧盟和华盛顿的外交压力?
**A2**: 在匈牙利反对有关乌克兰的欧洲决定的情况下，例如向基辅提供 **500 亿欧元** 的援助计划，布达佩斯在外交压力的影响下最终让步。这表明，如果面临欧盟和美国官员足够的外交努力，匈牙利有可能重新考虑其目前关于利用冻结的俄罗斯资产的立场。

**Q3:** 欧盟、七国集团国家和匈牙利之间可能达成哪些潜在解决方案或妥协?
**A3**: 可能的解决方案包括解决布达佩斯对自动付款的担忧，同时仍允许使用被冻结的俄罗斯资产。这可能涉及建立保障措施以防范潜在风险，或者规定具体的条件来确保匈牙利的份额不会被用于为乌克兰购买武器。此外，外交努力可以侧重于在欧盟 **27** 国之间建立共识，以尽量减少匈牙利单方面阻碍立法的能力。

## Summary:
Viktor Orbán's Hungary is obstructing legislation that would allow the European Union (EU) to provide up to €2 billion in weapons for Ukraine from frozen Russian assets under sanctions. The EU had agreed to use profits arising from about €190bn stuck in Belgian central securities depository Euroclear, but Hungary's envoy objected to fast-tracking payments without unanimous backing from all 27 EU countries. Budapest has not opposed the idea in principle but is concerned about automatic payments and wants its share of funds not used for purchasing weapons for Ukraine.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What are the potential implications if Hungary continues to block the legislation on using frozen Russian assets?
A1: If Hungary persists in blocking this legislation, it could delay or even prevent the EU from providing much-needed weapons and financial support to Ukraine. This may weaken Ukraine's position against Russia and strain relations between Hungary and other EU member states. Additionally, it might hinder efforts by G7 countries to issue a loan based on future profits arising from Russian assets.

Q2: How has Budapest responded to diplomatic pressure from the EU and Washington in previous instances of objections?
A2: In past situations where Hungary objected to European decisions related to Ukraine, such as the €50 billion aid package for Kyiv, Budapest eventually relented under diplomatic pressure. This suggests that there is a possibility for Hungary to reconsider its current stance on using frozen Russian assets if faced with sufficient diplomatic efforts from EU and US officials.

Q3: What are some potential solutions or compromises that could be reached between the EU, G7 countries, and Hungary regarding this issue?
A3: Possible solutions may include finding a way to address Budapest's concerns about automatic payments while still allowing for the use of frozen Russian assets. This might involve creating safeguards against potential risks or enscribing specific conditions that would ensure Hungary's share is not used for purchasing weapons for Ukraine. Additionally, diplomatic efforts could focus on building consensus among EU27 countries to minimize Hungary's ability to block the legislation unilaterally.
