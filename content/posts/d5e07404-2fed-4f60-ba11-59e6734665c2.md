# 伊朗表示愿意与联合国进行“认真对话”，联合国核监管机构负责人称

**国际原子能机构**(**IAEA**)总干事**拉斐尔·格罗西**表示，伊朗已表示愿意与联合国核监管机构进行“认真对话”，这是一年多以来的首次。在伊朗与该机构关系紧张、伊朗**核计划**受到制裁的背景下，这一进展尤为重要。格罗西此番言论是在他最近访问伊朗，与**伊朗核计划负责人穆罕默德·伊斯拉米**和其他高级官员会谈后发表的。

有迹象表明，德黑兰正寻求缓和美伊关系，并解决争议问题，包括改善国际原子能机构监督该国核活动的力度。这种态度转变与今年早些时候美国和伊朗高级官员在阿曼举行的秘密间接会谈不谋而合，旨在防止以色列-哈马斯冲突升级。

尽管伊朗已经将铀浓缩到了**60%的纯度**，接近**武器级水平**，但格罗西指出，没有证据表明伊朗在发展核武器。然而，他强调了伊朗核计划的扩张及其力量。目前，国际原子能机构正在与伊朗官员进行技术谈判，以期进入核设施，解决长期以来的问题。

鉴于伊朗过去曾推翻与该机构达成的协议，尤其是在美国退出2015年核协议后，这些讨论的结果仍不确定。尽管如此，格罗西仍专注于确保持续接触，并对伊朗核计划保持有意义的了解。

# Iran open to ‘serious dialogue’, says UN nuclear chief

**Rafael Grossi**, director-general of the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**, has stated that Iran has expressed a willingness to engage in "serious dialogue" with the UN's nuclear watchdog for the first time in over a year. This development comes amidst **fraught relations** between Tehran and the agency over Iran's **nuclear program**, which has led to **sanctions** being imposed on the country. Grossi's comments follow his recent talks in Iran, where he met with **Iranian nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami** and other senior officials. 

There are signs that Tehran is seeking to de-escalate tensions with the US and resolve points of contention, including improving the IAEA's ability to monitor the country's nuclear activities. This shift in tone coincides with secret indirect talks between senior US and Iranian officials in Oman earlier this year, aiming to prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from escalating. 

While Iran has been enriching uranium up to **60% purity**, close to **weapons-grade levels**, Grossi noted that there is "no evidence" of a move towards a weapons program. However, he emphasized the Iranian nuclear program's growth and strength. The IAEA is currently in technical talks with Iranian officials, aiming to gain access to nuclear facilities and resolve long-standing issues. 

The outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, given Iran's history of reneging on agreements with the agency, particularly since the US pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord. Nonetheless, Grossi is focused on ensuring continued engagement and meaningful levels of visibility into Iran's nuclear program.
