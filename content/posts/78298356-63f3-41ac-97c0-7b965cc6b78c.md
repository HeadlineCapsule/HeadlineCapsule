野村证券向英国银行家支付创纪录的1200万美元奖金

# 野村证券向英国银行家授予创纪录的 1.2 亿美元薪酬

日本野村证券集团向其批发银行业务部门负责人克里斯托弗·威尔科克斯（Christopher Willcox）颁发了创纪录的薪酬。在公司度过动荡期后，他发挥了重要作用。在截至 3 月的一年里，威尔科克斯赚了 1200 万美元，是野村证券首席执行官奥田健太郎（Kentaro Okuda）同期收入的三倍多。

# 野村证券批发银行业务部门推动利润增长

向克里斯托弗·威尔科克斯颁发薪酬，是在野村证券实现利润增长的一年之后，主要得益于其批发业务。该部门包括交易、投资银行和国际财富管理。今年前三个月股票交易的蓬勃发展极大地促进了这一成功，日本股票达到 20 年来最高水平。

# 野村证券财务业绩改善

由于恢复良好，野村证券在最近一个财政年度报告净利润为 1.66 万亿日元（10.4 亿美元），比上一期增长 9300 亿日元。该公司股价今年上涨了超过 45%。

# 日本高管薪酬披露要求

在日本，公司必须披露获得超过 1 亿日元薪酬的高管薪酬。虽然威尔科克斯的薪酬是野村证券的纪录，但有人指出，该公司非执行银行家以前曾获得比他更高的薪酬。

# 与其它银行高管的比较

克里斯托弗·威尔科克斯的绩效薪酬使他与一些欧洲银行首席执行官处于同一水平，但仍落后于许多顶级美国银行家。在同期，野村证券首席执行官奥田健太郎获得 5.06 亿日元（320 万美元）。由于日元走弱，日本高管薪酬以美元计算比以前的时期要少。

# 克里斯托弗·威尔科克斯背景和野村证券角色

威尔科克斯 56 岁，在 2021 年加入野村证券之前，职业生涯包括在摩根大通银行（JPMorgan Chase & Co.）工作超过 13 年，并晋升到领导该银行资产管理业务的职位。他还在花旗集团（Citigroup）工作过，然后成为野村证券批发部门负责人，这是奥田首席执行官试图在发生动荡期后复兴银行的一部分，包括阿奇戈斯资本（Archegos Capital）倒闭后的大额交易损失以及全球金融格局面临的其他挑战。

 **Nomura awards British Banker Record $12 Million Pay Package**  

The Japanese group, Nomura, has awarded a record pay package to Christopher Willcox, the leader of its wholesale banking division. This award comes after his role in helping the company recover from one of its most turbulent periods. In the year ending March, Willcox earned $12 million, more than triple the amount made by Nomura's chief executive Kentaro Okuda during the same period.

**Nomura's Wholesale Banking Division Drives Profit Growth**  

The pay award to Christopher Willcox follows a year in which Nomura returned to profit growth, driven primarily by its wholesale business. This division includes trading, investment banking, and international wealth management. A surge in stock trading during the first three months of the year contributed significantly to this success, with Japanese stocks reaching their highest levels since the 1amo period.

**Nomura's Financial Performance Improves**  

As a result of its recovery, Nomura reported net income of ¥166 billion ($1.04 billion) in its most recent financial year, up from ¥93 billion in the prior period. The company's share price has also increased by more than 45% this year.

**Executive Pay Disclosure Requirements in Japan**  

In Japan, companies are required to disclose the pay of executive officers who receive over ¥100 million in remuneration. While Willcox's pay award is a record for Nomura, it has been noted that non-executive bankers at the company have previously received higher sums than what he was awarded.

**Comparison to Other Banking Executives**  

Christopher Willcox's performance-based pay places him in the same league as some European banking chief executives, although still trailing many top US bankers. Nomura's CEO Kentaro Okuda received ¥506 million ($3.2 million) during the same period. The weakening of the yen has resulted in Japanese executive pay being smaller in dollar terms compared to previous periods.

**Christopher Willcox's Background and Role at Nomura**  

Willcox, 56 years old, joined Nomura in 2nineteen-twenty-one after a career that included more than thirteen years at JPMorgan Chase & Co., where he rose through the ranks to lead the bank's asset management business. He also worked at Citigroup before becoming head of the wholesale division at Nomura, which was part of CEO Okuda's push to revive the bank after a period of turmoil that included significant trading losses following the collapse of Archegos Capital and other challenges in the global financial landscape.

**Nomura's Strategic Focus on Stable Business Growth**  

Under CEO Okuda, Nomura has sought to reduce its reliance on volatile trading revenues and increase those from more stable businesses such as wealth management. The company is also targeting cost cuts in the wholesale banking division as part of an effort to improve return on equity.

**Pay Determination at Nomura**  

According to a filing by Nomura, pay at the company is determined by considering roles and responsibebilities, domestic and international regulations, and standards.
