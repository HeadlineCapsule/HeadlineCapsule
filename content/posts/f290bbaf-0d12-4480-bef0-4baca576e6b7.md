埃尔多安解雇土耳其央行行长的权力被裁定为违宪

# 土耳其宪法法院裁定限制总统解雇央行行长的权力

**摘要：** 土耳其宪法法院裁定限制总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安（Recep Tayyip Erdoğan）解雇央行行长的权力。这一裁决是针对主要反对党提出的诉讼做出的，该诉讼称这种总统权力需要立法支持。这一决定可能会缓解外国投资者的担忧，他们对埃尔多安干预央行的事宜保持警惕。

**要点：**
- 土耳其宪法法院驳回了总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安（Recep Tayyip Erdoğan）的一项法令，该法令允许他解雇央行行长。
- 这一裁决是针对主要反对党于2018年提出的诉讼做出的回应。
- 这一决定可能会消除外国投资者的担忧，他们对埃尔多安干预央行的事宜保持警惕。
- 自去年以来，埃尔多安一直承诺实施“合理政策”来应对土耳其75%的年度通货膨胀率（截至5月）。
- 银行最近的变化发生在2月，当时土耳其第一位女央行行长哈菲泽·盖伊·埃尔坎（Hafize Gaye Erkan）在任职8个月后被埃尔多安解雇。
- 埃尔多安总统在星期二内阁会议后的讲话中没有提及这一裁决。他的顾问穆罕默德·乌库姆（Mehmet Uçum）后来表示，取消该法令不是因为规则的“实质”，而是因为它的授权方式。
- 一些分析人士怀疑宪法法院会冒着与埃尔多安再次对抗的风险，因为法院独立采取行动的条件仍然不明确。

 **Summary:** 
Turkey's constitutional court ruled against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan'cu authority to dismiss central bank governors. The ruling came after the main opposition party filed a lawsuit, stating such presidential power required legislation. This decision may ease concerns of foreign investors who were wary of Erdoğan's interventions at the central bank.

**Key Points:**
- Turkey's constitutional court struck down part of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan'cu decree, which allowed him to fire central bank governors.
- The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the main opposition party in 2018.
- This decision may address concerns of foreign investors who were wary of Erdoğan's interventions at the central bank.
- Since last year, Erdoğan has promised "rational policies" to fight Turkish inflation, which stands at an annual 75% in May.
- The most recent change at the bank was in February when Hafize Gaye Erkan, the first female governor of Turkey's central bank, was dismissed by Erdoğan after eight months in the job.
- President Erdoğan did not mention the ruling in a speech after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. His adviser Mehmet Uçum later said that the annulment was not about "the substance" of the rule but how it was mandated.
- Some analysts doubted the constitutional court would risk another confrontation with Erdoğan, as conditions for independent action by courts are still not apparent.
