# 北马其顿民族主义者有望在选举中卷土重来

**北马其顿**的政治格局预计将发生转变，因为选民很可能在周三举行的**议会和总统选举**中，将**民族主义政党内部马其顿革命组织-马其顿民族统一民主党（VMRO）重新推上执政地位**。这一变化可能会**影响该国加入欧盟的努力**，而这一努力已经面临来自邻国的阻碍。

随着民调显示右翼反对党有望胜出，VMRO党有望在 2017 年因**腐败指控**下台后重新获得影响力。该党领袖**赫里斯蒂扬·米科夫斯基**对他们的胜利充满信心。与此同时，由**迪米塔尔·科瓦切夫斯基**领导的执政党社会民主党，则敦促选民选择“通往欧洲的最后机会”。

VMRO 党有望重新执政，引发了人们对该国与欧盟入盟谈判的担忧。VMRO 党持有**民族主义主张**，拒绝了邻国欧盟成员国保加利亚提出的要求，即北马其顿在宪法中提及保加利亚历史，而北马其顿则声称拥有单独的**民族身份**，尽管在语言上相似。即将离任的政府已同意欧盟解决这一争端的计划，但保加利亚继续阻挠入盟谈判。

VMRO 党在**尼古拉·格鲁埃夫斯基**领导下的上一届政府于 2017 年因窃听丑闻下台，格鲁埃夫斯基本人被判入狱，但目前流亡海外。专家们怀疑该党的新的领导层是否会推动与欧盟谈判取得进展。如果 VMRO 党在议会中未能获得多数席位，他们可能需要与阿尔巴尼亚族政党组成执政联盟，因为后者在该国政治中拥有重要影响力。

# North Macedonia’s nationalists set for electoral comeback 

**North Macedonia** is expected to witness a **shift in political landscape** as voters are likely to bring the **nationalist VMRO party back to power** in the **parliamentary and presidential elections** held on Wednesday. This change may **impact the country's EU membership bid**, which has already faced obstacles from neighboring countries.

With polls projecting a win for the right-wing opposition, the VMRO party is set to regain influence after being voted out in 2017 amid **corruption allegations**. The party's leader, **Hristijan Mickovski**, has expressed confidence in their victory. Meanwhile, the incumbent Social Democrats, led by **Dimitar Kovačevski**, urged voters to choose the "last call for Europe."

The potential return of VMRO to power raises concerns about the country's EU membership talks. VMRO has a **nationalist agenda** and has rejected demands from neighboring EU member Bulgaria to include references to Bulgarian history in North Macedonia's constitution, citing a separate **national identity** despite linguistic similarities. The outgoing government had agreed to an EU plan to resolve this dispute, but Bulgaria continues to block accession talks.

The VMRO's previous rule under **Nikola Gruevski** ended in 2017 due to a wiretapping scandal, and he was sentenced to prison in absentia. Experts doubt that the party's new leadership will foster progress on EU talks. If VMRO falls short of a majority in parliament, they may need to form a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties, which have a significant influence on the country's politics.
