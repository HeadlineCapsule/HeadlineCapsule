# 星巴克需要加快服务速度，而不是推出更加复杂的饮品

**同店销售额下降**，股价也受到影响，价值几乎**下跌了 20%**。新任**首席执行官 Laxman Narasimhan**将这些问题归咎于星巴克的最大市场——美国和中国的**长时间等待**和**价格敏感型消费者**。

**Narasimhan的解决方案**是通过为咖啡师提供更好的设备来更有效地处理复杂的饮品订单，从而**加快服务速度**。此外，星巴克计划推出新的**受珍珠奶茶启发的饮品**和食品，以吸引周末顾客，并开拓深夜和通宵需求。

然而，这一策略可能会适得其反，因为它可能会进一步**减慢服务速度**，特别是考虑到已经非常广泛的菜单，其中有超过**170,000 种饮品定制选项**。**改良饮品**占净饮料销售额的 85%，通常价格更高，准备起来很费时，导致咖啡师沮丧，进而**推动工会成立**。

改善星巴克业绩的关键可能在于**简化菜单**，专注于早上赶时间的核心客户群，他们占美国销售额的**一半**。这些忠实客户中有很大一部分由于等待时间过长和菜单缺货而放弃了手机 APP 订单。随着消费者变得越来越谨慎，以及达能甜甜圈、独立咖啡店等强劲竞争对手的出现，留住这些回头客对于星巴克的成功至关重要。

# Starbucks Needs Faster Service, Not More Complicated Drinks 

**Same-store sales are falling**, and the stock price has taken a hit, with a nearly 20% drop in value. The new **CEO, Laxman Narasimhan**, attributes these issues to long wait times and price-conscious consumers in Starbucks's largest markets: the US and China. 

**Narasimhan's solution** is to speed up service by providing baristas with better equipment to handle complex drink orders more efficiently. Additionally, Starbucks intends to introduce new **boba-inspired drinks** and food items to attract weekend customers and tap into late-night and overnight demand. 

However, this strategy may backfire as it could further slow down service, especially given the already extensive menu with over **170,000 drink customization options**. **Modified drinks**, which account for 85% of net beverage sales, often come with higher prices and can be time-consuming to prepare, leading to frustration among baristas and contributing to **unionization efforts**. 

The key to improving Starbucks's performance may lie in **simplifying its menu** and focusing on its core morning rush hour customers, who make up half of its US sales. A significant percentage of these dedicated customers are abandoning their mobile app orders due to long wait times and unavailable menu items. With consumers becoming more cautious with their spending and the presence of strong competitors like Dunkin' Donuts and independent coffee shops, retaining these repeat customers is vital for Starbucks's success.
