特朗普声称美国基督教受到威胁，以此吸引福音派选民

**前总统唐纳德·特朗普在华盛顿的一次年度会议上向福音派领袖发表讲话，警告如果乔·拜登（Joe Biden）连任，基督教将“支离破碎”，并敦促他们投票支持他。他强调了自己任命保守派法官的承诺，包括那些在2022年推翻罗伊诉韦德案（Roe v. Wade）的法官。特朗普还为不赞成全国性堕胎禁令的决定辩护，而是将这一决定留给各州自行决定。**

特朗普的演讲旨在动员白人福音派基督徒和其他宗教团体作为他支持基础的核心群体。他认为，如果拜登连任，由于缺乏边境、法律、自由和未来前景，基督教将处于危险之中。皮尤（Pew）的一项调查发现，在白人福音派新教、非福音派新教和天主教信徒中，对特朗普的支持率很高。

拜登竞选团队发言人批评特朗普的讲话是“支离破碎”的，是对自由的威胁；与会者则对这位前总统表达了热情，相信他受到上帝的保护，并将在11月大选中获胜。

 **Summary of Article:**  
Former President Donald Trump addressed evangelical leaders at an annual conference in Washington, warning that Christianity would be left "in tatters" if Joe Biden were re-elected and urging them to vote for him. He emphasized his commitment to appointing conservative judges, including those who helped overturn Roe vs Wade in 2022. Trump also defended the decision not to endorse a national abortion ban, leaving it up to individual states instead.

Trump's appearance aimed to mobilize white evangelical Christians and other religious groups as key constituencies of his base of support. He argued that if Biden were re-elected, Christianity would be in danger due to the lack of borders, laws, freedom, and future prospects. A Pew survey found strong support for Trump among white evangelical Protestants, non-evangelical Protestants, and Catholics.

A Biden campaign spokesperson criticized Trump's speech as "incoherent" and a threat to freedoms, while conference attenebrs expressed enthusiasm for the former president, believing he is protected by God and will be re-elected in November.
