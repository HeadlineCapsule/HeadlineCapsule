可持续发展挂钩债券因信誉问题受挫

## 摘要：
可持续发展挂钩债券（SLBs）的发行量下降了5个百分点，而绿色债券市场仍然强劲，今年头四个月全球稳定发行2320亿美元。SLBs 将公司的债务利息支付与其气候承诺挂钩，但由于缺乏积极的改进和延迟触发更高利息罚款日期，其可信度受到质疑。另一方面，绿色债券一直很受欢迎，发行率稳定，并得到国际资本市场协会（ICMA）于 2013 年制定的《绿色债券原则》等自愿准则的支持。

## 问题：

1. 可持续发展挂钩债券（SLB）发行量下降的原因是什么？
   - SLBs的可信度受到质疑，例如缺乏积极的改进和延迟触发更高利息罚款日期，导致其发行量下降5%。此外，由于共和党与石油和天然气公司关系友好，美国政治也阻碍了ESG标签债券的增长。

2. 绿色债券与可持续发展挂钩债券（SLBs）有何不同？
   - 绿色债券用于为环保项目提供资金，而SLBs将公司的债务利息支付与其气候承诺挂钩。由于缺乏积极的改进和延迟触发更高利息罚款日期，SLBs的可信度受到质疑。

3. 哪些自愿准则支持绿色债券的增长？
   - 国际资本市场协会（ICMA）于2013年制定的《绿色债券原则》是自愿准则，帮助绿色债券市场发展到今天的水平。这些原则为发行人和投资者提供了一个框架，以确保绿色债券收益透明和诚信。

4. 美国政治如何影响ESG标签债券？
   - 2020年乔·拜登总统赢得白宫后，与石油和天然气公司关系友好的共和党加紧了他们对环境、社会和治理（ESG）投资的攻击。这种批评动摇了固定收益领域，导致ESG标签债券美元量下降。

5. 可持续债务领域最近有哪些创新？
   - 2021年2月，日本发行了第一只“过渡性债券”，用于资助不一定是绿色但应该会降低污染经济部门整体排放的投资。这只107亿美元的过渡性债券禁止将任何资金用于天然气发电，标志着过渡性金融的一个重要里程碑。

## Summary:
Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) have seen a 5cu% decrease in issuance, while green bond market remains robust with steady global issuance of $232bn in the first four months of this year. SLBs tie company's debt interest payments to its climate promises but face credibility concerns due to lack of aggressive improvements and late trigger dates for higher interest penalties. Green bonds, on the other hand, have remained popular with stable issuance rates and are supported by voluntary guidelines like the Green Bond Principles established by ICMA in 2013.

## Questions:

1) What factors contributed to the decrease in sustainability-linked bond (SLB) issuances?
    - The credibility concerns surrounding SLBs, such as lack of aggressive improvements and late trigger dates for higher interest penalties, have led to a 5% decrease in their issuance. Additionally, US politics has played a role in hindering ESG-labelled bonds' growth due to criticism from Republicans friendly with oil-and-gas companies.

2) How do green bonds differ from sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs)?
    - Green bonds are used to finance environmentally friendly projects, while SLBs tie a company's debt interest payments to its climate promises. The credibility of SLBs has been questioned due to the lack of aggressive improvements and late trigger dates for higher interest penalties.

3) What voluntary guidelines support the growth of green bonds?
    - The Green Bond Principles, established by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) in 2013, are voluntary guidelines that have helped the green bond market grow to where it is today. These principles provide a framework for issuers and investors to ensure transparency and integrity in the use of proceeds from green bonds.

4) How has US politics affected ESG-labelled bonds?
    - After President Joe Biden won the White House in 2020, Republicans friendly with oil-and-gas companies ramped up their attacks on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. This criticism has rocked the fixed-income space, leading to a decrease in US dollar volumes for ESG-labelled bonds.

5) What recent innovations have been made in sustainable debt?
    - Japan issued its first "transition bond" in February 2021, which funds investments that are not necessarily green but should result in lower emissions from polluting economic sectors overall. This $10.7bn transition bond forbids any proceeds being put towards gas-fired power generation and marks a significant milestone in transition finance.
