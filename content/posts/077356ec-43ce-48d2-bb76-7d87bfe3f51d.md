## 七国集团支持“特朗普防范计划”以援助乌克兰

**华盛顿的七国集团盟友** 越来越支持美国的提议，即在俄罗斯继续入侵之际，向**乌克兰**提供数十亿美元的**提前资金**。该计划将于**6 月峰会**讨论，包括由未来**冻结的俄罗斯资产**支持的**七国集团对乌克兰的贷款**。该提议旨在解决人们对潜在的**唐纳德·特朗普总统**任期的担忧，特朗普可能停止对乌克兰的援助。由于西方军事援助的延迟，乌克兰军队面临严峻形势，因此这一资金至关重要。该计划最早可能在**夏季**产生 500 亿美元，七国集团成员认识到确保长期支持的重要性。该计划得到了七国集团成员越来越多的共识，法国、德国、意大利和日本都对该计划表示了开放态度。然而，仍有待敲定的细节包括贷款的结构和担保。预计七国集团领导人将于下月做出决定，美国推动在联合声明中加入提及利用俄罗斯国有资产收益的措辞。欧盟已同意将部分收益用于购买提供给乌克兰的武器，但七国集团利用收益的任何计划都将需要欧盟单独做出一致决定，但这可能因存在异议的成员国而推迟。

# G7 warms to plan for Trump-Proofing Ukraine Aid 

**Washington's G7 allies** are increasingly supportive of a **US proposal** to provide **tens of billions of dollars** in **upfront funding** to **Ukraine**, as Russia continues its invasion. The plan, to be discussed at a **June summit**, involves a **G7 loan** to Ukraine, backed by future profits from **frozen Russian assets**. This proposal aims to address concerns about a potential **Donald Trump presidency**, which could halt US aid to Ukraine. The funding is crucial as Ukrainian forces face a challenging situation due to delayed western military aid. The plan could generate **$50 billion** as early as **summer**, with G7 members recognizing the need to ensure long-term support. There is growing consensus among G7 members, with France, Germany, Italy, and Japan showing openness to the idea. However, details remain to be finalized, including the structure and guarantees of the loan. The decision is expected to be made by G7 leaders next month, with the US pushing for language referring to leveraging Russian state asset proceeds in the joint statement. The EU has agreed to use a portion of the profits to buy weapons for Ukraine, but any G7 plan leveraging profits would require a separate unanimous EU decision, which could face delays due to dissenting members.
