# **银湖** 筹集创纪录资金用于“更大笔的投资” 

**银湖（Silver Lake）**，一家知名的专注于科技领域的私募股权公司，为其第七只私募股权基金筹集了 205 亿美元，超过了其 2021 年前身基金筹集的金额。在私募股权公司面临挑战的时期，这一成就显得尤为突出。由于近来轻松赚钱的时代结束，导致估值下降和交易停滞，私募股权公司举步维艰。银湖的成功归因于其洞察市场的能力，吸取过去的教训，例如在 2020 年至 2022 年期间对科技公司的一系列小型被动投资，被称为“懊悔区”，并重新专注于更大、更复杂的交易。该公司联席主管 **Egon Durban** 和 **Greg Mondre** 承认了更大笔投资更高的回报，并承诺进行大规模投资。伴随着这一战略转变的是自 2023 年初以来总计 200 亿美元的资产出售，产生了巨额意外收益，包括以 80 亿美元向 **Broadcom** 出售其在 **VMware** 中的股份。随着科技行业估值下跌，银湖抓住机会进行了多项大型收购，例如美国软件集团 **Qualtrics**、德国科技先驱 **Software AG** 和体育及人才经纪公司 **Endeavor** 的私有化，七笔交易的平均股权投资为 35 亿美元。该公司支持者赞赏这一调整及其进行大规模高信誉投资的意愿。 

与此同时，**FTX** 账户持有者即将获得优惠赔付，因为债务人宣布了一项计划，将向几乎所有账户持有者赔付每美元 1.18 美元，持有 5 万美元以下账户的人将获得现金赔付及其利息。考虑到第 11 章破产案中无担保债权人的性质，这一消息令人意外。这主要得益于 **FTX** 投资组合的货币化，包括其所持有的 **Anthropic** 股份。同时，**德意志银行的 DWS** 因夸大其资产管理规模和年度流动量而受到审查，夸大的手段包括将咨询性授权（经理提供建议但不会监督投资）计入其中。这一会计操作手法提升了高管奖金和公司资产负债表表现，但却引发了适当披露的担忧，导致前 CEO **阿索卡·沃赫曼（Asoka Wöhrmann）**于去年年底辞职。DWS 坚称其定义和报告与同行做法保持一致，尽管批评人士认为将咨询性资产的价值变化计入流动量中是不常见的，也不符合行业惯例。

# Silver Lake raises record fund for ‘bigger bets’ 

**Silver Lake**, a prominent technology-focused private equity firm, has raised $20.5 billion for its seventh private equity fund, surpassing the amount raised by its predecessor fund in 2021. This achievement stands out amidst a challenging period for private equity firms, which have faced difficulties due to a recent era of easy money coming to an end, resulting in reduced valuations and stalled deal-making. Silver Lake's success is attributed to its ability to navigate the market by learning from past mistakes, such as a series of small passive investments in tech companies between 2020 and 2022, dubbed the "regret zone," and refocusing on larger, more complex deals. The firm's co-heads, **Egon Durban** and **Greg Mondre**, have acknowledged the higher returns associated with bigger bets and have committed to investing at scale. This strategy shift is accompanied by a series of asset sales, totaling $20 billion since early 2023, that have generated significant windfalls, including the $8 billion sale of their interest in **VMware** to **Broadcom**. With technology valuations falling, Silver Lake has seized the opportunity to pursue large takeovers, such as taking private US software group **Qualtrics**, German technology pioneer **Software AG**, and sports and talent agency **Endeavor**, with an average equity investment of $3.5 billion across seven deals. The firm's backers applaud this adjustment and their willingness to make large, high-conviction bets.

In other news, **FTX** account holders are set to receive a favorable payout as the debtor announced a plan to pay nearly all account holders 118 cents on the dollar, with those holding accounts under $50,000 receiving their entire claim in cash plus interest. This comes as a surprise given the nature of unsecured creditors in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The recovery is largely due to the monetization of FTX's investment portfolio, including a stake in **Anthropic**. Meanwhile, **Deutsche Bank's DWS** has come under scrutiny for inflating its assets under management and annual flows by including advisory mandates, where the manager gives advice but doesn't oversee investments. This accounting maneuver boosted executive bonuses and the firm's balance sheet but has raised concerns over proper disclosure, with former CEO **Asoka Wöhrmann** stepping down late last year. DWS maintains that its definitions and reporting are consistent and in line with peer practice, despite critics arguing that including changes in the value of advisory assets in flows is uncommon and inconsistent with industry practice.
