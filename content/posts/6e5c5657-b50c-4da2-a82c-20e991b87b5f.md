# 美国公司债券市场在借贷溢价下降的推动下迎来一波交易热潮

**企业**本周纷纷涌向规模达10万亿美元的**美国公司债券市场**，一波交易热潮筹集了数千亿美元。这场热潮是由**投资者强烈的需求**和**低借贷溢价**推动的，导致了一波新的债务发行。

**低评级或高收益公司**在超过20笔交易中发行了超过140亿美元的债券，这是2021年底以来的最高水平。与此同时，**投资级借款人**在45笔交易中出售了567亿美元，是自2月下旬以来最大的每周美元金额。这次热潮是由市场越来越确信**美国利率**今年不太可能大幅下降，以及**11月份美国选举**对市场的潜在影响所推动的。

美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）最近的言论和疲弱的就业市场数据所影响的有吸引力的定价环境，进一步推动了这一活动。**公司借款人**支付的信用利差（高于**美国国债**）接近20年来的最低水平，大型投资者推动借贷成本下降。

本周值得注意的交易包括医疗集团Organon的10亿美元债券销售和支付公司Block发行的20亿美元债券。在**投资级市场**，药店巨头CVS发行了50亿美元债券，可口可乐和意大利能源公司埃尼（Eni）也筹集了大量资金。

然而，市场参与者预测未来几个月发行速度将放缓，这表明热潮可能是提前执行的借款计划。尽管如此，较低评级的债券仍然活跃，发行人正在利用有利的机会窗口。强烈的投资者需求压缩了利差，降低了相对国债的借贷成本。

美国高收益债券的平均利差周一接近其2007年的低点，而投资级债券的平均利差收紧至2021年以来的最低水平，接近2005年以来的最窄水平。利差收紧反映出市场基本面强劲，对美联储管理通胀的能力越来越有信心，不会破坏经济大局。

总的来说，美国公司债券市场经历了一周的疯狂活动，企业争相利用有利的条件，投资者将借贷成本推至接近历史低点。

# Rush of deals hits US corporate bond market as borrowing premiums fall

**Businesses** have flocked to the $10tn **US corporate bond market** this week, with a surge of deals raising tens of billions of dollars. This rush has been driven by **feverish investor demand** and **low borrowing premiums**, resulting in a wave of new debt issuances. 

**Junk-rated or high-yield companies** have issued over $14bn in bonds across more than 20 deals, the highest since late 2021. Meanwhile, **investment-grade borrowers** have sold $56.7bn across 45 deals, the largest weekly dollar amount since late February. This rush is prompted by the market's growing conviction that **US interest rates** are unlikely to fall steeply this year, and the potential impact of the **November US election** on markets. 

The attractive pricing environment, influenced by Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell's recent comments and weaker jobs market data, has further fueled this activity. Credit spreads, the premiums **corporate borrowers** pay over **US Treasury bonds**, have approached two-decade lows, with big investors driving down borrowing costs. 

Notable deals this week include healthcare group Organon's $1bn bond sale and Block, the payments company, issuing $2bn worth of bonds. In the **investment-grade market**, pharmacy giant CVS offered a $5bn bond, while Coca-Cola and Italian energy company Eni also raised significant funds. 

However, market participants predict a slowdown in the pace of issuance in the coming months, suggesting that this rush may be a pull forward of borrowing plans. Despite this, the lower-grade front remains active, with issuers taking advantage of favorable windows of opportunity. The intense investor demand has compressed spreads, reducing borrowing costs relative to Treasuries. 

The average US high-yield spread neared its 2007 low on Monday, while the average investment-grade spread tightened to its lowest since 2021, just shy of the narrowest point since 2005. This spread narrowing reflects strong market fundamentals and growing confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability to manage inflation without derailing the economic picture. 

/n/n

Overall, the US corporate bond market has experienced a frenzied week of activity, with businesses rushing to take advantage of favorable conditions and investors driving down borrowing costs to near-historic lows.
