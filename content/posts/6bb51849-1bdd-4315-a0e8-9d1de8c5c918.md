黑石集团以5.8亿英镑收购维斯特里公司，强势进入英国租赁住房市场

**黑石公司 5.8 亿英镑投资英国租赁住房**

私募股权集团黑石与房屋开发商维斯特里达成协议，通过购买约 1750 套新房进入英国租赁住房市场。这是黑石及其少数合作伙伴雷吉斯在八个月内的第二次重大投资，总金额达 14 亿英镑，涉及超过 4500 套房屋。这一举动反映了机构投资者越来越多地寻求在英国租赁市场中缺乏服务的机会。

该交易包括为 Leaf Living 和 Sage 提供资金，这两家由黑石支持的公司在私营租赁部门专注于提供高质量的住房库存。这些房屋的收购是解决英国优质租赁住宿供应不足的更广泛战略的一部分。

尽管围绕机构投资者及其对租金水平的影响存在怀疑，但黑石坚持认为其参与由于在整体住房库存中的相对较小份额，不会显着影响市场动态。该公司旨在继续扩大其在欧洲的投资组合，同时解决租赁部门中关于租户待遇和负担能力的问题。

英国私营租赁房屋的租金创纪录地上涨，这归因于新冠疫情限制放松后需求增加以及房东的利息成本上升等因素。保守党政府因其在这些挑战中所采取的保护租户措施而受到批评。

参与该交易的房屋开发商维斯特里已将其重点转向与公共部门实体和非营利组织合作建造经济适用房。这一战略旨在在影响其他英国房屋开发商的市场低迷期创造充满活力的新型社区。

总之，黑石通过与维斯特里的协议向英国租赁住房市场投资 5.8 亿英镑，表明机构投资者越来越有兴趣解决该国租赁部门服务不足的问题，并为租户提供高质量的住宿。

 **Blackstone's £580mn Investment in UK Rental Housing**

Private equity group Blackstone has reached a deal with housebuilder Vistry, acquiring approximately amo
United Kingdom rental housing market through the purchase of about 1,750 new homes. This transaction marks the second significant investment by Blackstone and its minority partner Regis in eight months, totaling £1.4bn for over 4,500 homes. The move reflects a growing trend among institutional investors seeking opportunities within the UK's underserved rental market.

The deal involves funding new-build properties managed by Leaf Living and Sage, two companies backed by Blackstone focused on providing high-quality housing stock in the private rented sector. The acquisition of these homes is part of a broader strategy to address the UK's undersupply of quality rental accommodation.

Despite skepticism surrounding institutional investors and their impact on rent levels, Blackstone maintains that its involvement does not significantly affect market dynamics due to its relatively small share in the overall housing stock. The company aims to continue expanding its portfolio across Europe while addressing concerns about tenant treatment and affordability within the rental sector.

The UK's private rental homes have experienced record rent increases, attributed to factors such as increased demand following Covid-19 restrictions and rising interest costs for landlords. The Conservative government has faced criticism over its handling of tenants' protections amidst these challenges.

Vistry, the housebuilder involved in this deal, has shifted its focus towards partnerships to build affordable housing on behalf of public sector entities and non-profit organizations. This strategy aims to create vibrant new communities while navigating market downturns that have impacted other UK housebuilders.

In summary, Blackstone's £580mn investment in the UK rental housing market through its deal with Vistry demonstrates an increasing interest among institutional investors in addressing the country's underserved rental sector and providing high-quality accommodation for tenants.
