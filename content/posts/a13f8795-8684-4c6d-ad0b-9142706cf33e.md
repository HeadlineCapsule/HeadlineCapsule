美联储官员暗示在2024年之前只降息一次

**美联储官员信号2024年之前仅降息一次，同时保持对通货膨胀的强硬立场。**

**关键要点：**

1. 美联储官员信号在2024年之前仅**降息一次**，采取强硬的通货膨胀立场，同时将借贷成本维持在23年来的高位。

2. 美联储的新预测显示，中位数设定者预计今年仅降息一次，这与交易员预期的两次降息相反，标志着从以前的预测中发生了显著变化。

3. 美国总统乔·拜登面临挑战，因为在年底之前仅降息一次的前景与其专注于经济和努力控制通货膨胀的连任论点不一致。

4. 尽管5月的消费者价格指数数据低于预期，但美联储主席杰伊·鲍威尔将其描述为“令人鼓舞”，并淡化了对更高通胀预测的担忧。

5. 在周三央行宣布后，对9月降息的预期从80%以上下降到约64%。

6. 美联储关于利率的最新信号也伴随着新的增长预测，预计美国经济在2024年将增长2.1%，同时标普通货膨胀预期略有上升。

7. 根据联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）的预测，失业率预计今年将保持在4%。

 **Summary:**  
US Federal Reserve officials signal just one interest rate cut before end of 2024 amidst a hawkish stance on inflation. The Fed held rates at a 23-year high, with the median rate-setter anticipating only one quarter-point cut this year. This is contrary to traders' expectations for two cuts and marks a significant change from previous forecasts.

**Key Points:**  
1. US Federal Reserve officials signal just **one interest rate cut before end of 2024**, taking a hawkish stance on inflation as they held borrowing costs at a 23-year high.
2. The Fed's new predictions show the median rate-setter anticipating only one quarter-point cut this year, contrary to traders' expectations for two cuts and marking a significant change from previous forecasts.
3. President Joe Biden faces a blow as the prospect of just one cut before the end of the year does not align with his re-election pitch focused on the economy and efforts to beat back inflation.
4. Despite cooler-than-expected consumer price index data for May, Fed chair Jay Powell described it as "encouraging" and downplayed concerns about higher inflation forecasts.
5. Expectations of a rate cut in September fell from above 80% to around 64% after the central bank's announcement on Wednesday.
6. The Fed's latest signal on interest rates also came alongside new growth forecasts, with the US economy expected to expand by eby 2.1 per cent in 2024 and inflation expectations rising slightly for both headline and core PCE measures.
7. Unemployment is projected to remain at 4% by the end of the year according to the FOMC forecast.
