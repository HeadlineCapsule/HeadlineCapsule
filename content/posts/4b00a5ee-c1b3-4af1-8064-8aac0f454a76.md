# 唐纳德·特朗普在关键的2024年摇摆州领先乔·拜登 

**乔·拜登**目前在2024年美国总统选举的民意调查中落后于**唐纳德·特朗普**，特别是在一些关键的摇摆州。最近《**纽约时报**_/锡耶纳调查》显示，特朗普在大多数摇摆州领先于可能的和已注册的选民，拜登只在密歇根州和威斯康星州领先。这让民主党人担心拜登的连任前景，一位**民主党战略家** Jim Manley表达了对竞选活动影响不大的失望。民意调查还显示，拜登在年轻选民和有色人种中的支持率正在下降，这些人群曾是他2020年胜选的关键。特朗普在经济和**以巴冲突**等议题上领先拜登，而拜登在堕胎议题上领先。**[FiveThirtyEight]** 网站的全国民调平均数据显示，两位候选人之间差距不大，特朗普领先0.9个百分点。不过，拜登的竞选民意测验专家Geoff Garin提醒不要仅根据一次调查就得出广泛结论，他表示许多选民尚未完全关注这次选举。

# Donald Trump leads Joe Biden across crucial 2024 swing states 

**Joe Biden** currently trails **Donald Trump** in polling for the 2024 US presidential election, particularly in crucial swing states. A recent **New York Times/Siena survey** shows Trump leading among probable and registered voters in most swing states, with Biden only ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin. This has raised concerns among Democrats about Biden's re-election prospects, with a **Democratic strategist**, Jim Manley, expressing frustration at the campaign's lack of impact. The poll also revealed Biden's eroding support among young voters and people of color, who were key to his 2020 victory. Trump held advantages over Biden on issues like the economy and the **Israeli-Palestinian conflict**, while Biden led on abortion. The **FiveThirtyEight national polling average** indicates a narrow gap between the candidates, with Trump leading by 0.9 percentage points. Biden's campaign pollster, Geoff Garin, however, cautioned against drawing broad conclusions from a single survey, stating that many voters are yet to fully engage with the election.
