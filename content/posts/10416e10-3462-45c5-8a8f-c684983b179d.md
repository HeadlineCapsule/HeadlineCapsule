# 斯嘉丽·约翰逊抨击OpenAI聊天机器人声音复制其本人

**斯嘉丽·约翰逊**，一位著名的好莱坞演员，对**OpenAI**在其最新的人工智能产品中使用一个类似她本人的声音表达了愤怒。约翰逊在声明中透露，** OpenAI **的首席执行官**萨姆·阿尔特曼**曾经邀请她为公司旗舰级的** ChatGPT 工具 **配音，但遭到她的拒绝。上周发布的ChatGPT更新版引入了一个人工智能的声音，观察人士指出该声音与约翰逊在电影《Her》中的演绎惊人相似。这引发了人们对快速发展的人工智能领域道德界限和同意问题的担忧。虽然OpenAI否认故意仿声，但在受到审查后暂停使用了其中一个名为“Sky”的AI语音。这一事件让人们关注到人工智能创新与潜在侵犯个人身份和创作之间的模糊界线。

# Scarlett Johansson hits out at OpenAI over chatbot voice 

**Scarlett Johansson**, a prominent Hollywood actor, has expressed outrage at **OpenAI's** use of a voice resembling hers in its latest AI product. In her statement, Johansson revealed that **Sam Altman**, CEO of OpenAI, had previously approached her to voice the company's flagship **ChatGPT tool**. However, she declined the offer. The updated version of ChatGPT, released last week, features an AI voice that observers noted was strikingly similar to Johansson's portrayal in the film *Her*. This has led to concerns about ethical boundaries and consent in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. While OpenAI denied deliberate mimicry, they have paused the use of "Sky," one of their AI voices, amid scrutiny. The incident has brought attention to the blurred lines between AI innovation and potential infringement on individual identities and creative works.
