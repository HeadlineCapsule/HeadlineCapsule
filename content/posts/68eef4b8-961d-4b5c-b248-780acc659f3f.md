# 德意志银行的DWS虚增客户资产流入数十亿欧元

**德意志银行的资产管理部门** DWS 最近陷入争议，因为被揭露其虚增了**数十亿欧元**的资产管理规模。这**是通过包括** **咨询授权**达成的，这是一种**低利润**的业务，其中资产管理者提供建议但不会做出投资决策。

问题的关键在于，DWS 直到 2022 年底才披露这一做法，而且仅在脚注中提及。这种缺乏透明度的做法引发了人们对 DWS 财务报告准确性及其对高管**奖金计算**潜在影响的质疑。近年来，DWS 的咨询资产增长速度不成比例，了解内情的人将其归因于该公司**薪酬政策**中的激励措施。高管和员工的奖金与**净流入量**挂钩，从而强调了获得新的咨询授权的重要性。

DWS 的薪酬政策设定了将净流入量在资产管理规模中所占百分比每年增加 3 到 5 个百分点的目标。2021 年，DWS 管理层实现了这一目标的 150%，引发了人们对咨询资产在其业绩中所起作用的质疑。尽管 DWS 声称咨询资产的流入并未对高管薪酬产生显著影响，但该公司仍受到分析师和监管机构的密切关注。

这并非 DWS 第一次因其披露做法受到质疑。2023 年，该公司因**绿色清洗**向美国证券交易委员会支付了罚款，法兰克福检察官也正在进行调查。DWS 最近的披露揭示了咨询资产在其总流入量中所占的较大比例，2023 年咨询授权占总资产的 3.5%，但占净流入量的 27%。

《金融时报》的计算进一步显示，从 2018 年 6 月到 2024 年 3 月，咨询资产至少占 DWS 非现金流入量的五分之一。在此期间，咨询资产增加了两倍多，而排除现金后的总资产管理规模增长幅度较小。将咨询资产包括在 DWS 报告的净流量中有着重大影响，2023 年重新发布的データ显示，在剔除咨询授权后，出现了大量流出。

尽管 DWS 声称其内部定义一致，但分析师和业内专家并不认同，他们强调了在净流量中包括咨询资产价值变化的做法并不常见。随着争议的展开，DWS 坚称其财务披露一直准确，而最近在披露方面的变化旨在提高透明度。

# Deutsche Bank’s DWS inflated client asset inflows by billions of euros

**Deutsche Bank's asset management arm**, DWS, has been embroiled in controversy after it was revealed that they inflated their assets under management by billions of euros. This was achieved through the inclusion of **advisory mandates**, a **low-margin business** where the asset manager provides advice but does not make investment decisions. 

/n/n

The issue lies in the fact that DWS did not **disclose** this practice until late 2022, and even then, it was only referenced in a footnote. This lack of transparency has raised questions about the accuracy of DWS's financial reporting and the potential impact on executive **bonus calculations**. The growth of DWS's advisory assets has been disproportionate in recent years, and people familiar with the matter attribute this to the incentives in the company's **pay policy**. Bonuses for executives and staff have been linked to **net inflows**, creating an emphasis on acquiring new advisory mandates. 

/n/n

DWS's pay policy set a target of increasing net inflows as a percentage of assets under management by 3 to 5 percent annually. In 2021, DWS management achieved 150 percent of this target, raising questions about the role of advisory assets in boosting their performance. While DWS has stated that advisory asset inflows have not significantly impacted executive compensation, the company has faced scrutiny from analysts and regulators. 

/n/n

This is not the first time DWS has faced questions about its disclosure practices. In 2023, they paid a fine to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for **greenwashing**, and an investigation by Frankfurt prosecutors is ongoing. The recent disclosures by DWS have brought to light the significant proportion of advisory assets in their overall inflows, with advisory mandates making up 3.5 percent of total assets in 2023, but representing 27 percent of net inflows. 

/n/n

Calculations by the Financial Times further revealed that advisory assets accounted for at least a fifth of all DWS non-cash inflows between June 2018 and March 2024. This period saw advisory assets more than triple, while total assets under management excluding cash rose by a smaller margin. The impact of including advisory assets in DWS's reported net flows was significant, with the restated data for 2023 showing a substantial outflow when stripping out an advisory mandate. 

/n/n

Despite DWS's claims of consistent internal definitions, analysts and industry experts disagree, highlighting the uncommon practice of including changes in the value of advisory assets in net flows. As the controversy unfolds, DWS maintains that their financial disclosure has always been accurate, and recent changes in disclosure aim to provide greater transparency.
