# 拜登将提高太阳能进口关税以保护美国产业

**乔·拜登政府** 宣布计划对双面**太阳能电池板**进口征收**关税**，此举旨在保护国内清洁能源制造业，在即将到来的11月选举前创造就业机会。这一决定取消了对**特朗普时期关税**的豁免，目标直指该国快速增长的清洁能源领域。关税税率定为14.25%，专门针对大型太阳能项目中经常使用的某类电池板单元。此举是美国与北京之间**贸易紧张关系**升级的一部分，近期美国大幅提高了包括电动汽车和太阳能电池在内的中国商品关税。

这一行动的理由是中国产能过剩及其对全球市场的潜在影响所引发的担忧，**阿里·扎伊迪**（Ali Zaidi，拜登的气候顾问）指出了“不公平的非市场行为”的威胁，以及中国太阳能电池板产能过剩压低国际电池板价格的风险。这尤其重要，因为美国从东南亚大量进口廉价的太阳能电池板和电池，导致全球电池板价格下跌。为此，美国还提高了进口电池的免税额度，为依赖这些进口产品的美国开发商提供缓解措施。然而，这一决定引发了美国制造商的褒贬不一的反应，一些人支持取消关税豁免，而另一些人则担心其对业务的影响。

# Joe Biden to raise solar import tariffs in bid to protect US industry

**Joe Biden's administration** has announced plans to impose **tariffs** on double-sided **solar panel** imports, a protectionist move aimed at boosting domestic clean energy manufacturing and creating jobs before the upcoming November election. This decision ends an exemption from **Trump-era tariffs**, targeting a rapidly growing sector of clean energy in the country. The tariff rate is set at 14.25%, and it specifically applies to a type of panel unit often utilized in large-scale solar projects. This action is part of a broader strategy of increasing **trade tensions** with Beijing, with recent sharp hikes in tariffs on Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and solar cells. 

The move is justified by concerns over Chinese overproduction and its potential impact on global markets, with **Ali Zaidi**, Biden's climate adviser, pointing to the threat of "unfair and non-market practices" and the risk of Chinese solar panel overcapacity undercutting international panel manufacturing. This is especially pertinent given the surge in US imports of cheap solar panels and cells from Southeast Asia, which has led to a collapse in global panel prices. To address this, the US is also increasing the amount of imported cells that are exempt from levies, offering relief to domestic developers reliant on these imports. However, this decision has drawn mixed reactions, with some US manufacturers supporting the removal of tariff exemptions, while others express concerns about the impact on their businesses.
