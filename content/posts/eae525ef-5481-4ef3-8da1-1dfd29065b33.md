# **投资信托** 的困境带来了机遇

人们担心，监管上的特殊情况可能会导致**投资信托**解体的情况，尽管**投资信托**历来能够经受住经济危机的考验。问题出在**金融行为监管局 (FCA)** 对两部**欧盟保留法律**《**金融工具市场指令**》（MiFID）和《**包装零售和保险基础产品条例**》（PRIIPs）的解释上，这导致**投资信托** 因成本报告格式而显得比实际更加昂贵。这推动了回归 MiFID 和 PRIIPs 之前成本报告实践的呼声。目前的指标适用于**开放式基金收费**，但不适用于投资信托，在投资信托中，成本会降低投资者所占的**净资产价值**。**投资公司协会 (AIC)** 正游说推动改革，倡导将投资公司从**消费者组合投资 (CCI)** 制度中移除。尽管**上议院委员会**声称误导性的成本阻碍了投资，但对该行业的影响存在争议，因为利率上升和投资者流动等因素也导致了**折价**扩大。尽管面临挑战，**投资信托**在 2021 年仍得到了提振，达到了创纪录的资产规模。机遇在于以折价购买**投资信托**，利用其“自然收入”策略，与开放式基金相比，该策略可以提供更高的收益。

# Investment trusts troubles present an opportunity

There are concerns that a regulatory quirk could be the undoing of **investment trusts**, which have a long history of weathering economic crises. The issue lies in how the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** interprets two pieces of **EU-retained legislation**, **Mifid** and **PRIIPS**, leading to **investment trusts** appearing more expensive than they are due to cost reporting formats. This has led to a push to revert to pre-Mifid and PRIIPS cost reporting practices. The current metrics are suitable for **open-ended fund fees** but not for investment trusts, where costs reduce the **net asset value** an investor has a stake in. The **Association of Investment Companies (AIC)** is lobbying for change, advocating for the removal of investment companies from the **Consumer Composite Investments (CCI)** regime. While the **House of Lords committee** claims that misleading costs are deterring investments, the impact on the sector is debated, with factors like higher interest rates and investor movements also contributing to widening **discounts**. Despite the challenges, investment trusts received a boost in 2021, reaching record assets. The opportunity lies in buying investment trusts at a discount, taking advantage of their "natural income" strategy, which can provide a higher yield compared to open-ended funds.
