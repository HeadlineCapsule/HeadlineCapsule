英国因“预算压力”终止了脱欧后与Palantir的边境协议

**英国因预算压力终止了脱欧后的边境协议**

英国政府已终止了一项价值2700万英镑的软件合同，该合同是美国数据分析公司Palantir的，用于开发脱欧后边境的“流程工具”。这一决定是由于预算压力造成的，而不是对服务不满意。相反，内阁办公室计划开发一种内部模型。

该合同于2020年8月授予，旨在通过了解货物和人员流动的数据来管理脱欧过渡期后的干扰。该软件的三年半期限于3月底到期，未续约。

Palantir在英国市场上面临争议，尤其是人们担心其处理国家健康数据系统。尽管如此，自大流行开始以来，Palantir继续获得价值数亿英镑的政府合同。

该公司在2023年11月为开发新的患者数据平台而获得的3.3亿英镑合同中被使用。人们担心Palantir会利用健康数据谋利，并依赖单一的私营公司来执行关键职能。

Palantir成立于2003年，最初得到CIA的支持，并通过美国情报、军事和警察合同建立业务。英国边境流程合同从Palantir向内阁办公室提供Foundry软件免费试用开始，然后正式授予。

在脱欧后贸易边境建设延迟之际，终止该合同的决定出台，根据英国公共支出监督机构的说法，该边境预计将花费至少47亿英镑。

 **UK Ends Palantir Post-Brexit Border Deal Due To Budget Pressures**

The UK government has terminated a £27 million software contract with US data analytics company, Palantir, for developing a post-Brexit border "flow tool". The decision was made due to budget pressures and not because of dissatisfaction with the service. Instead, the Cabinet Office plans to develop an in-house model.

The contract awarded in 2amoyu August 2020 aimed at managing disruptions following the post-Brexit transition period by gaining insights from data on the movement of goods and people at the border. The software's three-and-a-half-year term expired in late March, without renewal.

Palantir has faced controversy during its foray into the UK market, particularly with concerns raised over handling national health data systems. Despite this, Palantir continues to secure government contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds since the pandemic began.

The company's software was used by NHS England in November 2023 when it awarded a £330 million contract for developing a new patient data platform. Concerns have been raised over Palantir monetizing health data and relying on a single private company for critical functions.

Founded in 2003, Palantir was initially backed by the CIA and has built its business through US intelligence, military, and police contracts. The UK border flow contract began with Palantir providing a free trial of its Foundry software to the Cabinet Office before being awarded officially.

The decision to terminate the contract comes amidst delays in building a post-Brexit trade border, which is expected to cost at least £4.7 billion according to the UK's public spending watchdog.
