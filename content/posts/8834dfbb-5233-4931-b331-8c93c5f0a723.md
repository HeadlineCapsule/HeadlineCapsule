NFL因“周日门票”游戏包被判支付47亿美元反垄断赔偿金

**NFL因“周日门票”游戏包被罚47亿美元**

加利福尼亚州一个陪审团裁定，美国国家橄榄球联盟（NFL）违反反垄断法，必须向购买其卫星电视直播比赛套餐的客户支付47亿美元的赔偿，这是一个里程碑式的案件，可能会重塑体育版权分销市场。

这一裁决来自NFL“周日门票”套餐订阅者提起的联邦集体诉讼，指控该联盟违反反垄断规则，限制某些周日下午比赛的竞争，仅供付费电视播放。该案在洛杉矶联邦法院审理，对体育赛事直播权利捆绑方式可能产生深远影响。

根据美国联邦反垄断法，罚款可能被翻倍，这将对世界上最富有的体育联盟造成重大打击。NFL对裁决表示失望，但坚持认为其媒体分销策略是“无与伦比的粉丝友好型”，并声称指控是毫无根据的。

美国国会通过的1961年《体育广播法案》允许像NFL这样的职业体育联盟免于反垄断法约束，以联合销售媒体广播权利。该法案基于这样一种理念：球队作为单一商业单位内的特许经营队运营，在媒体分销方面不相互竞争。

对联盟之外的比赛需求源于NFL比赛在周日下午同时跨四个时区举行的事实。套餐的价格在每年349美元到449美元之间，具体取决于消费者是否有YouTube TV的分销订阅。

这起诉讼最初由旧金山一家名为Mucky Duck的体育酒吧于2015年提起，此后已扩展到代表数百万人和数万家类似机构。原告强调了NFL 2017年的一份内部备忘录，其中建议该联盟可以将周日比赛分散到有线电视频道，而不是集中到卫星电视上。

与其他美国职业联盟（如大联盟棒球和国家篮球协会）不同，NFL球队不提供单独的电视套餐。在审判证词中，牛仔队老板杰里·琼斯表示，他“完全反对每个团队做电视交易”，尽管他的球队理论上的直接面向消费者的产品据福布斯估算价值90亿美元。

 **NFL Hit with $4.7 Billion Antitrust Verdict Over 'Sunday Ticket' Game Package**

A California jury has found the US National Football League (NFL) guilty of violating antitrust laws and ordered it to pay $4.7 billion in damages to customers who purchased a package of its live games over satellite television, marking a landmark case that could reshape the market for sports rights distribution.

The verdict comes from a federal class-action lawsuit brought by subscribers to the NFL's Sunday Ticket package, alleging that the league restricted competition for certain Sunday afternoon games to pay-TV in violation of antitrust rules. The case was tried in a federal court in Los Angeles and may have wide-reaching consequences on how live sports rights are bundled.

The fines could be tripled under US federal antitrust law, delivering a significant blow to the world's richest sports league. The NFL expressed disappointment with the verdict but maintained that its media distribution strategy is "by far the most fan-friendly" and claimed the allegations were baseless and without merit.

The Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, passed by US Congress, exempts professional sports leagues like the NFL from antitrust laws to pool sales of media broadcast rights. The act is based on the idea that teams operate as franchises within a single business unit and are not in competition with one another for media distribution.

The demand for out-of-network games, sold by the league as its Sunday Ticket package, stems from the fact that most NFL games take place simultaneously across four time zones on Sunday afternoons. The package costs between $349 and $449 per year, depending on whether consumers have a subscription with distributor YouTube TV.

The lawsuit was initially brought by a San Francisco sports bar called the Mucky Duck in 201n5 and has since expanded to represent millions of subscribers and tens of thousands of similar establishments. The plaintiffs highlighted an internal NFL memo from 2017, suggesting that the league could divide Sunday games across cable channels rather than pool them for satellite TV.

Unlike other US professional leagues such as Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, NFL teams do not offer individual TV packages. In his trial testimony, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated he was "completely against each team doing TV deals," despite a theoretical direct-to-consumer offering for his team being estimated to be worth $9 billion by Forbes.
