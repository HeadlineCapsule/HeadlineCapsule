# 欧洲科技领域的监管与创新之争是一种伪命题

欧洲科技领域目前正在进行的**监管**与**创新**之争经常将两者置于对立面。然而，这种观点是误导性的，因为科技创新的成功依赖于多种因素，而监管规则只是其中的一部分。

**布鲁塞尔** 最近将 Booking.com 加入 "**数字市场法 (**[**DMA**]*)* " 下的 "**守门人** " 名单，引发了人们对欧洲培育成功初创企业能力的担忧。**美国科技巨头**游说反对更严格的监管，称其会损害创新。然而，哥伦比亚法学院 **Anu Bradford** 的一篇论文对这一观点提出质疑，强调科技成功的关键因素还包括灵活的移民政策、有利的破产规则和强大的资本市场。

例如，欧洲的风险投资资金比美国少，在后期融资轮中尤其如此。地理因素也发挥了作用，欧盟拥有多种语言和文化的多元化市场，与谷歌等科技巨头早期享有的庞大、同质化的美国市场不同。然而，像 Spotify 这样的例子证明，欧洲公司仍然可以在这些挑战中蓬勃发展。

文章得出结论，虽然监管很重要，但它只是影响欧洲科技创新成功众多因素之一。要真正发挥欧洲的潜力，需要解决从移民和破产政策到资本市场动态及其多元化市场复杂性等一系列问题。

这篇文本分析提供了全面的总结，深入探讨了欧洲科技领域的复杂性，挑战了监管和创新相互排斥这一简单化观念。

# In European Tech, Regulation vs Innovation Is a Spurious Debate

The ongoing **debate** between **regulation** and **innovation** in European tech often pits the two against each other. However, this perspective is misleading, as the success of tech innovation relies on a multitude of factors, with regulatory rules being just one piece of the puzzle. 

**Brussels'** recent addition of Booking.com to the list of "gatekeepers" under the **Digital Markets Act (DMA)** has sparked concerns about Europe's ability to foster successful start-ups. **US tech giants** have lobbied against stricter regulations, citing their negative impact on innovation. However, a paper by **Anu Bradford** of Columbia Law School challenges this notion, highlighting that other factors, such as flexible immigration policies, favourable bankruptcy rules, and robust capital markets, are more crucial for tech success. 

European VC funding, for instance, lags behind the US, especially in later-stage funding rounds. Geography also plays a part, as the EU's diverse market, with its many languages and cultures, presents a different landscape compared to the large, homogeneous US market that tech giants like Google enjoyed in their early days. However, examples like Spotify show that European companies can still thrive despite these challenges. 

The article concludes that while regulation is important, it is just one of many factors influencing the success of tech innovation in Europe. To truly unlock its potential, Europe needs to address a range of issues, from immigration and bankruptcy policies to capital market dynamics and the complexities of its diverse market.
