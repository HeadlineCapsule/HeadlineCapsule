# 纽约立法者推动阻止基金针对主权债券的诉讼 

**纽约州立法者正提出一项法案，旨在遏制以新兴市场政府发行的主权违约债券为目标的“秃鹫基金”投资者的活动。该法案由州参议员[Liz Krueger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Krueger)和众议员[Jessica González-Rojas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gonzalez-Rojas)** **发起，旨在防止这些基金通过诉讼获取过高利润。由于约一半的新兴市场政府债券是根据纽约州法律发行的，因此该拟议立法对阿根廷、蒙古和斯里兰卡等国家具有重大意义**。

法案旨在区分拒绝重组谈判的“拒付”投资者和愿意谈判的传统债权人，明确允许法院通过恢复称为“**诉讼资助**”的法律原则来审查提起诉讼债权人的行为。此外，它还提议将主权违约债券支付后的罚息率从9%降低至当前约为5%的美国国库券一年利率。美国财政部负责国际事务的副部长杰伊·尚巴UGH等人士对此变化表示支持** **。这一改革纽约州关于[主权债务](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_debt)法律的一系列尝试中的最新举措，由于其针对性和对区分拒付和传统债权人的关注，该法案得到了比之前法案更积极的投资者回应** **支持者认为这种区别将增加法案通过的可能性；而华尔街的批评人士则警告可能出现的市场混乱，并对某些条款的可操作性表示担忧。

# New York Lawmakers Push to Block Funds' Sovereign Bond Litigation 

**New York lawmakers are introducing legislation aimed at curbing the activities of "vulture fund" investors who target defaulted sovereign bonds issued by emerging market governments**. The bill, sponsored by **state senator Liz Krueger and Assembly member Jessica González-Rojas**, seeks to prevent these funds from reaping excessive profits through litigation. With approximately half of all emerging market government bonds being issued under New York state law, the proposed legislation has significant implications for countries such as Argentina, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka. The bill aims to **distinguish between "holdout" investors who reject restructuring talks** and traditional creditors willing to negotiate by expressly allowing courts to scrutinize the behavior of litigious creditors through the restoration of the legal doctrine known as "**champerty**." Additionally, it proposes reducing penalty rates on post-default sovereign bond payments from 9% to the current one-year US Treasury bill rate of around 5%. This change has garnered support from figures such as Jay Shambaugh, the US Treasury's under-secretary for international affairs. The latest effort in a series of attempts to reform New York law on **sovereign debt** has received a more positive response from investors than previous bills due to its targeted approach and focus on distinguishing between holdout and traditional creditors. Backers argue that this distinction will increase the likelihood of the bill's passage, while critics from Wall Street warn of potential market disruptions and express concerns about the perceived unworkability of certain provisions.
