瑞士或将失去全球最富有的国家地位，UBS首席执行官警告称香港可能取而代之。

# 瑞士财富管理中心地位面临风险

瑞银（UBS）首席执行官塞尔吉奥·埃尔莫蒂（Sergio Ermotti）警告说，如果政策制定者对信贷瑞士的倒台和金融改革反应过度，瑞士可能会失去其作为全球财富管理中心的地位。他强调了包括瑞银在内的瑞士银行需要与香港、新加坡和美国等积极竞争对手进行国际竞争。

**要点：**
- 埃尔莫蒂警告说，如果瑞士不维持其金融生态系统中一个具有全球影响力的参与者，可能会被其他金融中心赶上。
- 他强调了香港、新加坡和美国在离岸财富管理领域的激烈竞争，该领域目前由瑞士占据领先地位。
- 埃尔莫蒂批评那些只关注大型银行设在瑞士的危险而不知其利弊的声音。
- 瑞银和瑞士当局之间的主要分歧在于是否要求国际子公司持有额外资本；今年提出的一项措施将主要影响瑞银。
- 分析师预测，该规则变化可能导致瑞银需要额外150亿美元至250亿美元的资本金。

**香港不断发展的财富管理部门：**
在演讲中，埃尔莫蒂展示了一张幻灯片，显示香港财富管理部门以7.6%的复合年增长率扩张，并预计到2027年将超越瑞士。新加坡也在迅速发展，增长率为9%，并将位居第三位。

**结论：**
为了保持领先地位，埃尔莫蒂认为瑞士金融生态系统必须包括像瑞银这样的具有全球影响力的参与者。他警告不要限制瑞士在国际上的竞争能力，因为这只会有利于外国金融中心而损害瑞士自身利益。

 **Switzerland's Wealth Management Hub Status at Risk**  

UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti warns that Switzerland could lose its position as the world's wealth management hub if policymakers overreact to Credit Suisse's fall and financial reforms. He emphasizes the need for Swiss banks, including UBS, to compete internationally against aggressive competitors like Hong Kong, Singapore, and the US.

**Key Points:**  
- Ermotti warns that Switzerland risks being overtaken by other financial centers if it does not maintain a globally relevant participant in its financial ecosystem.
- He highlights the aggressive competition from Hong Kong, Singapore, and the US for the offshore wealth management crown currently held by Switzerland.
- Ermotti criticizes uninformed voices focused on the dangers of having large banks based in Switzerland.
- The main sticking point between UBS and Swiss authorities is whether international subsidiaries should be required to hold additional capital, a measure proposed this year that would mainly affect UBS.
- Analysts predict that the rule change could lead to an estimated $15bn-$25bn of additional capital requirements for UBS.

**Hong Kong's Growing Wealth Management Sector:**  
During his speech, Ermotti displayed a slide showing Hong Kong's wealth management sector expanding at a compound annual growth rate of ^7.6%^ and set to overtake Switzerland by 2027. Singapore is also growing rapidly at ^9%^ and on course to be in third place.

**Conclusion:**  
To maintain its leading position, Ermotti argues that the Swiss financial ecosystem must include a globally relevant participant like UBS. He warns against restricting Switzerland's ability to compete internationally, as it would benefit foreign financial centers at their expense.
