# **伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱希在直升机坠毁事件中丧生** 

根据伊朗**国家媒体**报道，伊朗**总统**易卜拉欣·莱希在直升机坠毁事件中**丧生**。事故发生于周日该国西北部偏远山区，大雾和降雪天气给救援工作带来挑战。国家媒体公布的画面显示，一队救护车在雾气缭绕的山间道路上行驶。坠机地点确认为**阿拉斯巴拉森林**，靠近**阿塞拜疆边境**。 

直升机上还载有伊朗**外交部长**侯赛因·阿米尔-阿卜杜拉希安，他是莱希总统随行人员之一。他们刚刚结束在西北部**东阿塞拜疆省**的活动，与阿塞拜疆总统一同出席了一座大坝的落成典礼。 

63岁的莱希于2021年通过选举上台，该次选举的投票率历史性低迷。外界预计他将寻求连任，并被视为伊朗**最高领袖**哈梅内伊的潜在接班人。莱希以其对哈梅内伊的坚定忠诚和与**革命卫队**的紧密联系而闻名，在缓和总统办公室与最高领袖办公室之间的紧张关系方面发挥了作用。 

这一突发新闻仍在不断更新，更多细节有待披露。

# Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi Dead in Helicopter Crash

**Iran's President** **Ebrahim Raisi** has reportedly died in a helicopter crash, according to state media. The incident occurred on Sunday in a remote, mountainous region in the country's northwest, with rescue teams facing challenges due to fog and snow. Visuals from state media depicted a convoy of ambulances navigating through foggy mountain roads. The crash site was identified as the **Arasbaran Forest**, near the **Azerbaijan border**. 

On board the helicopter was also Iran's **foreign minister**, **Hossein Amir-Abdollahian**, who was part of President Raisi's entourage. They were returning from an event in the northwestern province of **East Azerbaijan**, where they had attended the inauguration of a dam alongside the president of Azerbaijan. 

President Raisi, 63, rose to power in 2021 through an election marked by a historically low voter turnout. He was anticipated to seek re-election and was considered a potential successor to Iran's **supreme leader**, **Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**. Raisi was known for his unwavering loyalty to the Ayatollah and his strong ties with the **Revolutionary Guard**, playing a role in easing tensions between the offices of the president and the supreme leader. 

This breaking news story is currently developing, and further details are expected to emerge.
