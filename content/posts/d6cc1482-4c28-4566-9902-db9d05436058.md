南非断电危机“已解决”，埃斯科姆公司称。

# **南非电力危机：转机已现？**

南非国有公用事业公司**Eskom** 一直在与一场长达十年的 **危机** 作斗争，这场危机导致频繁和严重的 **断电** 。然而，据 Eskom 的主席 Mteto Nyati 称，最糟糕的情况已经过去了，声称 **"结构性"** 问题已经得到解决，再次发生 "**轮流停电** "的可能性很小。这一声明是在至关重要的选举前夕做出的，执政的 **非洲国民大会 (ANC)** 正面临强大的反对力量。

这些断电或轮流停电已成为非国大经济管理不善的象征，使该国损失了数十亿美元。 Nyati 反驳了政府向 Eskom 施压以在选举期间保持供电的指控，声称最近的改善是由于针对 **表现不佳的燃煤电站** 和改进维护。

批评者仍持怀疑态度，认为柴油被用来暂时填补电力缺口。然而，Eskom 的数据显示与往年相比柴油支出急剧下降，表明可能已经找到了更可持续的解决方案。该公司能源可用率也有显着改善。 Nyati 将其归功于其董事会专注于解决特定电站的问题并改进纪律和标准操作程序。

业内专家一致认为维护恢复计划正在奏效，但挑战依然存在，Eskom 必须适应由 **可再生能源** 主导的未来。非国大解决轮流停电的能力可能会影响选举结果，一些人预测他们将失去多数席位。这篇文章提出了关于南非能源未来和政治在应对危机中所扮演角色的疑问。

## 有趣的问题：

1. **南非断电的原因是什么？**
   - 断电主要归因于 Eskom 的燃煤电站问题，这些电站占南非能源供应的一大部分。这些工厂的生产表现不佳和不可靠导致电网可用电力不足。这一问题由于缺乏维护以及这些设施在遵循标准操作程序方面的纪律松懈而变得更加严重。

2. **Eskom 是如何解决危机的，有何证据支持他们的说法？**
   - Eskom 重点关注表现不佳的燃煤电站，对其管理进行改革，并着重提高维护和运营紀律。该公司能源可用率从50.8%上升至70%，表明电网可用电力显著增加。此外，与往年相比柴油支出急剧下降，驳斥了关于在选举前采取临时措施的说法。

3. **轮流停电危机有何政治影响，如何影响南非未来的能源政策？**
   - 轮流停电已成为非国大经济管理不善的象征，使其在大选前失去大量支持。这场危机可能会促使务实的非国大调整其能源政策，加快向可再生能源转型。然而，在

# **South Africa's Power Crisis:** *A Turnaround in the Making?* 

**Eskom**, South Africa’s state-owned utility company, has been grappling with a **crisis** that has resulted in frequent and crippling **electricity blackouts** over the past decade. However, according to Eskom's chair, Mteto Nyati, the worst of the crisis is now behind them, claiming that the "**structural**" issues have been addressed and the chances of further **"load shedding"** are slim. This claim comes just days before a crucial election where the ruling **African National Congress (ANC)** is facing strong opposition. 

The blackouts, or load shedding, have become a symbol of the ANC's economic mismanagement, costing the country billions. Nyati refutes claims that the government pressured Eskom to keep the lights on for the elections, stating that recent improvements are due to targeting **underperforming coal-fired power stations** and improving maintenance. 

Critics remain skeptical, believing diesel was used to temporarily plug the electricity gap. However, Eskom data shows a sharp decline in diesel spending compared to previous years, indicating a more sustainable solution may have been found. The company's energy availability factor has also improved significantly. Nyati credits his board's focus on addressing issues at specific power plants and improving discipline and standard operating procedures. 

Industry experts agree that the maintenance recovery plan is working, but challenges remain, and Eskom must adapt to a future dominated by **renewable energy**. The ANC's ability to address load shedding may impact election results, with some predicting they will lose their majority. This article raises questions about South Africa's energy future and the role of politics in addressing the crisis. 

## Interesting Questions:

1. Q: What factors led to the electricity blackouts in South Africa? 
A: The blackouts were primarily due to issues with Eskom's coal-fired power stations, which make up a significant portion of South Africa's energy supply. Underperformance and unreliable output from these plants caused a shortage of electricity available for the grid. This was exacerbated by a lack of maintenance and discipline in following standard operating procedures at these facilities. 

2. Q: How has Eskom addressed the crisis, and what evidence supports their claims? 
A: Eskom targeted the underperforming coal-fired power stations, overhauling management and focusing on improving maintenance and operational discipline. The company's energy availability factor rose from 50.8% to 70%, indicating a significant increase in electricity capacity available for the grid. Additionally, diesel spending has decreased sharply compared to previous years, dispelling claims that temporary measures were used ahead of elections. 

3. Q: What are the political implications of the load-shedding crisis, and how might it impact South Africa's future energy policies? 
A: The load shedding became a symbol of the ANC's economic mismanagement, costing them significant support ahead of the election. This crisis may push the pragmatic ANC to adapt their energy policies and accelerate the transition to renewable sources. However, there are challenges in balancing investments between expanding the grid for renewables and extending the life of old coal-fired power stations. The outcome of the election will likely influence these decisions, with potential consequences for South Africa's energy future and environmental commitments. 

This article provides insight into a significant event in South Africa's recent history, highlighting the interplay between politics, energy policy, and crisis management.
