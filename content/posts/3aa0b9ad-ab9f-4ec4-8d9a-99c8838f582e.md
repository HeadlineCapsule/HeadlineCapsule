# 树莓派的IPO：伦敦股市的美味佳肴 

**树莓派**，一家英国微型计算机制造商，正准备在6月初进行**伦敦首次公开募股（IPO）**，估值约为5亿英镑。这一举措是伦敦科技行业的欢迎补充，因为该行业正面临着公开上市科技和成长型企业的短缺。凭借独特的商业模式和强劲的业绩记录，树莓派已经从一家教育初创企业发展成为一家利润丰厚的细分市场参与者，为制造企业提供技术支持。

该公司成功的原因在于其能够针对特定市场细分：那些产品和流程中需要技术，但又不需要专门制造能力的企业。这导致了40%的销售增长和超过60%的**息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）**的显著增长，实现了16%的利润率。如果树莓派能够保持这一销售增长率，那么根据同行比较，它在上市时将拥有相当高的**估值倍数**，潜在估值可能达到6.3亿英镑或更高。 

IPO的成功至关重要，因为它可能吸引更多科技公司来伦敦上市，也可能进一步缩小已经萎缩的公开交易科技股池。

# Raspberry Pi's IPO: A Tasty Treat for London's Stock Market 

**Raspberry Pi**, a British micro-computer maker, is gearing up for a **London initial public offering (IPO)** valued at around £500 million in early June. This move comes as a welcome addition to London's tech landscape, which has been facing a shortage of publicly listed tech and growth companies. With a unique business model and a strong track record, Raspberry Pi has evolved from an educational start-up to a lucrative niche player, serving the tech needs of manufacturing businesses.

**/**

The company's success lies in its ability to cater to a specific market segment: businesses that require technology in their products and processes but don't need dedicated manufacturing capabilities. This has resulted in a 40% sales growth and a significant **ebitda** increase of over 60%, achieving a 16% margin. If Raspberry Pi can maintain this sales growth rate, it is poised to command a substantial **valuation multiple** at listing, potentially reaching valuations of up to £630 million or higher, as suggested by peer comparisons. 

The IPO's success is crucial, as it could either attract more tech companies to list in London or further diminish the already shrinking pool of public tech stocks.
