# 英国审查结论：应禁止在国防和能源设施附近举行抗议活动

**约翰·伍德科克勋爵**受英国政府委托，针对政治暴力和破坏活动进行审查，审查建议在国防和能源基地周围实施**禁区**或**缓冲区**，以防止抗议活动并确保这些行业的弹性。该审查是针对**亲巴勒斯坦和环保人士**的活动增加而进行的，其中特别提到了**巴勒斯坦行动**团体在英国针对以色列军火贸易的直接行动。伍德科克强调了保护“关键能源供应和基础设施”的必要性，并呼吁采取措施解决“激进分子”恐吓工作人员的问题。该报告还建议支持更广泛地使用**特别警察命令**，以迅速阻止民主场所附近的公众抗议活动。该审查预计将于本月发布，并可能得到政府的支持，因为政府正在寻求更有效的方法来处理抗议团体造成的破坏性“炒作”。

鉴于巴勒斯坦行动最近袭击了**无人机战术系统**公司，这一干预是及时的，袭击中一辆卡车撞入大楼，活动人士爬上屋顶。7名活动人士被逮捕，其中1人被起诉。国防高管还担心，高校的反行业抗议活动会影响员工和潜在员工。来自贸易组织** ADS集团** 的**凯文·克拉文**强调了国防和安全部门对英国繁荣的重要性，同时支持和平抗议的权利，并对犯罪活动划清界限。

# Protests should be banned near UK defence and energy sites, review concludes 

**Lord John Woodcock's** review, commissioned by the UK government to tackle political violence and disruption, recommends implementing **exclusion zones** or **buffers** around defence and energy sites to prevent protests and ensure the resilience of these sectors. The review comes in response to increased activity by **pro-Palestinian and environmental campaigners**, with **Palestine Action** specifically mentioned for their direct actions targeting Israel's arms trade in Britain. Woodcock emphasizes the need to protect "vital energy supplies and infrastructure" and calls for measures to address the terrorizing of workers by "militants." The report also suggests backing the wider use of **special police orders** to quickly shut down public protests near democratic venues. The review is expected to be published this month and is likely to be embraced by the government, which seeks more effective ways to handle disruptive "stunts" by protest groups.

The intervention is timely, given the recent assault on **UAV Tactical Systems** by Palestine Action, which involved a lorry smashing into the building and activists scaling the roof. Seven activists were arrested, and one charged. Defence executives are also concerned about the impact of anti-industry protests at educational institutions on their staff and potential employees. **Kevin Craven**, from the trade body **ADS Group**, emphasizes the importance of the defence and security sectors to UK prosperity while also supporting the right to peaceful protest, drawing a clear line at criminal activity.
