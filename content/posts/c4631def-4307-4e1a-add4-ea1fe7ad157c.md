# 以民主换繁荣，印度人面临的错误选择

**印度民主** 处于十字路口，随着选举的临近，该国的经济道路和政治未来受到密切关注。**纳伦德拉·莫迪总理政府** 的**受欢迎程度**引发了争论，特别是在其日益严重的**威权主义**对该国经济繁荣的影响方面。本文探讨了印度经济表现与其选民政治选择之间的复杂关系。

虽然印度经济实现了整体增长，但收益分配不均，导致**两极分化经济**。中小企业以及皮革和纺织品等劳动密集型行业举步维艰，印度在全球服装贸易中的份额也在下降。这导致城市失业率上升，农业用工增加，对于一个发展中国家而言，这种情况并不常见。另一方面，钢铁和技术服务出口等行业蓬勃发展，使富人和中上阶层受益。

政府创造就业机会的战略受到批评，因为它过于关注通过补贴吸引制造业，包括为**芯片制造** 分配近100亿美元，但这可能创造的就业机会有限。与此同时，由于缺乏投资，劳动密集型行业正在萎缩。政府受欢迎的原因在于改善了福利发放，如免费粮食，以及通过宣扬经济成就和压制批评来影响公众认知的能力。

文章认为，民主的削弱可能会影响印度的发展前景。莫迪的支持者强调了威权国家在基础设施建设和制造业支持方面的优势。然而，印度面临着中国在开启出口导向型发展道路时不曾面临的挑战，包括来自中国的竞争和工业国的抵制。作者建议印度应发挥其在服务出口和民主方面的优势，并投资教育以培养高技能劳动力。

总之，印度选民面临着复杂选择，民主和繁荣之间的潜在权衡并不像看起来那么简单。强大的反对党和自由的新闻媒体对于一个健全的民主社会至关重要，这也会吸引外国投资者，并增强印度在数据密集型服务方面的可靠性。

# Trading democracy for prosperity is a false choice for Indians

**Indian democracy** is at a crossroads, with the country's economic path and political future under scrutiny in the lead-up to the elections. The **popularity** of **Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government** has sparked debate, particularly regarding the impact of its **growing authoritarianism** on the country's economic prosperity. This article delves into the complex relationship between India's economic performance and the political choices of its voters. 

/n/n

While India's economy has experienced overall growth, the benefits have been unevenly distributed, creating a **two-paced economy**. Small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as labor-intensive sectors such as leather and textiles, have struggled, with India's share in the global garments trade declining. This has resulted in growing urban joblessness and a rise in agricultural jobs, which is unusual for a developing country. On the other hand, sectors like steel and skilled services exports have thrived, benefiting the rich and upper middle class. 

/n/n

The government's job creation strategy has been criticized for its focus on attracting manufacturing through subsidies, including a nearly $10 billion allocation for **chip manufacturing**, which may create few jobs. Meanwhile, labor-intensive sectors are shrinking due to a lack of investment. The government's popularity is attributed to improved delivery of benefits, such as free food grains, and its ability to influence perceptions by touting economic successes and suppressing criticism. 

/n/n

The article argues that the erosion of democracy could impact India's growth prospects. Modi's followers highlight the advantages of authoritarian countries in infrastructure development and manufacturing support. However, India faces challenges that China did not when it embarked on its export-led path, including competition from China and resistance from industrial nations. The author suggests that India should focus on its strengths, such as services exports and democracy, and invest in education to develop a highly skilled workforce. 

/n/n

In conclusion, the choices facing Indian electors are complex, and the potential trade-off between democracy and prosperity is not as straightforward as it may seem. A strong opposition and a free press are crucial for a robust democracy, which can also attract foreign investors and enhance India's reliability in data-intensive services.
