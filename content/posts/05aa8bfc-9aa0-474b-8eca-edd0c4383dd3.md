穆巴达拉努力挽救对保险初创公司Wefox的投资

**穆巴达拉投资的困境与韦福克斯**

阿布扎比主权财富基金穆巴达拉（Mubadala）在挽救其对欧洲保险初创公司韦福克斯（Wefox）的投资方面面临挑战。该公司一直陷入一场关于其未来和潜在恢复选择的激烈董事会斗争：

1. 与竞争对手阿登纳格（Ardonagh）达成的协议，将一些核心资产估值为5.5亿欧元。
2. 由反对出售的投资者推动的新救助融资，他们相信韦福克斯可以独立实现盈利。

韦福克斯（Wefox）在穆巴达拉（Mubadala）领导的资金轮中迅速扩张和高估值45亿美元，但此后一直受到困难的困扰：

* 保险承保单位的现金流和陡峭的资金需求，反映了其他依靠低成本资金但现在面临紧缩金融环境的初创公司所面临的挑战。
* 在公共市场上竞争对手“保险科技”集团的估值暴跌。

当韦福克斯创始人朱利安·泰克（Julian Teicke）辞去首席执行官职务时，情况达到了临界点，该公司开始与阿登纳格（Ardonagh）进行出售关键部分的谈判，约3.5亿欧元的首付加上2亿欧元的额外收入支付，取决于达到某些里程碑。

由于其特殊条款，穆巴达拉（Mubadala）有权在其他股东有资格获得收益之前收到其投资的两倍，因此更有可能从出售中获利。然而，一些反对出售的韦福克斯投资者相信公司的潜力，并达成了自己的救助融资协议。

穆巴达拉和阿登纳格均拒绝对此事发表评论。

 **Mubadala's Investment Struggles with Wefox**  
The Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, is facing challenges in salvaging its investment in the European insurance start-up, Wefox. The company has been embroiled in a bitter board fight over its future and potential options for recovery have emerged:  

1. A deal with rival Ardonagh that values some core assets at €550mn.
2. New rescue financing put together by investors who oppose the sale, believing Wefox can achieve profitability on its own.

Woxef's rapid expansion and high valuation of $4.5bn in 2amoadala-led funding round have been overshadowed by difficulties since then:  

* Cash burn and steep funding requirements at the insurance carrier unit, mirroring challenges faced by other startups that relied on cheap funding but now face tight financial conditions.
* Plummeting valuations of rival "insurtech" groups in public markets.  

The situation reached a critical point when Wefox founder Julian Teicke stepped down as CEO, and the company began talks to sell key parts to Ardonagh for around €350mn upfront plus an additional €200mn in earn-out payments contingent on hitting certain milestones.  

Mubadala stands to gain more from a sale due to its special provision, which grants it the right to receive double its investment before other shareholders are eligible for proceeds. However, some Wefox investors who oppose the sale believe in the company's potential and have put together their own rescue financing deal.  

Both Mubadala and Ardonagh declined to comment on the matter.
