# **通胀** 的租金风险

**美国和英国经济学家** 正在密切关注租金成本，将其作为评估 **通胀** 走向的关键组成部分。尽管 **通胀** 的头条标题和核心指数预计将下降，但占通胀指数**较大份额**的租金成本却在上升。这是由多种因素造成的，包括 **市场租金与租户租约之间的时间差** 以及 **对住宿需求的增加**。因此，**租金通胀** 预计将持续上升，现有租金将赶上新租约的租金水平。这一点在美国和英国的 **通胀衡量标准** 中都有所体现，其中包含租金等值的通胀率高于不包含租金等值的通胀率。虽然关于衡量通胀的最佳方法存在**争议**，但租金上涨表明需求过剩，也是整体通胀的贡献因素。

# Inflation's Rental Risks 

**US and UK economists** are closely monitoring rental costs as a key component in assessing the trajectory of **inflation**. While **headline and core inflation rates** are expected to dip, rent costs, which account for a **significant portion** of the inflation index, are rising. This is due to a combination of factors, including the **lag between market rents and tenant leases**, as well as the **increased demand for accommodation**. As a result, **rent inflation** is expected to continue, with existing rents catching up to new tenancy rates. This is reflected in both the US and UK, where **inflation measures** that include rental equivalence are higher than those that exclude it. While there is **debate** over the best way to measure inflation, the **rise in rents** is a sign of **excess demand** and a contributing factor to overall inflation.
