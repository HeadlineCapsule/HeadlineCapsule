# 国际刑事法院对以色列的沉重打击和巨大赌博 

**国际刑事法院（ICC）决定寻求对本杰明·内塔尼亚胡、以色列总理、国防部长约阿夫·加兰特和哈马斯领导人的逮捕令，这给以色列造成了重大挫折。这一举动在以色列政界引起轩然大波，因为它暗示以色列在道德上与哈马斯这样的恐怖组织等同。 本文探讨了由此决定引发的四个关键问题：对以色列国内的影响；对加沙和中东地区的战争的后果；国际刑事法院是否越权，危及自身未来；以及** **美国的反应** **，考虑到其作为以色列的支持者和“基于规则的国际秩序”倡导者的角色。 

虽然以色列中间派政治家亚伊尔·拉皮德批评了法院的裁决，但这一举动的时机值得注意，因为内塔尼亚胡正面临下台的压力越来越大。 以色列战时内阁关键人物本尼·甘茨（未被国际刑事法院起诉）威胁说，如果内塔尼亚胡不尽快制定新的加沙战略，他将退出政府。 与此同时，随着以色列人日益认识到自己的国家正在成为** **“贱民国家”** **，他们可能会越来越倾向于用其他人取代内塔尼亚胡来改善国际形象。 

法院的起诉可能严重影响内塔尼亚胡作为总理的能力，增加他前往罗马规约缔约国的风险（不包括美国、俄罗斯和中国）。 乐观主义者希望这一行动能推动以色列认真考虑与巴勒斯坦建立两国解决方案。然而，许多以色列人辩称，这反而会危及他们国家的生存。 

**美国的反应至关重要** **。拜登总统最初谴责法院的判决是“荒唐的”，同时拒绝接受以色列和哈马斯在道德上的等同。 国务卿安东尼·布林肯声称国际刑事法院对以色列没有管辖权。与美国强烈的反弹形成对比的是，约翰-博尔顿（John Bolton）等人物呼吁对国际刑事法院实施制裁，这可能会在美国国会或特朗普竞选活动中获得支持，而美国的反应可能给法官带来压力而不批准起诉。 拜登陷入了两难境地：虽然美国不是国际刑事法院的成员国，但它声称支持基于规则的国际秩序，并曾欢迎对俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔-普京等对手的起诉。 

本文最后强调这一重大举措如何能影响全球对战争罪的看法，但也指出了潜在的陷阱——如果由于政治现实或来自俄罗斯、以色列或甚至美国的制裁威胁等强国的反击而无法将被起诉者绳之以法，会使盟友在国际上的声誉受到保护。

# A crushing blow for Israel and a massive gamble by the ICC 

**The International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to seek arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu**, **Israel’s prime minister, and Yoav Gallant**, its defense minister, as well as leaders of Hamas, deals a significant setback to Israel. The move has sparked outrage across the political spectrum in Israel due to the implication that Israel is morally equivalent to a terrorist organization like Hamas. This article explores four key questions arising from this decision: its domestic impact on Israel; consequences for the war in Gaza and the Middle East region; whether the ICC has overreached, risking its own future; **and how the United States will react**, given its role as a supporter of Israel and advocate for a "rules-based international order." 

**Yair Lapid**, an Israeli centrist politician, criticized the court's decision. Still, the timing of this move is notable, as Netanyahu faces growing pressure to step down from his position. **Benny Gantz**, a key figure in Israel’s war cabinet and someone who has not been indicted by the ICC, has threatened to leave the government unless Netanyahu formulates a new strategy for Gaza soon. While Gantz joins other Israeli leaders in condemning the ICC's decision, there is a growing realization among Israelis that their country is becoming a **pariah state**, which may make replacing Netanyahu an increasingly attractive option over time as they seek to improve their international standing. 

An indictment by the court could severely impact Netanyahu’s ability to function as prime minister, making international travel more difficult due to potential arrest risks in countries signatories of the Rome Statute establishing the ICC (excluding **the US**, Russia, and China). Optimists hope that such action might push Israel toward a serious consideration of a two-state solution with Palestine. However, many Israelis argue that this could endanger their country's survival instead. 

**The US response is critical**. President Biden initially denounced the court’s decision as "outrageous" while rejecting any moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. **Antony Blinken**, Secretary of State, claimed the ICC lacks jurisdiction over Israel. In contrast to the fierce reaction from America, which may pressure judges not to approve indictments, there are calls for sanctions against the ICC from figures like John Bolton (a lawyer and Trump's former national security adviser) that could gain traction within Congress or through Trump's campaign efforts. Biden finds himself in a delicate position: while the US isn't a member of the ICC, it claims support for international rules-based order and previously welcomed indictments against adversaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

The article concludes by emphasizing how this momentous step could shape perceptions about war crimes globally but also highlights potential pitfalls if those indicted cannot be brought to trial due to political realities or pushback from powerful nations like Russia, Israel, or even the United States itself through sanctions threats aimed at preserving its ally's reputation abroad.
