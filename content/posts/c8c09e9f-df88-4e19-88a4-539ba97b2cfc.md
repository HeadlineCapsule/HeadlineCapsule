## 顾问敦促习近平谨慎应对乔·拜登的贸易关税

**北京顾问** 敦促 **习近平** 在回应 **乔·拜登** 对价值 180 亿美元的中国进口商品征收关税时，谨慎行事，保持克制。这些 **关税** 主要针对电动汽车和太阳能电池，旨在在美国**大选**前夕保护美国的就业岗位。尽管中国有能力通过其在中国清洁技术供应链中的主导地位进行反击，但前官员和顾问警告不要与美国升级紧张关系。他们警告说，针锋相对的贸易战可能会对中国放缓的经济造成不利影响，并可能推动欧洲追随美国对中国出口实施限制。**王辉耀** 建议中国在此事中采取“道德制高点”。**张燕生** 也表达了同样的观点，他表示，此前的报复性措施对两国都造成了伤害，效果不佳。然而，西方专家预测，习近平将面临国内压力，被迫强硬回应。北京可能会寻找有针对性的“痛点”来展示实力，同时又不会牺牲自己的经济利益。中国反制措施的潜在领域包括关键技术出口，如**高端电脑芯片**，以及对**钨**和**稀土元素**等**关键矿产**的出口限制。尽管存在紧张局势，美国官员仍强调致力于稳定与中国的关系，即使他们采取必要的經濟和国家安全措施。美中贸易战已影响每年 4500 亿美元的贸易，如果紧张局势继续升级，专家警告全球经济将面临重大影响。

# Xi Jinping Urged to Respond with Caution to Joe Biden's Trade Tariffs 

**Beijing advisers** are urging **Xi Jinping** to exercise caution and restraint in responding to **Joe Biden's** recent tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese imports. The **tariffs**, primarily targeting electric vehicles and solar cells, are aimed at protecting American jobs in the lead-up to the **US election**. While China has the capability to retaliate due to its dominance in **cleantech supply chains**, former officials and advisers caution against escalating tensions with the US. They warn that a tit-for-tat trade war could negatively impact China's slowing economy and potentially push Europe to follow the US in imposing restrictions on Chinese exports. **Henry Huiyao Wang**, a former senior government official, advises China to take the "moral high ground" in this situation. This sentiment is echoed by **Zhang Yansheng**, who suggests that previous retaliatory measures have been ineffective and harmful to both countries. Western experts, however, predict that there will be domestic pressure on Xi Jinping to respond forcefully. Beijing is likely to search for a targeted "pain point" to demonstrate its strength without compromising its economic interests. Potential areas for Chinese countermeasures include critical technological exports, such as **high-end computer chips**, and restrictions on access to **critical minerals** like tungsten and **rare earth elements**. Despite the tensions, US officials have emphasized their commitment to stabilizing relations with China, even as they take necessary economic and national security measures. The US-China trade war has already impacted $450 billion in annual trade, and experts warn of significant global economic repercussions if tensions continue to escalate.
