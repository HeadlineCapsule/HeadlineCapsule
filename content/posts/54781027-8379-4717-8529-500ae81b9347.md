# 保守党右翼留给苏纳克最后一项任务

**段落 1**

虽然**反叛的保守党**阴谋家们已经放弃了在即将到来的选举之前罢免**里希·苏纳克**（Rishi Sunak）的党领袖职位，但他们已经将重点转向确保他要为预期的失败负责。这一战略调整是在该党在最近的地方和市长选举中表现不佳之后作出的。反叛者缺乏人数、可行的替代者或具体的计划来扭转局面，被迫不情愿地接受团结的呼吁。然而，这并不意味着休战，因为保守党右翼仍决心破坏苏纳克的领导地位。

**段落 2**

像**苏埃拉·布雷弗曼**（Suella Braverman）和**大卫·弗罗斯特**（David Frost）这样的知名人物公开批评苏纳克，表明他们打算为党的斗争承担责任。右翼派别，即**自由意志主义者**和**法拉吉派**联盟，尽管他们自己也在推动**伊丽莎白·特拉斯**（Liz Truss）灾难性的首相职位，但很快就指责他人，这疏远了选民，损害了保守党的品牌。他们不仅没有专注于改善选民生活或加强公共服务，反而加倍推行**核心投票策略**，忽视了通常决定选举结果的中间立场。

**段落 3**

保守党右翼拒绝承认他们自身对该党困境的贡献，这一点令人震惊。他们指责苏纳克没有“真正保守”，忽略了政府无能和公众生活水平下降等更根本的问题。即使他们在放弃领导权挑战时，他们仍然继续破坏苏纳克，因为他们知道他们的背叛和出卖的叙事将在党内受到欢迎。

**段落 4**

有选择的民意调查和夸张的言论加强了苏纳克的批评者，有影响力的保守党媒体，如《电讯报》、《邮报》和 GB 新闻也放大了他们的声音。他们主张向右转，尽管他们知道这不会改变选举结果，但会服务于他们的长期意识形态目标。右翼对苏纳克的指控包括在**移民**问题上过于软弱，维持高**税收**和**支出**，并对**净零议程**过于同情。

**段落 5**

他们对“完成”**英国脱欧**的痴迷，以及他们在移民问题上虚伪的背叛指控，突显出他们对 2019 年选举胜利的根本误解，那次选举是投票支持稳定和投资公共服务，而不是激进主义。保守党右翼的自私自利、违反规则和内讧疏远了选民，他们试图将过错转移到苏纳克身上，以掩盖他们在该党衰落中所扮演的角色。当苏纳克努力应对领导层的挑战时，党内的批评者似乎很乐意看到他失败，他们将意识形态议程置于党派的选举前景之上。

# The Tory Right Has One Last Job for Rishi Sunak 

**Paragraph 1** 

While **rebel Tory** plotters have abandoned their mission to oust **Rishi Sunak** as party leader before the upcoming election, they have shifted their focus to ensuring he is held responsible for the anticipated defeat. This strategic adjustment comes in the wake of the party's dismal performance in recent local and mayoral elections. The rebels lacked the numbers, a viable replacement, or a concrete plan to turn the tide, forcing them to begrudgingly accept unity calls. However, this does not signify a truce, as the Tory right remains determined to undermine Sunak's leadership. 

**Paragraph 2** 

Prominent figures like **Suella Braverman** and **David Frost** have publicly criticized Sunak, signaling their intention to assign blame for the party's struggles. The right-wing faction, an alliance of **libertarians** and **Faragists**, is quick to point fingers despite their own role in promoting **Liz Truss'** disastrous premiership, which alienated voters and damaged the Conservative brand. Instead of focusing on improving the lives of voters or strengthening public services, they have doubled down on a **core vote strategy**, neglecting the center ground that typically decides elections. 

**Paragraph 3** 

The Tory right's refusal to acknowledge their own contributions to the party's woes is striking. They blame Sunak for not being "genuinely conservative" enough, ignoring the more fundamental issue of governmental incompetence and the public's declining living standards. Even as they retreat from a leadership challenge, they continue to undermine Sunak, knowing that their narrative of betrayal and sellout will find a receptive audience within the party. 

**Paragraph 4** 

Sunak's critics are bolstered by selective polling and hyperbolic rhetoric, with influential Conservative media outlets like the Telegraph, Mail, and GB News amplifying their message. They advocate for a lurch to the right, knowing it won't change election results but will serve their long-term ideological goals. The right's charge sheet against Sunak includes accusations of being too soft on **immigration**, maintaining high **taxes** and **spending**, and being overly sympathetic to the **net-zero agenda**. 

**Paragraph 5** 

Their obsession with "completing" **Brexit** and their disingenuous claims of betrayal over immigration underscore a fundamental misunderstanding of the 2019 election win, which was a vote for stability and investment in public services, not radicalism. The Tory right's self-indulgence, rule-breaking, and infighting have alienated voters, and their attempts to shift blame to Sunak are a distraction from their own role in the party's decline. While Sunak grapples with the challenges of leadership, his critics within the party seem content to watch him fail, prioritizing their ideological agenda over the party's electoral prospects.
