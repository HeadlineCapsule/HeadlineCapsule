# Baidu Executive Departs Following 'I'm Not Your Mum' Controversy 

**Baidu's** public relations head, Qu Jing, has resigned from her position following a controversial series of social media videos that sparked backlash and shed light on the demanding workplace culture in China's tech industry. Qu's videos, intended to instruct staff on personal branding, instead highlighted the expectation of long hours and devotion to the company, with Qu infamously stating, "**I'm not your mum**, I only care about results." The incident has triggered a reevaluation of employer-employee relationships and the demanding "996" work culture prevalent in Chinese tech. Qu's proximity to Baidu's top brass, including founder **Robin Li** and his wife, Melissa Ma, who handles **HR**, further emphasized the impact of her comments. The controversy comes as Baidu, once a prominent player, faces challenges with stagnant growth and increasing competition in the **AI** chatbot space.
