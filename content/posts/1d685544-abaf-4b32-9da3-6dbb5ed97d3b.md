商学院教学案例研究：联合利华总裁暗示重新考虑环境、社会和治理问题。

## 摘要：
今年四月，联合利华新任首席执行官 Hein Schumacher 宣布将从其前任 Alan Jope 对负责任商业目标的关注中转移出来。该公司现采用一种 "务实的可持续性"方法，通过专注于更少但影响更大的承诺来平衡目的和利润，并延长环境、社会和治理措施的最后期限。这种变化反映了一种广泛的趋势：由于担心受到审查或被指控空洞声明，公司正在缩减其 ESG（环境、社会和治理）工作。

## 有趣的问题：
1. **Q:** 何因素促使联合利华新任 CEO Hein Schumacher 采取更平衡的方法来兼顾目的与利润？
   **A:** 该战略转变受到了长期价值创造需求的影响，重点关注客户和投资者，同时仍关注环境问题。这种变化也反映了行业的广泛趋势：由于担心受到审查或被指控空洞声明，各公司正在缩减其 ESG 工作。
   
2. **Q:** “务实的可持续性”方法与以前的战略有何不同，它有哪些潜在益处？
   **A:** 新策略专注于更少但影响更大的承诺，延长了 ESG 措施的最后期限，同时仍关注财务目标。这种平衡的方法旨在通过优先考虑客户和投资者来创造长期价值，而不会忽视环境问题，这可能导致更大的成功和可持续发展。
   
3. **Q:** 在将 ESG 标准纳入其沟通内容时，企业高管如何在目的和利润之间取得平衡？
   **A:** 高管应专注于通过将财务原则融入决策来创造长期价值，避免主要利用可持续性来提升社会形象和声誉。这种方法涉及优先考虑客户和投资者，同时通过更少但影响更大的承诺来解决环境问题，并延长最后期限。
   
4. **Q:** 在何种情况下目的对企业和品牌价值的影响是正面、中性的或负面的？
   **A:** 目的的影响取决于各种因素，如行业趋势、消费者偏好以及市场竞争。在某些情况下，强大的公司宗旨可能增强品牌声誉和客户忠诚度；而在其他情况下，如果与客户的需求和期望不一致，它可能会被视为多余的干扰甚至适得其反。
   
5. **Q:** 在某些情况下，品牌是否应该对社会问题采取立场？
   **A:** 如果与他们的价值观、使命或目标受众偏好相一致，品牌可以选择对社会问题采取立场。然而，必须仔细考虑这一决定，并权衡可能带来的风险，例如疏远持有不同观点的客户或面临反弹等。

## Summary:
In April this year, Unilever's new CEO Hein Schumacher announced a shift from his predecessor Alan Jope's focus on responsible business targets. The company is now adopting a "realistic sustainability" approach that balances purpose and profit by focusing on fewer but more impactful commitments with extended deadlines for environmental, social, and governance measures. This change reflects a broader trend of companies retracting their ESG efforts due to fear of scrutiny or accusations of empty claims, known as "greenhushing."

## Interesting Questions:
1. **Q:** What factors led Unilever's new CEO Hein Schumacher to adopt a more balanced approach between purpose and profit? 
   **A:** The shift in strategy was influenced by the need for long-term value creation, focusing on customers and investors while still addressing environmental concerns. This change also reflects broader industry trends of companies retracting their ESG efforts due to fear of scrutiny or accusations of empty claims.
   
2. **Q:** How does the "realistic sustainability" approach differ from previous strategies, and what are its potential benefits? 
   **A:** The new strategy focuss on fewer but more impactful commitments with extended deadlines for ESG measures while keeping financial objectives in sight. This balanced approach aims to create long-term value by prioritizing customers and investors without neglecting environmental concerns, potentially leading to greater success and sustainability.
   
3. **Q:** How can business executives strike a balance between purpose and profits when incorporating ESG criteria in their communications?

This approach involves prioritizing customers and investors while addressing environmental concerns through fewer but more impactful commitments with extended deadlines.
   
4. **Q:** Under what circumstances or conditions can the impact of purpose be positive, neutral, or negative on business and brand value? 
   **A:** The impact of purpose depends on various factors such as industry trends, consumer preferences, and market competition. In some cases, a strong corporate purpose may enhance brand reputation and customer loyalty, while in others it could be perceived as an unwelcome distraction or even backfire if not aligned with customers' needs and expectations.
   
5. **Q:** Are there instances when brands should take a stance on social issues?
