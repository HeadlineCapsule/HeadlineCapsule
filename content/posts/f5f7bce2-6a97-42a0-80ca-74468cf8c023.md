英伟达市值超过苹果，突破3万亿美元

**英伟达超越苹果成为市值第二的公司**

在人工智能（AI）芯片需求的推动下，英伟达市值达到3万亿美元，超过苹果成为全球市值第二的公司。周三，英伟达股价上涨约5%，使其市值首次超过苹果。这家美国芯片设计公司的增长令人难以置信，主要得益于谷歌、微软和元宇宙等科技巨头对其芯片的数十亿美元投资。

根据该公司领导者黄仁勋的说法，英伟达的数据中心芯片是推动新“工业革命”的人工智能模型的关键。该公司收入同比增长了262%，这在很大程度上归功于其当前一代“霍珀”芯片的销售。

尽管一些人担心存在不可持续的泡沫，但英伟达今年继续推动华尔街基准指数标准普尔500指数取得显着收益。该公司市值约为预期未来12个月收益的42倍，高于苹果的29倍，但仍低于去年人工智能热潮时的峰值。

英伟达在为日益苛刻的人工智能工作负载提供先进的硬件和软件工具方面继续领先。该公司每年承诺推出新芯片，“黑韦尔”产品在今年比许多分析师预测的要早产生显着收入。此外，英伟达的“鲁宾”处理器将于2026年开始发货。

苹果预计将在6月10日的年度全球开发人员大会上宣布自己的人工智能集成计划。尽管苹果没有参与围绕生成式人工智能的市场热潮，但首席执行官蒂姆·库克对前景保持乐观，并于5月份宣布了1100亿美元的股票回购计划。

 **Nvidia Surpasses Apple as Second-Most Valuable Company**

In an unprecedented surge driven by its artificial intelligence (AI) chips' demand, Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3tn. This milestone was reached as Nvidia's shares rose approximately amo

ut 5%, pushing its value ahead of Apple for the first time on Wednesday. The US chip designer has experienced incredible growth, largely due to tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta investing billions in its chips.

Nvidia's data center chips are integral to AI models that power a new "industrial revolution," according to the company's leader Jensen Huang. The firm has seen revenues increase by 262% year-on-year, thanks largely to sales of its current generation “Hopper” chips.

Despite concerns about an unsustainable bubble in some quarters, Nvidia continues to drive significant gains on Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index this year. The company is valued at approximately 42 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, which is higher than Apple’s 29x but still below last year's peak during AI euphoria.

Nvidia remains a leader in offering advanced hardware and software tools for increasingly demanding AI workloads. The company has promised new chips annually, with the "Blackwell" products generating significant revenue this year sooner than many analysts had forecast. Additionally, Nvidia's upcoming "Rubin" processors are set to start shipping in 2026.

Apple is expected to announce its own AI integration plans at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference on June tenth. Although Apple has been left out of market hype around generative AI, CEO Tim Cook remains bullish about its prospects and announced a $110bn share buyback in May.
