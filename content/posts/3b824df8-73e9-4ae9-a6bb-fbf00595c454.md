欧盟首次反补贴调查的目标是阿联酋买家

# 欧盟首次反补贴调查针对阿联酋买家

欧盟委员会即将启动其首次反补贴调查，涉及一个来自阿拉伯联合酋长国（UAE）的收购方参与的数十亿欧元的电信交易。调查将关注e&对捷克PPF集团在保加利亚、匈牙利、塞尔维亚和斯洛伐克电信资产的拟议收购。

## 要点：
- 欧盟委员会将调查阿联酋买家是否存在潜在的不公平补贴。
- 调查涉及e&对PPF集团四国电信资产22亿欧元的收购要约。
- 关注点是总部位于阿布扎比的公司是否收到国家资金，这可能会扭曲市场竞争并损害欧盟竞争对手。

## 背景：
欧盟最近加强了对海外投资流动的审查，去年通过了外国补贴法规。这项新政策旨在确保欧盟以外的公司不会在购买欧洲资产时从现金丰富的国家政府那里获得不公平的优势，例如中国。

## 当前情况：
委员会担心e&可能收到的国家资金及其对欧盟市场竞争的影响。调查将确定是否存在可能扭曲市场的补贴。由阿联酋政府控股的Etisalat此前已与PPF集团达成22亿欧元的交易，于8月买下了该集团在四国的电信资产，并获得了各国竞争监管机构的批准。

## 预期结果：
据直接了解此案的消息人士称，欧盟委员会预计最早于周一宣布对e&拟收购捷克PPF集团电信资产进行正式调查。这是外国补贴法规首次用于资产收购调查，标志着欧盟监管机构在监控海外投资方面迈出了重要一步。

## 结论：
欧盟委员会对e&收购PPF集团电信资产的调查是首次使用其外国补贴法规权力来审查一个涉及欧盟以外收购方参与的数十亿欧元交易。此次调查的结果将对未来海外投资影响深远，并为今后处理类似案件设定先例。

 **EU's First Anti-Subsidy Probe Targets UAE Buyer**  
The European Commission is set to launch its first anti-subsidy probe, investigating a multibillion-euro telecoms deal involving an acquirer from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The investigation will focus on e&'s proposed acquisition of Czech PPF group’s telecoms assets in Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Slovak

**Key Points:**  
- **EU Commission to investigate UAE buyer** for potential unfair subsidies.
- The probe concerns e&'s €2.2bn bid for PPF group’s telecom assets in four countries.
- Concerns revolve around whether the Abu Dhabi-based company received state funds, which could distort market competition and undermine EU rivals.

**Background:**  
The European Union has recently tightened scrutiny of overseas investment flows with its foreign subsidies regulation passed last year. This new policy aims to ensure that companies outside the bloc do not have an unfair advantage from cash-rich governments, such as China when buying European assets.

**Current Situation:**  
The commission is concerned about potential state funding received by e& and its impact on market competition within the EU. The investigation will determine if there were any subsidies that could distort the market. Etisalat, majority owned by the UAE government, has previously clinched a €2.2bn deal to buy PPF group’s telecom assets in August and received approval from national competition regulators.

**Expected Outcome:**  
The European Commission is expected to announce its formal investigation into e&'s proposed acquisition of the Czech PPF group’s telecoms assets as early as Monday, according to sources with direct knowledge of the case. This will be the first time that foreign subsidies regulation powers are used in an asset acquisition probe and marks a significant step for EU regulators in monitoring overseas investments.

**Conclusion:**  
The European Commission's investigation into e&’s proposed acquisition of PPF group’s telecom assets represents the first use of its foreign subsidies regulation powers to scrutinize a multibillion-euro deal involving an acquirer from outside the EU. The outcome of this probe could have far-reaching implications for future overseas investments in European markets and set precedents for how such cases are handled moving forward.
