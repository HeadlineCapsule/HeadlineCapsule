汇丰考虑在中国和印度为毕业生提供工作机会，此前英国的工作机会被取消了。

# 汇丰银行考虑在华、印、波三国提供职位

HSBC（汇丰银行）是最近因英国签证规则变化而**撤回海外毕业生录用通知**的雇主之一，现在正在考虑提供中国、印度和波兰的职位。该银行撤销了大约二十多位毕业生的录用通知，他们原本要加入汇丰银行的“数字创新”计划，担任网络安全、软件开发和数据分析等职位。

英国政府提高了熟练工人签证的工资门槛，以试图降低合法移民的水平。这一变化不仅影响了汇丰银行，也影响了KPMG（毕马威）和德勤等其他雇主。该银行现在正在探索机会，根据候选人的工作能力，在华、印、波三国雇用这些毕业生。

## 相关问题：

1. 汇丰银行决定在其他国家提供职位的决定可能会对其招聘策略产生什么影响？
   - 在其他国家提供职位可能导致汇丰银行重新考虑其全球人才获取和保留策略，并可能更多地关注国际市场。这也可能需要该银行适应不同地区的培训项目和支持系统，这些地区有不同的法规和文化背景。

2. 汇丰银行在将这些毕业生从英国职位过渡到中国、印度或波兰职位时可能会遇到什么挑战？
   - 将受影响的毕业生转移到新地点可能对汇丰银行提出多项挑战。这些挑战可能包括：应对不同的移民和签证流程；适应不同的工作文化和语言；解决与新就业国家的工作地点协助和支持系统相关的潜在问题。

3. 英国政府提高熟练工人签证工资门槛的决定可能会对其他行业或部门产生什么影响？
   - 提高工资门槛可能会对各个行业产生连锁反应，因为公司努力满足新的要求。这可能导致某些依赖外国工人的领域出现人才短缺，例如技术、医疗保健和学术界。此外，它可能会促使企业重新考虑其招聘策略，或在培训国内候选人担任专业职位方面投入更多资源。

## Summary:
HSBC, one of the employers that recently **withdrew job offers** for foreign graduates due to changes in UK visa rules, is now considering offering positions in China, India, and Poland. The bank had revoked offers from roughly two dozen graduates who were set to join HSBC's "digital innovation" scheme covering roles such as cyber security, software development, and data analysis.

The UK government raised the salary threshold for skilled worker visas in an attempt to reduce levels of legal immigration. This change has affected not only HSBC but also other employers like KPMG and Deloitte. The bank is now exploring opportunities to employ these graduates on similar schemes in China, India, and Poland, depending on the candidates' ability to work there.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How might HSBC's decision to offer positions in other countries impact its recruitment strategy?
A1: Offering positions in other countries could lead HSBC to reconsider its global talent acquisition and retention strategies, potentially focusing more on international markets. This may also require the bank to adapt its training programs and support systems for employees working across different regions with varying regulations and cultural contexts.

Q2: What challenges might HSBC face in transitioning these graduates from UK-based roles to positions in China, India, or Poland?
A2: Transitioning the affected graduates to new locations may present several challenges for HSBC. These could include navigating different immigration and visa processes, enscuplting employees with unfamiliar work cultures and languages, as well as addressing potential concerns related to relocation assistance and support systems in their new countries of employment.

Q3: How might the UK government's decision to raise the salary threshold for skilled worker visas impact other industries or sectors?
A3: The increase in the salary threshold may have a ripple effect on various industries and sectors, as companies struggle to meet the new requirements. This could lead to talent shortages in certain fields that rely heavily on foreign workers, such as technology, healthcare, and academia. Additionally, it might prompt businesses to reconsider their hiring strategies or invest more resources into training domestic candidates for specialized roles.
