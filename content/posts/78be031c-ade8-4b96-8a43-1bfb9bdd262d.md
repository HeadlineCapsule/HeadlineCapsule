# **民意调查显示：应调整资金分配以加强当地 NHS 服务**

**根据健康基金会和益普索最近的一项民意调查，公众舆论与政府对 NHS 的资金分配优先次序之间存在着显著差异。** 民意调查显示，**60% 的英国民众**赞成将资金优先分配给**社区医疗服务**，例如**全科医生和牙科服务**，而不是医院护理。这种偏好源于一种信念，即加强当地服务将**减轻医院压力**并**改善早期诊断和治疗**。

**民意调查还突显了英国民众为改善 NHS 服务而愿意支付更高税收的意愿**，他们倾向于支持一种**专款专用税**，以确保额外收入惠及医疗服务。考虑到到 2040 年，预计**重大疾病**患者人数将增加，而这些疾病中的许多本可以通过**初级护理**更好地管理，因此这一点尤其重要。

**尽管公众情绪如此，但近年来医院信托的资金增长明显高于社区信托**。这种差异导致了**全科医生短缺**，并加大了急性医院的压力。随着大选临近，**工党和自由民主党都打算将 NHS 作为主要竞选议题**，着重关注现任政府的记录和对医疗服务未来的计划。

# Reroute funding to boost local NHS services, says opinion poll

**A significant discrepancy exists between public opinion and the government's funding priorities for the NHS, according to a recent opinion poll by Health Foundation and Ipsos.** The poll reveals that **60% of Britons** favor prioritizing **funding for community healthcare services**, such as **GPs and dentistry**, over **hospital care**. This preference stems from the belief that strengthening local services will **reduce pressure on hospitals** and **improve early diagnosis and treatment**. 

**The poll also highlights a willingness among Britons to pay higher taxes** to improve NHS services, with a preference for a **hypothecated levy** that ensures extra revenue benefits the health service. This is particularly relevant given the projected increase in the number of people with **major illnesses** by **2040**, many of which could be better managed through **primary care**. 

**Despite public sentiment, hospital trusts have seen significantly higher funding growth** in recent years compared to community trusts. This discrepancy has contributed to a **shortage of fully-qualified GPs** and placed greater pressure on acute hospitals. As the country heads towards a general election, **both Labour and the Liberal Democrats intend to make the NHS a key campaign issue**, with a focus on the current government's record and future plans for the health service.
