# 保守党称工党面临“**非户主**”的“**黑洞**” 

保守党批评了工党通过瞄准**非户主人士**和堵塞**遗产税漏洞**来筹集资金的计划，声称其收入存在缺口。**财政分析**在预算之前进行，估计工党的拟议措施每年只会带来 5000 万至 1 亿英镑的收入，与他们声称的 4.3 亿英镑相去甚远。保守党将这一差异称为“黑洞”，并认为取消**信托保护**可能没有预期那样有利可图，甚至可能导致富人离开英国。 

工党反驳了这些说法，为其严格的成本计算进行了辩护。独立的**税务专家**也对财政部的计算提出质疑，认为其具有猜测性且可能过低。争论的焦点是取消遗产税对信托保护的真正财政影响，有人认为实际收入可能超过每年 1 亿英镑。人们承认存在不确定性，并呼吁政府提供更透明的数据和假设，以促进更好的分析。随着政治辩论的继续，人们担心这种不确定的局面可能会导致大量富有人群的外流，影响英国的税收收入。

# Labour faces non-dom 'black hole', Tories claim 

**Labour's plans** to raise funds by targeting **non-domiciled individuals** and closing **inheritance tax loopholes** have been criticized by the Conservatives, who claim a potential revenue shortfall. **Treasury analysis**, conducted pre-Budget, estimates that Labour's proposed measures will only bring in £50-£100 million annually, contrary to their claim of £430 million. This discrepancy has been labeled a "black hole" by the Tories, who suggest that **closing trust protections** may not be as lucrative as expected and could even drive wealthy individuals away from the UK. 

/n/n

Labour refutes these claims, defending their costings as rigorous. Independent **tax experts** also question the Treasury's calculations, deeming them speculative and potentially too low. The debate centers around the true financial impact of removing trust protections from inheritance tax, with some arguing the actual revenue could exceed £100 million annually. This uncertainty is acknowledged, with calls for more transparent data and assumptions from the government to facilitate better analysis. As the political debate continues, there are concerns that the perceived uncertainty could lead to a significant outflow of wealthy foreigners, impacting the UK's tax revenues.
