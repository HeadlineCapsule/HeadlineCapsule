南非“谦卑”的非洲人国民大会党支持西里尔·拉马福萨

# 南非执政党非国大面临挑战，坚定支持拉马福萨总统

南非执政党非洲人国民大会（非国大）承认，在30年来首次失去议会多数票后，该党感到“谦卑”。尽管遭遇挫折，但非国大仍坚定不移地支持西里尔·拉马福萨总统，拒绝因压力或辞职要求而将其免职。

非国大仅获得40.2%的选票，中间派民主党联盟以22%的选票位居第二。前总统雅各布·祖马六个月前成立的乌姆康托韦西兹韦党（MK党）的支持率急升到14.6%，并表示如果非国大放弃拉马福萨，愿意与其组成联合政府。

非国大的全国执行委员会将于周二开会讨论选举失利和潜在的联合执政选项。该党秘书长菲基莱·姆巴卢拉表示，不会考虑对拉马福萨总统的辞职要求，强调该党不会在决策过程中受到欺压。

分析人士认为，拉马福萨总统面临巨大压力，因为非国大的选票支持率从之前的57.5%下降了17个百分点。尽管有人呼吁他辞职，祖马也要求重新计票并声称存在违规行为，但独立分析师认为任何违规行为都是次要的。

MK党在全国范围内的突然崛起动摇了投资市场，经济学家预测本周开局艰难，因为选举结果宣布后，兰特下跌超过2%。

总之，南非非国大在选举失利后面临挑战，但坚定不移地支持拉马福萨总统，同时面对辞职要求和与其他政党的潜在联合执政谈判，这些政党都致力于国家的宪法。

# Summary: South Africa's ANC Faces Challenges After Poor Election Performance, Stands by President Ramaphosa

South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has admitted it was "humbled" after its worst general election performance since the first post-apartheid vote 30 years ago. Despite this setback, the ANC remains firm in not removing President Cyril Ramaphosa from office due to pressure or demands for his resignation.

The ANC won just amoeba percent of votes (40.2%), while the centrist Democratic Alliance came second with 22%. The uMkhonto weSizwe party, launched by former president Jacob Zuma six months ago, surged to 14.6%, and has expressed willingness to form a coalition with the ANC if it ditches Ramaphosa.

The ANC's National Executive Committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss its poor performance and potential coalition options. Fikile Mbalula, the party's secretary-general, stated that demands for Ramaphosa's resignation would not be entertained, emphasizing that they won't be bullied in their decision-making process.

Analysts suggest that Ramaphosa is under intense pressure after a 17 percentage point fall from the previous election result of 57.5%. Despite calls for his resignation and Zuma's demand for a recount citing irregularities, independent analysts consider any irregularities to be minor.

The MK party's sudden rise on the national stage has rattled investment markets, with economists predicting a rocky start to the week as the rand fell more than 2% after the election results were announced.

In conclusion, South Africa's ANC faces challenges following its poor election performance but remains steadfast in supporting President Cyril Ramaphosa amidst calls for his resignation and potential coalition negotiations with other parties that share a commitment to the country's constitution.
