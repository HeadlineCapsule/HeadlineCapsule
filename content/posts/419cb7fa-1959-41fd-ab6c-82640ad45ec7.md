标准渣打银行伊朗交易再曝举报人新说

# 最新法庭文件揭露了标准渣打银行（Standard Chartered，以下简称“渣打”）的内部人员举报其与伊朗相关实体进行数十亿美元交易的指控。

**举报人**声称，通过重新审查 2012 年和 2013 年提供的文件，他们发现了这些未曾披露的交易，其中包括受制裁的公司和恐怖组织。他们试图恢复 2012 年对该银行提起的诉讼，指控美国政府以缺乏实质性证据为由驳回他们的诉求时犯下了“巨大法庭欺诈”。

**新发现的数据**据称显示，在 2007 年宣布将停止与伊朗客户的所有新业务之后，渣打银行仍在 2008 年至 2013 年期间为像伊朗这样的流氓国家提供进入全球金融体系的途径。这些交易包括与伊朗相关受制裁实体价值 96 亿美元的交易以及与伊斯兰共和国相关的 1000 亿美元的外汇交易。

**举报人**，其中包括一位前渣打银行高管，多年来一直声称该银行参与了违反制裁的行为。自 2012 年以来，渣打银行因违反制裁和尽职调查不力而被处以超过 20 亿美元的罚款。

渣打银行驳斥了这些指控，称其为“被美国当局驳回的捏造说法”。该银行相信法院将像之前一样驳回这些新指控。

 **Summary:** 

A recent court filing has brought forth fresh whistleblower claims against Standard Chartered (StanChart), alleging that billions worth of previously undetected transactions were carried out with Iran-linked entities, including sanctioned companies and terror organizations. The whistleblowers claim to have uncovered this information by forensically re-examining documents provided in 2012 and 2013. They are seeking to revive a lawsuit filed against the bank in 2012, accusing the US government of committing "colossal fraud on the court" when it dismissed their claim for lacking substantive evidence.

The newly discovered data allegedly shows StanChart facilitating access to the global financial system for rogue nations like Iran between 2008 and 2013, despite announcing in 2007 that they would cease all new business with Iranian customers. The transactions include dealings with sanctioned entities related to Iran totaling $9.6 billion and forex transactions tied to the Islamic Republic with a notional value of $100 billion.

The whistleblowers, including a former StanChart executive, have made claims over several years regarding the bank's involvement in sanctions violations. Since 2012, StanChart has faced penalties totaling more than $2 billion for sanctions violations and due diligence failures.

StanChart has dismissed these allegations as "fabricated claims" that have been discredited by US authorities. The bank remains confident the courts will reject these new claims, just as they have done in previous instances.
