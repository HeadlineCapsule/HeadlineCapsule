# **杰里米·亨特**在保守党转向竞选模式时暗示大选前减税 

**英国财政大臣杰里米·亨特**暗示可能在**大选前减税**，希望吸引选民，并抵消**工党**在民意调查中不断增长的领先优势。亨特的竞选演说专注于指责工党在其支出计划中有一个“**黑洞**”，声称他们将需要每户工作家庭多收 2,100 英镑的税收以履行其承诺。亨特将其与自己降低国民保险费率的记录相比较，并表示如果财政条件允许，他希望进一步降低国民保险费率，目标是 6% 的费率。财政大臣的演讲背景是一块没有保守党标志的红色背景板，这标志着保守党转向更加以竞选为导向的方法，亨特和**首相里希·苏纳克**试图诋毁工党及其领袖**基尔·斯塔默爵士**。工党反驳了亨特关于工党计划存在资金缺口的说法，称这一举动是“绝望的”，并重申了其对负责任财政管理的承诺。随着英国经济出现改善迹象，GDP 增长速度超过其他欧洲国家，亨特承诺保守党政府将优先考虑减税，尽管最近税收已升至战后最高水平。财政研究所支持这一说法，预计到下次选举时，税收收入将显著增加。

# Jeremy Hunt Signals Pre-Election Tax Cut as Tories Shift to Campaign Mode 

**Jeremy Hunt**, the UK **Chancellor of the Exchequer**, has signaled a potential **pre-election tax cut**, aiming to appeal to voters and counter the growing lead of the **Labour Party** in opinion polls. Hunt's electioneering speech focused on accusing Labour of having a "**black hole**" in their spending plans, claiming they would need to raise taxes by £2,100 per working household to meet their commitments. Hunt contrasted this with his own record of reducing national insurance rates and expressed his desire to cut them further, targeting a rate of 6p if financial circumstances permit. The Chancellor's speech, delivered in front of a red backdrop devoid of Conservative branding, marked a shift towards a more campaign-oriented approach for the Tories, with Hunt and **Prime Minister Rishi Sunak** seeking to discredit Labour and their leader, **Sir Keir Starmer**. Hunt's allegations of a funding gap in Labour's plans were refuted by the party, who criticized the move as "desperate" and reaffirmed their commitment to responsible fiscal management. As the UK economy shows signs of improvement, with GDP growth outpacing other European countries, Hunt promises that a Conservative government would prioritize tax cuts, despite the recent rise in taxes to post-war highs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies supports this claim, projecting tax revenues to be significantly higher by the time of the next election.
