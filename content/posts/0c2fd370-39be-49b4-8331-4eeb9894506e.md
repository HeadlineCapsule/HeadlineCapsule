苏黎世保险集团和安盛集团推出保险计划，以促进氢能发展

**苏黎世保险集团和安盛集团推出氢能发展保险计划**

保险公司苏黎世保险集团（Zurich）和经纪公司安盛集团（Aon）联合创建了一个保险计划，旨在促进氢生产的发展，这是向清洁能源转型的一个关键部门。该平台将为 vốn支出最高达2.5亿美元的小型项目提供承保，而这些项目否则会难以获得保险覆盖。

**要点：**
- 保险往往决定了小型项目能否继续进行。
- 该计划针对两种关键的低碳氢生产方法：捕获排放的天然气和从水中的可再生电力拆分。
- 苏黎世保险集团将与其他保险公司合作，成为每个项目的领头保险公司。
- 氢作为一种更环保的化石燃料替代品具有巨大的潜力。
- 该计划旨在涵盖氢基础设施，包括生产、存储和运输。

**挑战：**
- 全球只有7%的清洁氢项目做出了最终投资决策。
- 新的低碳生产将该行业推向了新的领域，而这些风险尚未得到充分理解。

该保险计划已经开发了两年，现在正在为其第一个项目报价，每年有望为10到20个项目提供政策，总保额达数十亿美元。

 **Zurich and Aon Launch Insurance Scheme for Hydrogen Development**

Insurers Zurich and broker Aon have created an insurance scheme aiming to boost the development of hydrogen production, a vital sector in transitioning to clean energy. The platform will underwrite smaller projects up to $250 million in capital expenditure that would otherwise struggle to find coverage.

**Key Points:**
- Insurance often determines whether smaller projects can proceed or not.
- The scheme targets two key low carbon methods of producing hydrogen: natural gas with emissions capture and renewable electricity splitting from water.
- Zurich will be the lead insurer on each project, in combination with other insurers.
- Hydrogen has immense potential as a greener alternative to fossil fuels.
- The scheme is intended to cover hydrogen infrastructure including production, storage, and transportation.

**Challenges:**
- Only 7% of clean hydrogen projects worldwide have received final investment decisions.
- New low-carbon production takes the sector into new areas with risks that aren't yet fully understood.

The insurance facility has been in development for two years and is now quoting for its first projects, potentially providing policies for 10 to 20 projects a year, with total coverage running into billions of dollars.
