布鲁塞尔将就赤字问题批评法国，而开支冲突即将爆发

# 欧盟委员会计划因法国违反欧盟预算规则而对其进行训诫

欧盟委员会计划因法国在2023年超过GDP的3%的上限而违反欧盟预算规则，对其进行训诫。除了法国之外，还有其他六个国家将面临过度赤字程序：意大利、比利时、马耳他、斯洛伐克、匈牙利和波兰。这一举动是在法国即将举行大选之际做出的，极右翼政党**全国联盟**（RN）和左翼政党**新人民阵线**（NPF）预计将获胜。这两个党派都做出了巨大的支出承诺，这可能与欧盟的预算规则相冲突，因此人们担心法国是否能遵守规则，以及是否会出现财务动荡。

 **Summary:**  
The European Commission plans to reprimand France for breaching EU budget rules by exceeding its borrowing limit of 3% GDP in 2023. Alongside France, six other countries will also face an excessive deficit procedure. This move comes as France approaches snap elections with the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) and leftwing New Popular Front (NPF) expected to win. Both parties have made significant spending pledges that may conflict with EU budget rules, raising concerns about compliance and potential financial turmoil in France.

**Key Points:
1. European Commission reprimands France for breaching EU borrowing limit of 3% GDP.
2. Six other countries (Italy, Belgium, Malta, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) also face excessive deficit procedures.
3. Snap elections in France with RN and NPF expected to win; both parties have made lavish spending pledges.
4. Concerns about compliance with EU budget rules and potential financial turmoebility in France due to conflicting fiscal policies.**
