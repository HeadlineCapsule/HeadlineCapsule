# **中国科技企业**寻求在中东扩张

随着**中国**寻求多元化与其对**重进口**的中东关系，主要是**沙特阿拉伯**，一系列**中国科技公司**正在进军该地区。这一举措意义重大，因为它代表了中国科技公司全球扩张计划的第一波行动，而沙特阿拉伯则是它们在国内市场以外的第一个目的地。

**美团**，一家食品配送巨头，正在利雅得招聘员工，这是其第一次海外扩张。**阿里巴巴**正在**沙特阿拉伯**和**阿拉伯联合酋长国**建立当地合作伙伴关系，而**腾讯**则在数据存储和云业务扩张上进行投资。**希音**，一家快时尚和电子商务公司，也通过在沙特阿拉伯的时装秀和真人秀增加了其存在。

这一转变的原因有两方面。首先，**地缘政治紧张局势**影响了像美国这样的大型市场对中国应用程序和技术的需求。另一方面，中东提供了一个在政治上更中立的环境，同时拥有强大的经济联系。其次，中国经济放缓促使这些科技公司寻求新的市场，这一点在阿里巴巴、腾讯和美团最近的财务报告中得到了证明。

这一时机对双方都有利。沙特阿拉伯渴望投资**人工智能**等新兴产业，为此设立了1000亿美元的基金，同时希望使其经济多元化，不再过度依赖化石燃料。同时，中国也希望加强与沙特阿拉伯的关系，以维持其作为该国最大石油供应国的地位，这一地位最近受到了俄罗斯的威胁。

双方对经济增长和技术进步的共同兴趣为**中国科技**企业在中东地区显著扩张影响力奠定了基础，这可能对双方都带来益处。

# China Tech is Seeking Growth in the Middle East 

As **China** seeks to diversify its import-heavy relationship with the Middle East, primarily **Saudi Arabia**, a string of **Chinese tech companies** are expanding into the region. This move is significant as it represents the first wave of Chinese tech's aggressive global expansion plans, with Saudi Arabia serving as the chosen destination for their first ventures outside of their domestic market. 

**Meituan**, a food delivery giant, is looking to hire staff in Riyadh, marking their first overseas expansion. **Alibaba** is working on local partnerships in Saudi Arabia and the **United Arab Emirates**, while **Tencent** is investing in data storage and cloud business expansion. **Shein**, a fast fashion and e-commerce company, has also increased its presence through fashion shows and a reality show in Saudi Arabia. 

The motivation behind this shift is twofold. Firstly, **geopolitical tensions** have impacted the demand for Chinese apps and technology in large markets like the US. The Middle East, on the other hand, offers a more politically neutral environment with strong economic ties. Secondly, an **economic slowdown** in China has prompted these tech companies to seek new markets, as evidenced by recent financial reports from Alibaba, Tencent, and Meituan. 

The timing is advantageous for both parties. Saudi Arabia is eager to invest in emerging industries like **AI**, creating a $100 billion fund for this purpose, while also aiming to diversify its economy beyond fossil fuels. Meanwhile, China is interested in strengthening ties with Saudi Arabia to maintain its position as the country's top oil supplier, a title recently threatened by Russia. 

This mutual interest in economic growth and technological advancement sets the stage for a significant expansion of Chinese tech influence in the Middle East, with potential benefits for both regions.
