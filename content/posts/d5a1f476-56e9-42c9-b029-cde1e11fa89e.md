美国监管机构批准了耗资300万美元的肌肉消耗症治疗方法

## 美国监管机构批准 300 万美元的基因疗法用于肌肉萎缩疾病，萨雷普塔股票飙升

美国监管机构已批准生物技术公司 **Sarepta Therapeutics** 的基因疗法治疗 Elevidys。这种突破性药物旨在治疗一种罕见的肌肉萎缩疾病——杜希氏肌强直，该疾病影响着美国约 15,000 名儿童和年轻人。

**美国食品药品监督管理局 (FDA)** 已批准 Sarepta Therapeutics 扩大 Elevidys 的使用范围，这是一种每位患者费用为 320 万美元的基因疗法。该治疗方法之前仅可供 4 岁和 5 岁的儿童使用，但现在将可供所有 4 岁及以上、仍能行走或使用轮椅的患者使用。

杜希氏肌强直是一种会导致身体破坏自身肌肉纤维的疾病，许多患病者到了青春期早期就需要依靠轮椅，平均寿命仅为 22 岁。这种疾病尤其影响男孩，每 3500 个新生男婴中就有 1 个受其影响。

萨雷普塔的股票在 FDA 批准后飙升了 40%，使这家生物技术公司的市值超过 160 亿美元。预计该公司 2027 年的峰值年收入将达到 33 亿美元，比去年的 11 亿美元有所增长，这得益于 Elevidys 的销售。

然而，Elevidys 因其高昂的价格和对有效性的质疑而受到批评。临床和经济审查研究所（一个评估药物价格的非营利性机构）上个月表示，尽管该治疗方法在运动功能测试中未能达到主要终点，但它却带有“巨大的价格标签”。

萨雷普塔 CEO Doug Ingram 表示，任何客观、科学思维的人都会意识到，这种治疗方法为患者带来了更好的生活，他们应该有机会获得这种治疗。Elevidys 在其他测试中取得了成功，包括提高患者行走 9 米速度的测试。

FDA 的决定为 Sarepta Therapeutics 开辟了一个巨大的潜在市场，由于 Elevidys 的成功，该公司一直被视为可能的收购目标。Ingram 表示，虽然该公司希望“掌握自己的命运”，但如果有任何事情发生，他们会谨慎对待。

 ## US Regulators Approve $3M Gene Therapy for Muscle Wasting Disease, Sarepta Shares Soar

US regulators have granted approval to biotech company **Sarepta Therapeutics** for its gene therapy treatment called Elevidys. This groundbreaking medicine is designed to treat a rare muscle wasting disease known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects an estimated 15,000 children and young adults in the US.

The **US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** has given Sarepta Therapeutics the green light to expand access for Elevidys, a gene therapy that costs $3.2 million per patient. The treatment was previously available only to children aged four and five years old but will now be accessible to all patients aged four and over who are still able to walk or using a wheelchair.

Duchenne muscular dystroebacteria, which causes the body to erode its own muscle fibers, leaving many affected individuals reliant on a wheelchair by their early teenage years with an average life expectancy of just 22 years. The condition particularly impacts young boys, with one in every 3,500 live male births being affected.

Sarepta's shares soared as much as 40% after the FDA approval, giving the biotech a market value of more than $16 billion. The company is projected to generate peak annual revenues of $3.3 billion in 2027, up from $1.1 billion last year, driven by sales of Elevidys.

However, Elevidys has faced criticism for its high cost and questions about its effectiveness. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an influential non-profit that assesses drug prices, wrote last month that the treatment came with "an enormous price tag" despite failing its primary endpoint as measured by a motor function test.

Sarepta's CEO Doug Ingram stated that any objective, scientifically minded person would realize that this treatment is bringing a better life to patients and they deserve access to it. Elevidys did succeed on other tests, including improving patients’ speed in walking nine meters.

The FDA decision opens up a huge potential market for Sarepta Therapeutics, which has been considered as a likely acquisition target due to the success of Elevidys. Ingram said that while the company wants to be "masters of our destiny," it will be thoughtful in the event that anything is broached with them.
