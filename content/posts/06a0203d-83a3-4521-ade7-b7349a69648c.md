慢而稳胜快而不稳

# 摘要：
本文对比了科技公司 HP Inc. 和 Salesforce 的表现。HP Inc. 是一家增长较慢的公司，以个人电脑和打印机为主要产品，而 Salesforce 是一家快速增长的网络客户管理软件提供商。尽管 Salesforce 在过去几年的收入和收益增长令人印象深刻，但 HP 在总回报方面自 2015 年底从 HP Enterprise 分拆以来表现更好。文章强调，尽管近期成长股普遍表现优于价值股，但股票的价格对整体表现仍起着重要作用。目前，Salesforce 的估值与其历史相比偏高，而 HP 根据收益倍数标准被认为更便宜。

## 问题：

1. 为什么 HP Inc. 在总回报方面表现优于 Salesforce，尽管它增长较慢，产品线也缺乏光彩？
   - 文章表明，股票的价格对其整体表现至关重要。尽管 Salesforce 具有令人印象深刻的增长率，但目前其估值与其历史相比偏高，而 HP 的收益倍数更低，被认为更便宜。这种估值差异导致 HP 自从与 HP Enterprise 分拆以来在总回报方面表现优于 Salesforce。

2. 大科技股票的近期表现如何影响市场的广度和可持续性？
   - 文章提到，尽管在一段短暂的时间里，市场收益在较小公司中更加均匀分布，但大科技股票再次开始主导 S&P 500 指数。这种趋势引发了人们对投资者应如何看待集中市场的担忧，并提出了科技部门可能存在不可持续泡沫的信号。

3. 哪些因素可能导致大科技股票（尤其是英伟达）近期表现强劲？
   - 虽然英伟达出色的收益被列为其强劲表现的原因之一，但可能还有其他潜在原因导致大科技公司主导地位的重新崛起。这些原因可能包括投资者对科技公司的看好、有利于技术驱动型企业的市场趋势，或对这些股票产生影响的特定事件（尚未在本文中充分探讨）。

**Summary:**
The article discusses the contrasting performance between two tech companies - HP Inc., a slower-growing company with PCs and printers as its main products, and Salesforce, a fast-growing web-based customer management software provider. Despite Salesforce's impressive growth rates in revenue and earnings over the years, HP has outperformed it in terms of total return since their split from HP Enterprise in late 2015. The article highlights that even though growth stocks have generally performed better than value stocks recently, the price paid for a stock still plays a significant role in its overall performance. Currently, Salesforce trades at an expensive valuation compared to its history, while HP is considered cheaper based on earnings multiples.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: Why has HP Inc., despite being slower-growing and having a less glamorous product lineup, outperformed Salesforce in terms of total return since their split from HP Enterprise?
   A: The article suggests that the price paid for a stock plays an essential role in its overall performance. Despite Salesforce's impressive growth rates, it is currently trading at an expensive valuation compared to its history, while HP trades at a cheaper multiple of earnings. This difference in valuation has contributed to HP outperforming Salesforce in terms of total return since their split from HP Enterprise.

2. Q: How does the recent performance of Big Tech stocks impact market breadth and sustainability?
   A: The article mentions that, despite a brief period where market gains were more evenly distributed among smaller companies, Big Tech stocks have once again started to dominate the S&P 500. This trend raises questions about how much a concentrated market should concern investors and whether it could potentially signal an unsustainable bubble in the tech sector.

3. Q: What factors might be contributing to the recent surge in performance of Big Tech stocks, particularly Nvidia?
   A: While excellent earnings from Nvidia are mentioned as a factor for its strong performance, there may be other underlying reasons behind the resurgence of Big Tech's dominance. These could include investor sentiment towards tech companies, market trends favoring technology-driven businesses, or specific events impacting these stocks that have not been fully explored in the article.
