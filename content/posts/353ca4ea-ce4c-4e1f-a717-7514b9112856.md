# **雪佛龙** 决定退出**英国北海**石油业务，出售其资产

**雪佛龙**决定退出**英国北海**石油业务，结束在该地区超过 55 年的运营，出售其剩余的石油和天然气资产。此举是该公司的全球投资组合评估和重点转向更新油田的结果，而非受**英国**税收制度或政治因素影响。**雪佛龙**此举与**埃克森美孚**、**英国石油**和**壳牌**等其他石油巨头退出老油田的步调一致。该交易包括出售**雪佛龙**在**克莱尔油田**的股份，该油田是**北海**最大的油田之一，但不会影响其在**英国**的其他业务。值得注意的是，该公司计划收购**赫斯公司**，并与**埃克森美孚**在**圭亚那**的资产展开法律争夺。在即将到来的**英国大选**中，该行业的未来和税收很可能会成为关键议题，**工党**提议提高税收，而**苏格兰民族党**和**保守党**则争夺该地区的支持。

# Chevron to sell UK North Sea assets as it exits ageing oil basin

After more than 55 years of operations in the region, **Chevron** has decided to exit the **UK North Sea** by selling its remaining oil and gas assets. This decision is part of the company's global portfolio review and a shift in focus towards newer oilfields, rather than a response to the UK's tax regime or political factors. With this move, Chevron joins other oil majors like **ExxonMobil**, **BP**, and **Shell** in leaving the ageing basin. The sale will include Chevron's stake in the **Clair oilfield**, one of the largest in the North Sea, but it won't impact its other UK operations. The company's planned acquisition of **Hess** and the legal battle with **ExxonMobil** over assets in **Guyana** are also worth noting. The industry's future and taxation are likely to be key topics in the upcoming **UK general election**, with the **Labour party** proposing higher taxes and the **Scottish National party** and **Conservatives** vying for support in the region.
