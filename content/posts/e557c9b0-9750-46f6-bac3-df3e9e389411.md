## **英国受污染血液丑闻调查**：主要发现

--- 

席朗斯塔夫爵士（Sir Brian Langstaff）对英国受污染血液丑闻的**长期调查报告**揭露了一系列令人不安的结果。这项长达六年的调查聚焦于 20世纪70年代到90年代初，英国有3万人因 **受污染的血液制品**而感染了**艾滋病病毒**( **HIV**)、**丙型肝炎**和其他疾病。这份报告强调指出政府部门和国民医疗服务体系（NHS）内部存在“系统性、集体性和个体性的失误”，导致了这场灾难，造成超过3000人死亡和大范围的破坏。

一个主要的关注点是，位于英国南部汉普郡的一所专门寄宿学校里，**血友病**儿童被作为 “研究对象” 接受治疗，而且没有得到他们的同意。证据表明，尽管卫生官员意识到该项目的风险，但临床医生依然对这些孩子进行了治疗。调查发现，在接受了来自医生提供的血液产品后，几乎所有学生都未能幸免感染，而这些医生更热衷于研究进展而不是学生的福祉。这所学校在1970年至1987年期间，只有30名在读的122名患有血友病的孩子存活了下来。

此外，朗斯塔夫报告还指责政府和卫生官员“明知故犯地欺骗”，包括销毁文件以逃避责任并减少开支。与 **艾滋病**诉讼和血液安全有关的某些档案被蓄意销毁，因为它们可能会给政府在延迟引入丙型肝炎捐赠筛查方面带来负面影响。还有一些涉及受污染产品的个人患者病历也被销毁，这表明当时盛行“**医生最清楚**”的文化，而不是提供适当的指导并遏制不安全做法。 

调查还强调指出，早在1982年，英国卫生部门就未能重视关于 **艾滋病通过血液传播** 的警告。这种不作为给血友病患者带来了不必要的痛苦，他们不得不依赖进口的美国治疗药物，直到1990年，因为当时英国缺乏自产药品。朗斯塔夫指出，国民医疗服务体系（NHS）对这些有风险的进口产品持否认态度，声称考虑到它们的已知风险以及出血性疾病的安全替代方案的存在，它们本不应该被分发下去。 

最后，调查发现医生曾不必要地授权**受污染血液输血**，特别是在产后女性中，这加剧了人们对 **血液安全措施** 的普遍懈怠态度。80到100人因这些不必要的程序而感染艾滋病病毒，另有惊人的26,800人感染了丙型肝炎。

# **UK Infected Blood Inquiry**: Key Findings 

---

**Sir Brian Langstaff's** long-awaited report on the UK's infected blood scandal has revealed a series of disturbing findings. The inquiry, which spanned six years, focused on how 30,000 individuals in the UK were infected with **HIV**, **hepatitis C**, and other diseases through contaminated blood products between the 1970s and early 1990s. The report highlighted "systemic, collective, and individual failures" within government departments and various parts of the NHS, leading to a calamity that has claimed over 3,000 lives and caused widespread devastation.

One key area of concern was the treatment of children with **haemophilia**, a rare blood condition, at a specialist boarding school in Hampshire, southern England. Evidence showed that clinicians treated these children without their consent as "objects for research," even though health officials were aware of the risks associated with the programme. The inquiry found that very few pupils escaped infection after receiving blood plasma products from doctors more interested in research advancement than pupil wellbeing. Only 30 out of 122 pupils with haemophilia, who attended between 1970 and 1987, are still alive today. 

Furthermore, Langstaff's report accused government and health officials of "downright deception," including the destruction of documents to save face and expenses. Certain files relating to HIV litigation and blood safety were deliberately destroyed due to their potential negative reflection on the government regarding delays in introducing screening for hepatitis C donations. Individual patient medical records involving contaminated products were also destroyed, indicating a culture where **"Doctor knows best"** prevailed over proper guidance and curbing unsafe practices. 

The inquiry also highlighted the failure of the UK's health department to address warnings about **AIDS transmission through blood** as early as 1982**.** This inaction caused needless suffering for those with haemophilia, who had to rely on imported US treatments until 1990 due to a lack of self-sufficiency in the UK. The NHS' attitude towards these risky imports was described by Langstaff as one of "denial," stating that they should never have been distributed given their known risks and the availability of safer alternatives for bleeding disorders. 

Lastly, doctors were found to have authorized contaminated blood transfusions unnecessarily, particularly for women after childbirth, contributing to the overall complacency around blood safety measures. Between 80 and 100 people contracted HIV through these unnecessary procedures, while a staggering 26,800 individuals were infected with hepatitis C.
