评级机构声称，在涉及 777 的降级争议中，“生命线”面临风险。

## 摘要：
本文关注信用评级机构 **AM Best** 与两家美国保险公司大西洋海岸人寿保险（Atlantic Coast Life Insurance）和哨兵安全人寿保险（Sentinel Security Life Insurance，A-Cap集团的一部分）之间正在进行的法律纠纷。冲突的起因是 AM Best 由于这两家保险公司对埃弗顿足球俱乐部竞标者 777 Partners 的风险敞口而下调了其信用评级。

AM Best 认为，如果被禁止发布关于保险公司财务实力的意见（即使这些意见是负面的），其公信力将受到影响。这两家美国保险公司指控 AM Best 在其降级过程中使用了“有缺陷的方法、不适当的假设和明显错误的数据”。

在美监管机构的压力下，A-Cap 集团一直在试图减少对 777 Partners 的风险敞口。然而，如果保单持有人突然提出大量索赔，这一过程会因流动性差且难以变现的资产而变得复杂化。A-Cap 曾承诺筹集3亿美元的必要资本，但未能做到。

这两家保险公司已提起诉讼，要求法院阻止 AM Best 发布评级并强制其重新计算，而 AM Best 则坚称其评级基于可信证据和行业数据。这一纠纷导致其他潜在的再保险合作伙伴因诉讼风险暂停与A-Cap集团的谈判。

## 有趣的问题：
1. **AM Best 与这两家美国保险公司之间的法律争端如何影响信用评级机构的总体公信力？**
   如果发现 AM Best 使用有缺陷的方法或错误数据，可能会损害其自身以及其他信用评级机构的声誉。另一方面，如果法院支持 AM Best 的方法论和结论，可能会增强人们对其评级系统的信任。

2. **保险公司可以采取哪些措施来减轻流动性差资产带来的风险？**
   保险公司可以实施多种风险管理策略来降低风险，包括在不同资产类别和行业中分散投资、在进入再保险安排或收购新资产之前进行尽职调查、制定应急流动性危机计划以及维持足够的资本储备以覆盖潜在损失。

3. **这一法律纠纷的结果将如何影响监管机构针对高风险投资敞口显著保险公司采取的未来行动？**
   如果法院支持 AM Best 的降级决定，这可能表明监管机构对面临风险或流动性差资产敞口的保险公司采取了更严格的态度。这可能会导致对此类公司实施更加严格的监督和资本要求，以保护保单持有人并维护行业金融稳定。相反，如果 AM Best 的评级被认为不公平或基于有缺陷的数据，监管机构可能重新考虑在评估保险公司风险状况时对信用评级机构的依赖。

## Summary:
The article focusebs on an ongoing legal dispute between rating agency **AM Best** and two US insurers, Atlantic Coast Life Insurance and Sentinel Security Life Insurance (part of A-Cap Group). The conflict arose when AM Best downgraded the creditworthiness of these insurers due to their exposure to Everton football club bidder 777 Partners.

AM Best argues that its credibility is at stake if it's prevented from publishing opinions on an insurer’s financial strength, even when those opinions are negative. The two US insurers accused AM Best of using "flawed methods, improper assumptions, and demonstrably false data" in their downgrades.

A-Cap Group has been trying to reduce its exposure to 777 Partners under pressure from US regulators. However, the process is complicated by illiquid assets that are difficult to liquidate if there's a rush of claims by policyholders. A-Cap had promised to raise $300 million in needed capital but failed to do so.

The insurers have filed a lawsuit asking the court to stop AM Best from issuing the rating and force it to recalculate, while AM Best maintains that its ratings are based on credible evidence and industry data. The dispute has led to other potential reinsurance partners pausing talks with A-Cap due to litigation risks.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How does the legal battle between AM Best and the two US insurers impact the credibility of rating agencies in general?
A: The dispute highlights the importance of transparency, accuracy, and fairness in credit ratings provided by rating agencies like AM Best. If AM Best is found to have used flawed methods or false data, it could damage its reputation and that of other rating agencies as well. On the other hand, if AM Best's methodology and conclusions are upheld, it may reinforce trust in their ratings system.
2. Q: What measures can be taken by insurers to mitigate risks associated with exposure to illiquid assets?
A: Insurers can implement various risk management strategies such as diversifying investments across different asset classes and industries, conducting thorough due diligence before entering into reinsurance arrangements or acquiring new assets, setting up contingency plans for liquidity crises, and maintaining adequate capital reserves to cover potential losses.
3. Q: How might the outcome of this legal dispute influence future regulatory actions against insurers with significant exposure to high-risk investments?
A: If AM Best's downgrades are upheld by the court, it could signal a more stringent approach from regulators towards insurers exposed to risky or illiquid assets. This may lead to increased scrutiny and stricter capital requirements for such companies in order to protect policyholders and maintain financial stability within the industry. Conversely, if AM Best's ratings are deemed unfair or based on flawed data, regulators might reconsider their reliance on rating agencies when assessing insurers' risk profiles.
