# **越南**承诺增加能源供应，以应对愈发激烈的芯片竞赛 

**越南**正采取措施，为其蓬勃发展的**技术**和**芯片**产业确保**能源供应**，尤其聚焦于与**马来西亚**和**印度**等区域对手竞争，吸引**半导体**投资。该国计划投资部副部长**陈大勇**强调，必须迅速采取行动，通过各种激励措施吸引芯片投资者，如提供**税收优惠**、**研究资金**和**基础设施发展**，尤其是**电力生产**方面。鉴于该行业对断电的敏感性，越南正着力解决电力短缺问题，并增加**能源项目**，包括一个位于越南北部的500兆瓦项目，该区域是芯片投资的热点地区。 

该国还投资于**教育**和**培训**以支持该行业，并与36所大学合作，培养至少5万名工程师。越南计划建立四个**芯片研究中心**，并考虑额外的**税收激励政策**，以吸引该领域的外资。随着企业因地缘政治紧张局势和供应链中断而寻求在中国以外的地区实现生产多元化，越南的这些举措变得尤为重要。越南已拥有数十家芯片公司，包括英特尔最大的测试和装配厂，并正致力于超越基础制造业。该国确保能源供应和吸引芯片投资的努力表明其致力于成为全球芯片行业的主要参与者。
