民主党人考虑不可思议的事情：将乔·拜登搁在一边

**民主党考虑替换乔·拜登的可能性，因为他在与唐纳德·特朗普的辩论中表现不佳，这引起了该党内部的恐慌。然而，没有一个明确的替代候选人能够团结分裂的民主党并有效地对抗特朗普。由于他们亲密的关系，第一夫人卡玛拉·哈里斯被认为有可能说服拜登让位。**

**要点：**
- 民主党正在考虑在乔·拜登与唐纳德·特朗普的灾难性辩论后替换他的可能性。
- 没有一个明确的替代候选人能够团结该党并有效地对抗特朗普。
- 第一夫人卡玛拉·哈里斯可能由于她与拜登亲密的关系而说服他让位。
- 替换拜登可能会疏远民主党联盟的核心部分，因为他们跳过了一位黑人副总统而选择了一个白人候选人。
- 其他潜在候选人缺乏全国性的吸引力或记录来说服捐赠者写下必要的支票。

**其他信息：**
- 乔·拜登的政治故事是复原力的故事，他多次被低估，但总是能够东山再起。
- 上一次总统自愿让位是在理查德·尼克松在水门丑闻期间。
- 一批年轻的民主党候选人一直在等待机会接替拜登，密歇根州广受欢迎的州长格雷琴·惠特默是其中一位潜在候选人。

 **Summary:**
Democrats are considering the possibility of replacing President Joe Biden after his poor debate performance against Donald Trump, which has caused panic within the party. However, there is no clear alternative candidate who could unite a divided Democratic Party and mount an effective campaign against Trump. The first lady, Kamala Harris, is seen as potentially capable of persuading Biden to step aside due to their close relationship.

**Key Points:**
- Democrats are contemplating replacing Joe Biden after his disastrous debate performance with Donald Trump.
- There is no clear alternative candidate who could unite the party and mount an effective campaign against Trump.
- The first lady, Kamala Harris, may be able to persuade Biden to step aside due to their close relationship.
- A potential replacement for Biden would risk alienating a core part of the Democratic coalition by passing over a Black vice-president for a white candidate.
- Other potential candidates lack national appeal or record to convince donors to write necessary cheques.

**Additional Information:**
- Joe Biden's political story is one of resilience, having been counted out multiple times but always managing to recover.
- The last time a president voluntarily stepped aside was in 1amo Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.
- A younger group of Democratic candidates has been waiting for an opportunity to succeed Biden, with Gretchen Whitmer, the popular Michigan governor, being one potential candidate.
