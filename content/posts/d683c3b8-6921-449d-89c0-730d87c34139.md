# **唐纳德·特朗普** 认为婚外情曝光会影响选举，前 “搞定者” **迈克尔·科恩** 说

**唐纳德·特朗普** 的前 “搞定者” 和律师 **迈克尔·科恩** 称，特朗普认为与成人电影演员 **斯托米·丹尼尔斯**（Stormy Daniels）的 **婚外情** 曝光会对他的 2016 年总统竞选造成潜在的 “灾难性” 影响。科恩的证词意义重大，因为它 **强化了检察官的说法**，即 “封口费” 支付被用于影响选举。科恩本人已成为特朗普的激烈反对者，他在审判中是一名 **关键证人**，他承认策划了 “抓捕和杀害” 计划来掩盖负面消息。他回忆说，特朗普担心失去女性选民的支持，并命令科恩压制这一消息。科恩的证词还提供了偿还款项背后会计安排的细节，这与辩护方的主张相矛盾。科恩曾一度是特朗普最亲密的助手之一，后来他公开批评他的前雇主，称他为 “黑帮分子”。检察官依靠科恩的证词来佐证其他证人的说法，包括斯托米·丹尼尔斯的说法。审判仍在继续，特朗普表示他可能会出庭为自己辩护。特朗普继续谴责此案是 “政治猎巫”。

科恩本人也有不光彩的过去，他用 13 万美元的个人资金 **买断了丹尼尔斯的沉默**，做出这一决定是因为听到她威胁要公开与特朗普所谓的性遭遇。科恩的行为动机是为了取悦他的 “老板”，他承认经常在特朗普授意下说谎和欺凌。尽管他们曾经亲密无间，但科恩和特朗普后来公开互相辱骂，科恩因多项联邦罪名入狱，特朗普则面临纽约州的刑事指控。

# Donald Trump saw affair story as election 'disaster', ex-fixer Michael Cohen says

Michael Cohen, **Donald Trump**'s former fixer and attorney, testified that Trump viewed revelations of an **extramarital encounter** with adult film actor **Stormy Daniels** as a potential "disaster" for his 2016 presidential campaign. Cohen's testimony is significant as it **bolsters prosecutors' claims** that "hush money" payments were used to influence the election. Cohen, who has become a bitter opponent of Trump, is a **crucial witness** in the trial, having admitted to orchestrating a "catch and kill" scheme to bury negative stories. He recalled Trump's worries about losing support from women voters and ordered Cohen to suppress the story. Cohen's testimony also provided details of the accounting arrangements behind the repayments, contradicting the defense's claims. Cohen, once one of Trump's closest aides, has since publicly criticized his former employer, calling him a "mobster." Prosecutors relied on Cohen's testimony to corroborate other witnesses' accounts, including that of Stormy Daniels. The trial continues, with Trump indicating he may testify in his defense. Trump continues to denounce the case as a "political witch hunt."

/n/n

Cohen, who has a **chequered past** himself, used $130,000 of his own money to **buy Daniels' silence**, a decision that was made after hearing her threat to go public with the story of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Cohen's actions were driven by a desire to please his "boss," and he admitted to frequently lying and bullying on Trump's behalf. Despite their former closeness, Cohen and Trump have since publicly traded insults, with Cohen serving prison time for various federal charges and Trump facing criminal charges in New York.
