捷克政党在欧盟议会对埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的团体造成打击

# 捷克ANO党的离开对埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的中间派集团是一个打击，并巩固了乔治娅·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）的极右翼保守派作为第三大党团。

由于认为其亲欧政策压制了小国的身份和文化，由前欧洲怀疑论者总理安德烈·巴比什（Andrej Babiš）领导的ANO党离开了Renew Europe。这一举动使Renew与欧洲保守派和改革主义者（ECR）集团之间的差距扩大到了九个席位。

作为欧洲第三大政治力量的领袖，梅洛尼要求在谈判欧盟顶级职位和制定立法议程时有座位。马克龙和其他领导人迄今为止都忽视了她，但正在接近最终确定乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）的第二个任期作为委员会主席，并选择安东尼奥·科斯塔（António Costa）作为欧洲理事会主席，而梅洛尼则基于意识形态差异反对后者。

最近几个月，ANO和Renew的关系恶化，导致这种分离。Renew的议会领袖瓦莱里·哈耶（Valérie Hayer）表示，由于他们的民粹主义道路与Renew的价值观不兼容，ANO的离开“早就应该发生了”。

巴比什排除了加入ECR的可能性，并可能与匈牙利总理维克多·奥班（Viktor Orbán）组成伙伴关系，他不属于任何集团。然而，他们需要五个国家的政党才能在7月15日之前形成一个新的集团。

 **Summary of Article:**  
The Czech ANO party's departure from Renew Europe deals a blow to Emmanuel Macron’s centrist group in the European Parliament and consolidates Giorgia Meloni’s ultraconservatives as the third-largest caucus. The ANO party, led by former Eurosceptic Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, left Renew Europe due to its pro-European policies that they believe suppress small states' identities and cultures. This move has widened the gap between Renew and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, now at nine seats in the amo assembly.

Giorgia Meloni, leader of Europe’s third-largebest political force, demands a seat at the table for negotiating EU's top jobs and setting legislative agendas. Macron and other leaders have snubbed her so far but are close to finalizing Ursula von der Leyen's second term as commission president and selecting António Costa as European Council President, with Meloni opposing the latter choice on grounds of ideological differences.

The relationship between ANO and Renew had deteriorated in recent months, leading to this separation. Valérie Hayer, Renew’s parliamentary leader, stated that ANO's departure was "long overdue" due to their populist path being incompatible with Renew's values.

Babiš has ruled out joining the ECR and could potentially form a partnership with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is not affiliated with any group. However, they would need parties from five more countries to form a new group by July 15th.
