# **阿根廷**发行首款面值10,000比索的钞票以应对**通货膨胀**

**阿根廷**推出了首款面值10,000比索的钞票，价值约11美元，以应对**严重通货膨胀**及其造成的繁琐现金交易问题。此举旨在简化大额现金的使用，自**比索**价值暴跌以来，这一直是一个挑战。新钞票的面值较之前的最大面额2,000比索和1,000比索有了大幅提升，在该国艰难的经济形势下，这些面额已无法满足日常交易需求。

由于**经济不稳定**以及零售商希望立即获得资金（其中一些经营**不在账簿上**），现金仍是阿根廷首选的支付方式。央行的决定旨在为公众简化交易，降低与金融体系物流相关的成本。目前，阿根廷正陷入严重的经济危机，3月份年通胀率高达287%，比索价值在过去五年中贬值95%。

去年12月上任的总统**哈维尔·米莱**认为，该国经济困境的原因在于前政府过度依赖**印钞**来资助支出。虽然米莱实施了**紧缩政策**来遏制这种为财政赤字融资的做法，但央行仍通过印钞来偿付短期债务利息。为了不鼓励当地银行持有这些短期债券，央行将基准利率从133%大幅下调至50%，远低于通胀率。

这些努力已显现成效，月通胀率从12月的26%降至3月的11%，预计4月份将达到个位数。10,000比索面额的钞票在中国印刷，因为阿根廷造币厂无法满足激增的现金需求。随着流通中的1,000比索钞票数量在过去一年翻了一番，央行计划在2023年底前发行面额20,000比索的钞票，以进一步促进在艰难经济环境下的交易。

# Sky-high inflation forces Argentina to circulate first 10,000-peso notes 

**Argentina** has introduced its first 10,000-peso notes, worth approximately $11, to combat the effects of **hyperinflation** and the resulting cumbersome cash transactions. This move aims to streamline the use of large amounts of cash, which has been a challenge since the **peso's** value plummeted. The new notes are a significant increase in value from the previous largest denominations of 2,000 and 1,000 pesos, which were insufficient for daily transactions in the country's struggling economy. 

/n/n

Cash remains a preferred payment method in Argentina due to **economic instability** and a preference for immediate funds among retailers, some of whom operate **off the books**. The central bank's decision is intended to make transactions easier for the public and reduce the costs associated with the financial system's logistics. This step comes as Argentina grapples with a severe economic crisis, reflected in a staggering 287% annual inflation rate in March and a 95% loss in the peso's value over five years. 

/n/n

President **Javier Milei**, who assumed office in December, attributes the country's economic woes to previous administrations' reliance on **money printing** to fund spending. While Milei has implemented **austerity measures** to curb this practice for financing the primary fiscal deficit, the central bank still resorts to money printing to service short-term debt interest. To discourage local banks from holding these short-term notes, the bank has slashed its benchmark interest rate from 133% to 50%, well below the inflation rate. 

/n/n

There are signs that these efforts are yielding results, with the monthly inflation rate dropping from 26% in December to 11% in March, and predictions of single-digit inflation for April. The 10,000-peso notes were printed in **China**, as Argentina's mint struggles to keep up with the surging demand for cash. With the number of 1,000-peso bills in circulation doubling in the past year, the central bank plans to introduce a 20,000-peso note by the end of 2023 to further facilitate transactions in the challenging economic climate.
