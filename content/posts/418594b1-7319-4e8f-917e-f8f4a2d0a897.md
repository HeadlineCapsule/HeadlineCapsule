# 从另一个纽约维度重新想象赞比亚的重组

**赞比亚漫长的债务重组过程**引发了人们对如何改进该过程以及政府破产的国际框架是否有效的思考。纽约提出的《主权债务稳定法案》旨在解决这些问题，但尚不清楚这是否会加快赞比亚的重组进程或提高其效率。本摘要探索了拟议的纽约立法可能对赞比亚债务重组过程产生何种影响。

假设新立法已经到位，赞比亚的债券受纽约法律管辖，该国将不得不应对一个复杂且可能充满挫折的过程。在任命“独立监督人”后，赞比亚必须提供通知并认证某些条件以启动重组。然而，债权人可能会质疑赞比亚认证的有效性，导致昂贵的诉讼。

这一过程包括通过谈判和磋商制定重组计划，在本案中，该计划得到了债券持有人的批准。同时，赞比亚必须与其他债权人进行谈判，例如20国集团共同框架下的政府。尽管达成了协议，但国际货币基金组织（IMF）和官方债权人委员会（OCC）宣布，债券持有人的协议与他们的评估不兼容，从而造成了进一步的挑战。

然后，赞比亚探索了 **第230条索赔** 的选择，这涉及根据20国集团共同框架等国际倡议限制债权人的追回额。然而，由于官方债权人委员会拒绝披露其协议条款，他们面临着障碍，这阻止了赞比亚满足“强有力的披露标准”。

总之，尽管拟议的纽约立法旨在改善主权债务重组，但它增加了该过程的复杂性和不确定性。赞比亚的案例说明了协调不同债权人和评估方面所面临的挑战，突出了建立一个更简化和有效的国际框架的必要性。

# Reimagining Zambia’s Restructuring in an Alternative New York Dimension 

**Zambia's lengthy debt restructuring process** has prompted reflections on how it could have been improved and whether the international framework for government bankruptcies is effective. The proposed "Sovereign Debt Stability Act" in New York aims to address these issues, but it's unclear if it would have made Zambia's journey quicker or more efficient. This summary explores how the proposed New York legislation might have impacted Zambia's debt restructuring process. 

Assuming the new legislation was in place and Zambia's bonds were governed by New York law, the country would have had to navigate a complex process with potential setbacks. After appointing an "independent monitor," Zambia would have had to provide notice and certify certain conditions to initiate the restructuring. However, creditors could have challenged the validity of Zambia's certification, leading to costly litigation. 

The process continues with negotiations and consultations to develop a restructuring plan, which, in this case, was approved by bondholders. Simultaneously, Zambia had to negotiate with other creditors, such as governments under the G20 Common Framework. Despite reaching agreements, the IMF and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) declared that the bondholder deal wasn't compatible with their assessments, creating further challenges. 

Zambia then explored the option of a **Section 230 Claim**, which involves limiting creditor recoveries based on an international initiative like the G20 Common Framework. However, they faced obstacles due to the OCC's refusal to disclose the terms of their deal, preventing Zambia from meeting the required "robust disclosure standards." 

In conclusion, while the proposed New York legislation aims to improve sovereign debt restructuring, it adds complexity and uncertainty to the process. The case of Zambia illustrates the challenges of navigating different creditor groups and assessments, highlighting the need for a more streamlined and effective international framework.
