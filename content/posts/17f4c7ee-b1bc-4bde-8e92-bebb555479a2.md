# 英国制定人工智能模型创作培训规则

**英国部长们**正着手解决该国**创意产业**的担忧，计划提高**透明度**，规范**科技公司**在**人工智能模型**培训中使用其作品的情况。文化大臣**露西·弗雷泽**表示，政府将把透明度作为优先事项，确保**人工智能**开发人员在训练模型时使用的内容对版权持有人可见，以便他们识别潜在的知识产权侵权行为。随着音乐、电影和出版行业的艺术家和高层担心未经许可或报酬便使用他们的作品，这一举措变得尤为重要。

英国政府正在努力实现促进本国人工智能产业和保护创意产业这两个双重目标，即将到来的大选进一步增加了问题的复杂性。弗雷泽承认了这个问题很复杂，强调需要一个充满活力的监管环境。她还重点提到了选择加入和退出选项以及内容创作者得到报酬的重要性。政府计划在大选前提出提案，尽管具体的透明度保障机制还有待确定。

欧盟已经在《**人工智能法案**》下引入了类似的规则，要求详细披露培训内容并遵守版权法。相比之下，英国在实施监管方面行动较慢，承认在吸引人工智能公司的同时防止创意作品被滥用的挑战。去年，版权持有人和人工智能开发人员在自愿制定规则方面的尝试没有成功。英国即将提出的提案旨在解决这些问题，并为人工智能模型培训中对创意内容的使用建立一个平衡的框架。

# UK Working on Rules for Training of AI Models with Creative Work 

**UK ministers** are addressing concerns of the country's **creative industries** by developing plans to increase **transparency** regarding the use of their work by **tech companies** in training **AI models**. Culture Secretary **Lucy Frazer** has stated that the government will prioritize transparency, ensuring that content used by AI developers to train their models is visible to rights holders, enabling them to identify potential intellectual property infringement. This move comes as artists and executives in music, film, and publishing worry about their work being used without permission or remuneration. 

The UK government is navigating the dual goals of fostering the nation's AI sector and protecting its creative industries, a challenge further complicated by the upcoming general election. Frazer acknowledged the complexity of the issue, emphasizing the need for a dynamic regulatory environment. She also highlighted the importance of opt-in and opt-out options and remuneration for content creators. The government aims to bring forward proposals before the expected autumn election, though specific mechanisms for ensuring transparency are yet to be determined. 

The EU is already introducing similar rules under its **AI Act**, requiring detailed disclosures of training content and compliance with copyright law. In contrast, the UK has been slower to implement regulations, acknowledging the challenge of attracting AI companies while preventing the exploitation of creative works. This follows an unsuccessful attempt at creating voluntary rules between rights holders and AI developers last year. The UK's upcoming proposals aim to address these concerns and establish a balanced framework for the use of creative content in AI model training.
