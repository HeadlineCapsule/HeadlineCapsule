# 随着通胀下降和预期中的降息，美元涨势受阻 

**随着投资者预期通胀下降和潜在的降息，美元涨势出现逆转**。美元在今年早些时候曾升值 5%，但现在受周三关键通胀数据发布的影响，预计将出现月度下跌。市场情绪的这一转变导致投资者重新评估他们对利率走势的预期。最初人们担心通胀上升和随之而来的加息，现在却转为期待降息，美联储的行动成为市场关注的焦点。 

**美国银行的 Athanasios Vamvakidis** 强调了美联储定价的重要性，表示最近的通胀数据消除了再次加息的可能性。其他分析师也持相同观点，他们预测美元可能走弱，投资者立场将发生转变。美元的表现也与美国政府的借贷成本走势有关，最近借贷成本下降推动美国、德国和英国的股市创下新高。 

**基准 10 年期美国国债收益率**（对全球资产定价至关重要）已下降至 4.3%，反映出市场更加期待美联储降息。对冲基金开始做空美元，而资产管理公司则保持超配美元头寸，这表明其策略可能出现分歧。美元走弱为全球央行（尤其是日本央行）提供了喘息机会，日本央行曾进行干预以支持日元。 

**荷兰国际集团和银行美林的策略师** 分别强调了不断变化的利率预期对日元的影响以及对欧元区货币政策的影响。美联储降息的可能性减少了欧洲中央银行（ECB）维持利率差的压力，使得欧元区有可能在6月降息，而不会对欧元造成重大负面影响。 

总的来说，通胀下降和预期的降息打乱了美元的涨势，这可能标志着其今年表现中的转折点。该货币的走势将继续受到经济数据和主要央行行动的影响。

# Dollar Rally Falters as Falling Inflation Raises Hopes of Rate Cuts 

**The US dollar's rally experiences a reversal as investors anticipate falling inflation and potential interest rate cuts**. The dollar, which had appreciated by 5% earlier this year, is now on track for a monthly decline, influenced by a key inflation data release on Wednesday. This shift in market sentiment has led investors to reevaluate their expectations for interest rate trajectories. The initial concerns about rising inflation and subsequent rate hikes have now transitioned into hopes for rate cuts, with the Federal Reserve's actions being a key focus for markets. 

**Athanasios Vamvakidis of Bank of America** emphasizes the significance of Fed pricing, stating that the recent inflation data eliminates the possibility of another rate hike. This sentiment is echoed by other analysts, who predict a potential weakening of the dollar and a shift in investor positioning. The dollar's performance is also linked to the movement of US government borrowing costs, with a recent decline contributing to record highs in stock markets across the US, Germany, and the UK. 

**The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield**, a pivotal factor in global asset pricing, has decreased to 4.3%, reflecting increased expectations for Fed rate cuts. Hedge funds have begun to build short positions against the dollar, while asset managers maintain their overweight positions, indicating a potential strategic divergence. The dollar's weakening provides a respite for global central bankers, especially in Japan, where interventions have been made to support the yen. 

**Strategists at ING and Bank of America** highlight the impact of shifting rate expectations on the Japanese yen and the eurozone's monetary policy, respectively. The potential for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve eases pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain rate differentials, allowing for a potential rate cut in June without significant negative consequences for the euro. 

Overall, the falling inflation and the anticipated rate cuts have disrupted the dollar's rally, potentially signaling a turning point in its performance for the year. The currency's movement will continue to be influenced by economic data and the actions of major central banks.
