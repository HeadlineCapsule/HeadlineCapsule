# 沃灵顿市议会拒绝向审计师提供关键信息

**沃灵顿市议会** 拒绝向其审计师 **格兰特·索顿** 提供关键财务信息，阻碍了他们审查该负债累累的市议会账目的能力。 此时，市议会正因激进的借贷和投资策略受到越来越多的监督，其债务已接近 20 亿英镑。 **英国政府** 已任命一名监察员调查市议会是否遵守“最佳价值”要求，因为其审计年度账目严重拖延。 **格兰特·索顿** 的近期报告称，由于市议会在 **向太阳能农场贷款 8,700 万英镑** 的状态方面缺乏透明度，审计工作面临“重大挑战”。 这导致产生了 **经修订的审计意见**，并引发了人们对市议会财务管理和透明度的担忧。

沃灵顿总计 15 亿英镑的投资包括对失败企业的有价证券和争议性交易，例如与 **摩纳哥对冲基金经理李·罗宾逊** 有关的投资。 **格兰特·索顿** 的审计报告强调，对 **红杉银行** 控股公司的 3,000 万英镑的投资被严重高估，随后被减记。 市议会为自己的行为辩护，称即将发布 2023/24 年度草案账目，并提到地方政府由于普遍存在的问题而在审计中面临挑战。 然而，审计员的调查结果和政府的干预表明了局势的严峻性，以及沃灵顿市议会改善财务管理和提高透明度的必要性。

# Warrington Council Refused to Hand Over Key Information to Auditor

**Warrington Borough Council** withheld crucial financial information from its auditor, **Grant Thornton**, hindering their ability to review the heavily indebted council's accounts. This refusal comes amidst increasing scrutiny of the council's aggressive borrowing and investment strategies, which have seen it accumulate nearly £2 billion in debt. The **UK government** has appointed an inspector to investigate the council's compliance with "best value" requirements, as its audited annual accounts are significantly delayed. **Grant Thornton's** recent report described the audit as a "major challenge" due to the council's lack of transparency regarding the status of **£87 million in loans to solar farms**. This has resulted in a **modified audit opinion** and raised concerns about the council's financial management and transparency.

Warrington's investments, totaling £1.5 billion, have included stakes in failed businesses and controversial deals, such as investments linked to **Monaco-based hedge fund manager Lee Robinson**. **Grant Thornton's** audit report highlighted a £30 million stake in **Redwood Bank's** holding company, which was significantly overvalued and subsequently written down. The council has defended its actions, citing the upcoming release of its draft accounts for 2023/24 and the challenges faced by local governments in auditing due to widespread issues. However, the auditor's findings and the government's intervention underscore the seriousness of the situation and the need for improved financial management and transparency at Warrington Council.
