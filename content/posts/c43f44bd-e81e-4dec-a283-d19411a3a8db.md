# 娜塔莉·埃尔菲克从保守党转投工党，对里希·苏纳克再度造成打击

英国首相 **里希·苏纳克** （Rishi Sunak）遭遇打击，因为代表多佛尔的保守党议员 **娜塔莉·埃尔菲克** （Natalie Elphicke）转投 **工党** （Labour Party）。这是两周内第二位保守党议员转投工党，削弱了苏纳克在地方选举失利后团结保守党议员的努力。埃尔菲克此举的原因是苏纳克领导的“混乱政府”的“违背承诺”。她的转投引发了人们对工党领袖 **基尔·斯塔默** （Keir Starmer）判断的质疑，因为埃尔菲克有被议会暂停职务的历史，还曾受到一名高级法官的批评。埃尔菲克取代了其前夫 **查理·埃尔菲克** （Charlie Elphicke）的职位，后者因性侵罪被判入狱。她对前夫定罪的回应以及试图影响审判法官的做法曾受到批评。尽管一些工党议员反对，但斯塔默仍对埃尔菲克的转投表示欢迎，认为这是保守党远离中间立场的证据。埃尔菲克的多佛尔多数优势及其住房方面的专业知识被视为资产，但她的决定激怒了保守党议员，并引发了人们对潜在交易或动机的质疑。这一事件还促使人们关注工党恢复议员 **凯特·奥萨莫尔** （Kate Osamor）的党鞭职务，后者曾因社交媒体上的争议性帖文被暂停议员资格，有人认为此举是为了讨好工党左翼。苏纳克的发言人强调了埃尔菲克此前对工党移民政策的批评，暗示了可能的攻击路线。

# Tory MP Natalie Elphicke Defects to Labour in Fresh Blow to Rishi Sunak 

**Rishi Sunak**, the British Prime Minister, suffered a blow as **Natalie Elphicke**, the **Conservative MP** for Dover, defected to the **Labour Party**. This is the second Conservative MP defection to Labour in as many weeks, undermining Sunak's efforts to rally Tory MPs after their poor performance in local elections. Elphicke's move was motivated by "broken promises" from Sunak's "chaotic government". Her defection triggered questions about Labour leader **Keir Starmer's** judgment due to Elphicke's political history, including her suspension from parliament and criticism from a senior judge. Elphicke replaced her former husband, **Charlie Elphicke**, who was convicted of sexual assault. She faced criticism for her response to his conviction and for attempting to influence the trial judge. Despite opposition from some Labour MPs, Starmer welcomed the defection as evidence of the Conservative Party moving away from the center ground. Elphicke's majority in Dover and her housing expertise are seen as assets, but her decision angered Tory MPs and raised questions about potential deals or motivations. This event also brought attention to Labour's reinstatement of the whip to **Kate Osamor**, an MP suspended for controversial social media posts, which some saw as an attempt to appease the left wing of the party. Sunak's spokesperson highlighted Elphicke's previous criticism of Labour's migration policy, indicating a potential line of attack.
