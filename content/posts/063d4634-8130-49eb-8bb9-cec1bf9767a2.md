美国最高法院支持在家庭暴力案件中禁止持枪

**美国最高法院维持对家庭暴力案件的枪支禁令**

美国最高法院维持了对受到家庭暴力限制令的人拥有枪支的限制，裁定禁止威胁他人安全的人拥有枪支并不违反《第二修正案》。法院在*美国诉拉希米*案中以8-1的多数裁定，对身体安全构成可信威胁的个人可以根据《第二修正案》暂时解除武装，首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨（John Roberts）如是说。

在做出这一裁决之前，枪支权利倡导者取得了之前的胜利，包括推翻了对“弹簧枪”的禁令，并推翻了纽约州的一项法律，该法律要求个人必须证明“正当理由”才能公开携带隐蔽枪支。此案涉及扎基·拉希米（Zackey Rahimi），他违反了暂停其枪支许可证两年的限制令，此前他涉嫌袭击女友并用枪威胁另一名妇女。

托马斯大法官（Justice Clarence Thomas）对周五的裁决表示异议，批评该禁令的“广泛范围和缺乏程序”，而索托马耶尔大法官（Justice Sonia Sotomayor）提出了 đồng意意见，称赞多数意见的解释比托马斯对案例法的严格方法更有用。

美国司法部长梅里克·加兰（Merrick Garland）称赞法院的裁决，称其“通过禁止危险个人拥有枪支，保护了受害者，这些个人对其亲密伴侣和孩子构成了威胁”。

 **US Supreme Court Upholds Gun Ban in Domestic Abuse Cases**

The US Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on the possession of firearms by people under domestic violence restraining orders, ruling that barring individuals who threaten others' safety from keeping firearms does not violate the Second Amendment. The court’s 8-1 majority in *US vs Rahimi* found that an individual posing a credible threat to physical safety may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amamoent, as stated by Chief Justice John Roberts.

The ruling comes after previous victories for gun rights advocates, including overturning a ban on "bump stocks" and striking down a New York state law requiring individuals to show "proper cause" to carry concealed guns in public. The case at the heart of this decision involved Zackey Rahimi, who violated a restraining order that suspended his gun license for two years after allegedly assaulting his then-girlfriend and threatening another woman with a firearm.

Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from Friday's decision, criticizing the ban’s "broad scope and lack of process," while Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered a concurring opinion that praised the majority's interpretation as more useful than Thomas's strict approach to case law.

US Attorney-General Merrick Garland commended the court's decision, stating that it "protects victims by keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals who pose a threat to their intimate partners and children."
