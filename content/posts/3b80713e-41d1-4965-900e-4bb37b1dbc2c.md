# **黑岩** 即将成为全球最大的比特币基金管理者

**黑岩**（BlackRock），这家总部位于美国的资产管理巨头，正迅速接近成为全球最大的**比特币基金**管理公司的目标，这标志着该公司从最初对此的怀疑到现在的重大转变。该公司最近推出的**实物比特币交易型开放式指数基金（ETF）**在短短四个月内就吸引了高达167亿美元的资产，与当前市场领先者**灰度**公司（Grayscale）的资产规模仅相差不到10亿美元。这要归功于客户兴趣的日益增长和数字资产的快速发展。黑岩进入加密货币领域的举措是经过战略性谋划的，重点是将机构级的质量带入这个生态系统。该公司还推出了发展最快的**代币化国库基金**之一，该基金在加密对冲基金和做市商中越来越受欢迎。这一举措，加上其对**Circle**和**Securitize**的投资，凸显了黑岩对数字资产市场日益增长的信心。该公司在**以太坊**区块链上推出的名为“**Buidl**”的代币化国库基金，已经超越竞争对手，吸引了3.82亿美元的资金。黑岩进入加密货币市场为投资者注入了活力，并加速了该行业的发展，预计该公司将凭借其专业知识和规模为这一领域带来进一步的合法性和创新。

此外，黑岩在加密领域的参与不仅限于其基金。该公司对 Circle（一家稳定币运营商）和 Securitize（一个利用数字代币代表资产的平台）进行了战略投资。这些举措凸显了黑岩致力于为加密市场带来机构级的质量和稳定性。凭借其规模和专业知识，黑岩有望在塑造数字资产的未来和推动其广泛采用方面发挥关键作用。该公司的参与也为加密领域增添了一层可信度，这可能吸引更多的机构投资者。随着行业的发展，人们将密切关注黑岩对加密货币市场的影响力和影响。

# BlackRock closes in on crown of world's largest bitcoin fund 

**BlackRock**, the US asset management giant, is rapidly closing in on becoming the world's largest **bitcoin fund** manager, marking a significant shift from its initial skepticism. The company's recently launched **spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)** has amassed an impressive $16.7 billion in assets in just four months, trailing the current market leader, **Grayscale**, by less than $1 billion.

The company has also launched the fastest-growing **tokenized Treasury fund**, which is gaining traction among crypto hedge funds and market makers. This move, along with its investments in **Circle** and **Securitize**, underscores BlackRock's growing confidence in the digital assets market. The company's **Buidl** fund, a tokenized Treasury fund on the **Ethereum** blockchain, has already overtaken rivals, attracting $382 million. BlackRock's presence in the crypto market has energized investors and accelerated the industry's evolution, with the company's expertise and scale expected to drive further legitimacy and innovation in the space.
