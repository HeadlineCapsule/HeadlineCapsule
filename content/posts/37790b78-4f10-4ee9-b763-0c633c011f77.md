# 托德·贝利的投资公司洽谈收购私募信贷公司

据报道，**美国金融家**托德·贝利（Todd Boehly) 的投资公司埃尔德里奇工业（Eldridge Industries）正在就收购欧洲私募信贷公司海芬资本管理公司（Hayfin Capital Management）进行**深入谈判**。该交易价值超过 10 亿欧元，将使埃尔德里奇工业能够进入向欧洲私人企业放贷的蓬勃市场。

海芬资本管理公司专注于**直接贷款**、**特殊机会**和**高收益信贷**，其**管理资产**超过 300 亿欧元。此次收购符合埃尔德里奇工业多元化的投资组合，包括保险、资产管理、科技、媒体和房地产投资。

此次潜在收购是贝利在体育特许经营权方面多项著名投资之一，包括近期以 42.5 亿英镑收购切尔西足球俱乐部以及共同拥有洛杉矶道奇队和洛杉矶湖人队。

私募信贷市场的增长据**国际货币基金组织**估计，全球私募信贷市场规模超过 2 万亿美元，这归因于银行在金融危机后不愿意放贷。这为贝恩资本和 KKR 这样的收购公司以及富兰克林·邓普顿等资产管理公司扩大其私募信贷业务创造了机会。

海芬资本管理公司由前高盛银行家于 2009 年创立，自 2017年被不列颠哥伦比亚省投资管理公司收购以来，其管理资产增长了四倍，员工人数扩大到超过 200 名员工，实现了显著增长。

随着埃尔德里奇工业与海芬资本管理公司谈判的深入，前者进入私募信贷领域以及对欧洲私人借贷格局的影响将值得关注。

# Todd Boehly’s investment house in advanced talks to buy private credit firm

**US financier** Todd Boehly's investment firm, Eldridge Industries, is reportedly in **advanced negotiations** to acquire Hayfin Capital Management, a European private credit company. The deal is valued at over €1 billion and would grant Eldridge Industries access to the thriving market of lending to private European enterprises. 

With **assets under management** exceeding €30 billion, Hayfin Capital Management specializes in **direct lending**, **special opportunities**, and **high-yield credit**. This acquisition aligns with Eldridge Industries' diverse portfolio, which includes insurance, asset management, technology, media, and real estate investments. 

The potential acquisition builds upon Boehly's notable investments in sports franchises, including the recent high-profile purchase of Chelsea Football Club for £4.25 billion and his co-ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the LA Lakers. 

The growth of the private credit market, estimated at over $2 trillion globally by the IMF, is attributed to banks' reluctance to lend following the financial crisis. This has created opportunities for buyout firms like Blackstone and KKR, as well as asset managers such as Franklin Templeton, to expand their private credit operations. 

Hayfin Capital Management, founded in 2009 by former Goldman Sachs bankers, has experienced significant growth since its acquisition by British Columbia Investment Management Corporation in 2017, quadrupling its assets under management and expanding its team to over 200 employees worldwide. 

As Eldridge Industries and Hayfin Capital Management navigate these advanced discussions, the former's expansion into the private credit sector and the impact on the European private lending landscape bear watching.
