纽约拍卖会低迷 显示近期趋势逆转

全球艺术市场继续蓬勃发展：佳士得在伦敦举办**战后至今的艺术品现场销售**（6月27日），同时还将举行一场拍卖会，展示薇薇安·韦斯特伍德 (Vivienne Westwood) 的服装和配饰。苏富比现代及当代艺术晚拍将于 6 月

B: 佳士得在伦敦举办 **战后至今艺术品现场销售**（6月27日），同时将举行一场拍卖会，展示薇薇安·韦斯特伍德 (Vivienne Westwood) 的服装和配饰。苏富比现代及当代艺术晚拍将于6月25日举行，在线竞标时间为6月14日至28日。

伦敦老大师绘画经销商迪克森（Dickinson）正将业务扩展至雕塑领域，推出专门的展览“**生命的形式：意大利雕塑 1400-1800 年**”（6 月 17 日 - 7 月 18 日）。画廊创始人西蒙·迪克森 (Simon Dickinson) 的儿子兼总经理米洛·迪克森（Milo Dickinson）负责这一新类别。他之前在佳士得担任雕塑专家。

根据《巴塞尔艺术展/瑞银艺术市场报告》，雕塑仅占经销商 2023 年销售额的 12%，低于 2021 年的 16%。相比之下，绘画在这两年的销量分别占到了57%和64%。这种下降趋势可能是由于专家人员因退休或去世而减少，以及复制品和铸造日期复杂性的问题。

为了扩大雕塑的受众群体，米洛·迪克森建议展示美丽的作品并提供适当的解释。下个月举办的展览将展出13件作品，价格从20万美元到250万美元不等。最昂贵的作品是马西米利亚诺·索尔达尼·本齐 (Massimiliano Soldani Benzi) 的《基督哀悼》（约 1715 年）的**陶土雕塑**。

伦敦聚光灯画廊在伊比萨岛的圣米格尔·德巴拉沙开设了新空间，将展出三位艺术家的群展，直至6月20日，价格高达5万欧元。这个新场地提供地面和夹层画廊，以及一个庭院酒吧和餐厅，由画廊艺术家Tai Shani设计。聚光灯画廊是伊比萨岛CAN艺术博览会（6 月 26 日 - 30 日）的32家参展商之一。

在巴塞尔艺术展上，豪瑟沃斯画廊将展出英国画家乔治·鲁伊 (George Rouy) 的作品《**污迹与风景**](Stains on the Scenery)**》（2024 年，20万英镑）。自 2

B: The global art market continues to evolve with Christie's hosting a live sale of postwar-to-present art in London (June 27) alongside an auction featuring Vivienne Westwood's outfits and accessories. Sotheby’s Modern & Contemporary Evening Auction is set for June 25, with online bidding from June 14 to 28.

The London Old Masters paintings dealership Dickinson is expanding into sculpture with a dedicated exhibition titled "Forma Viva: Italian Sculpture 1400-1800" (June 17 - July 18). Milo Dickinson, the managing director and son of gallery founder Simon Dickinson, spearheads this new category. He previously worked as a sculpture specialist at Christie's.

Sculptures account for only 12% of dealer sales in 2023, down from 16% in 2021, according to the Art Basel/UBS Art Market Report. This is compared to paintings which make up 57% and 64% respectively during those years. The decline can be attributed to a lack of specialists due to retirements or deaths, as well as complexities surrounding reproductions and casting dates.

To widen the audience for sculptures, Milo Dickinson suggests showcasing beautiful pieces and providing proper explanations. Next month's exhibition will feature 13 works with prices ranging from $200,000 to $2.5 million. The most expensive piece is "The Lamentation of Christ" (c1715), a terracotta by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi.

London's Gathering gallery has opened in Ibiza at Sant Miquel de Balansat with a group show featuring three artists until June 20, with prices up to €50,000. The new space offers ground-floor and mezzanine galleries as well as a courtyard bar and restaurant designed by gallery artist Tai Shani. Gathering is among the 32 exhibitors at Ibiza's CAN art fair (June 26 - 30).

Art Basel will see Hauser & Wirth introducing "Stains on the Scenery" (2024, £200,000) by British painter George Rouy. The gallery has been representing him since 2amo and collaborated with London's Hannah Barry who initiated their partnership in 2017. White Cube now represents Howardena Pindell, an influential New York-based artist and curator, in Europe and Asia. They will bring her spray-painted "Tesseract #16" (2024, $500,000) to Art Basel and host her first solo show in Asia at their Hong Kong gallery in November.

Sean Kelly Gallery represents US ceramicist Brian Rochefort with two clay and glass works inspired by secluded landscapes for Art Basel ($22,000 each). The gallery plans a solo exhibition of his work in September. Rochefort is also represented by Massimo de Carlo and Van Doren Waxter
