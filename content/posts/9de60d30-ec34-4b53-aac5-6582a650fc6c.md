# 戴姆勒奔驰阿拉巴马州员工投票反对成立工会，给美国汽车工人联合会（UAW）带来打击

**美国汽车工人联合会（UAW）** 在美国南部争取外国汽车制造商员工加入工会的努力遭受重大挫折。周五，**梅赛德斯-奔驰**阿拉巴马州一家工厂的员工投票反对加入 UAW，反对票为 2,642 票，赞成票为 2,045 票。这一失败与 UAW 最近在查塔努加**大众**汽车厂的胜利结果截然相反，当时员工以压倒性多数票赞成成立工会。代表超过 **40 万名在职员工**的总部位于底特律的 UAW 原希望在胜利的势头上继续前进，并在福特、通用汽车和斯泰兰蒂斯员工中争取到破纪录的加薪。然而，**戴姆勒奔驰**和当地官员大力游说反对成立工会，该公司甚至更换了工厂 CEO，并实施了 11% 的加薪。尽管遭受了这次失败，UAW 主席仍决心继续组织工会的工作，专家预测，UAW 将继续争取其他外国汽车厂员工成立工会的运动，但采取更为谨慎的方式。这次投票凸显了工会在美国南部面临的挑战，该地区“工作权”法律和政治反对意见使得工会难以建立起来。

# Blow to UAW as Mercedes-Benz Workers in Alabama Vote Against Union

The **United Auto Workers** (**UAW**) union has suffered a significant setback in its efforts to organize workers at foreign-owned carmakers in the US South. On Friday, workers at a **Mercedes-Benz** plant in Alabama voted against joining the UAW, with 2,642 votes against and 2,045 in favor. This defeat is a **reversal** of the UAW's recent victory at a **Volkswagen** plant in Chattanooga, where workers voted overwhelmingly to unionize. The Detroit-based UAW, representing over **400,000 active workers**, had hoped to build on the momentum of this win and the record pay raises it secured for Ford, GM, and Stellantis employees. However, **Mercedes-Benz** and local officials campaigned aggressively against the union, with the company even replacing the plant's CEO and implementing an 11% pay raise. Despite this loss, the UAW president remains determined to continue organization efforts, and experts predict the union will persist in campaigning to organize workers at other foreign-owned car plants, albeit with a more cautious approach. This vote highlights the challenges unions face in the US South, where "right to work" laws and political opposition make it difficult to establish a presence.
