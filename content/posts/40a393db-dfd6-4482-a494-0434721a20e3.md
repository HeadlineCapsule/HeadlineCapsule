亚马逊推出新折扣区，准备与特卖和Shein一决高下

**亚马逊的新直邮中国折扣区**

为了应对电子商务竞争对手特买和谢恩的激烈竞争，亚马逊计划开设一个新的直邮中国折扣区。这一举动与竞争对手的商业模式相似，他们依靠直接从中国采购的低价产品。

亚马逊打算从中国的仓库将货物空运到美国，并在9到11天内送达超低价商品。这个新板块将在亚马逊应用程序的主页上突出显示，针对愿意比平时等待更长时间来获得优惠的美国消费者。

特买（PDD Holdings 拥有）和谢恩通过大胆的广告活动迅速发展，宣传低价产品，例如玩具和连衣裙。他们的商业模式依赖于中国商家将货物运送到位于中国南部的仓库，然后通过货运飞机运送到国外。

这两家公司利用了最低限额规则，允许价值低于一定金额（800美元）的包裹免税进口。这种做法引起了美国政客的批评，并导致提出了限制利用这一漏洞的立法提案。

亚马逊的新折扣区将包括价格低于20美元、重量不足一磅且非食用或液体性质的商品。该公司计划在今年夏天为该项目招募卖家，预计于秋季推出。这一举动可能会影响谢恩的前景，因为它正在准备在伦敦证券交易所上市。

亚马逊的市值最近超过了2万亿美元，该公司表示，他们“始终探索与销售合作伙伴的新合作方式，以更多选择、更低价格和更便捷的服务来满足客户的需求”。

 **Amazon's New Direct-from-China Discount Section**

In response to rising competition from ecommerce rivals Temu and Shein, Amazon is planning a new direct-from-China discount section. This move mirrors the business models of its competitors, which rely on low-cost offerings sourced directly from China. 

Amazon intends to airship goods to American shoppers from warehouses in China and deliver ultra-low-cost items within nine to eleven days. The new section will be featured prominently on the homepage of Amazon's app, targeting US consumers who are willing to wait longer than usual for a bargain.

Temu (owned by PDD Holdings) and Shein have grown rapidly through aggressive advertising campaigns featuring low-priced products such as toys and dresses. Their business models depend on Chinese merchants shipping goods to warehutes in southern China, which are then transported via cargo planes to foreign countries.

Both companies take advantage of the de minimis rule, allowing parcels under a certain value (US$800) to be imported without paying tariffs. This practice has drawn criticism from US politicians and led to proposed legislation aimed at restricting the use of this loophole.

Amazon's new discount section will include goods priced below $20, weighing less than a pound, and not edible or liquid in nature. The company plans to sign up sellers for the program this summer with an expected rollout in autumn. This move poses potential risks to Shein's prospects as it prepares for its initial public offering (IPO) on London's stock exchange.

Amazon, whose market value recently surpassed $2 trillion, stated that they are "always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices and greater convenience."
