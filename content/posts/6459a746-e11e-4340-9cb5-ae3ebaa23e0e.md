# 习近平和普京的友谊长存 

**中俄两国之间持久的伙伴关系仍然是地缘政治方面的一个重大问题**, 两国有着共同的对手--美国，他们认为美国是一种扩张主义的威胁。 正是因为有着这样的共识，两国才能团结一致，同时双方也相信保持友好关系可以挫败美国及其盟友试图对两国实施的 **"双重遏制"** 。这篇文章探讨了 **习近平和弗拉基米尔·普京之间的联系**, 他们有着共同的 **威权民族主义世界观**. 文章还分析了一些外部因素, 如俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以及朝鲜与俄罗斯的军事紧密关系，可能对两国关系产生何种影响。尽管由于地缘政治形势不同，莫斯科和北京之间存在潜在紧张局势，但双方的相互依赖预计将在可预见的未来继续维系他们的联系, 从而影响全球力量格局。 

亨利·基辛格在20世纪70年代策划的 **中美关系解冻** 极大地改变了冷战态势，对国际政治产生了持久的影响。如今，西方政府试图效仿这一策略，分裂莫斯科和北京，欧洲人希望通过习近平的影响力孤立俄罗斯，而华盛顿则将中国视为更为可怕的长期对手。这种战略分歧凸显了管理全球联盟的复杂性。 

由于入侵乌克兰, 俄罗斯已成为西方国家眼中的 "贱民", 而中国却与美国和欧洲保持着强大的贸易伙伴关系。这一动态影响了俄罗斯甘冒巨大风险的意愿，比如与朝鲜的军事合作，这可能被视为一种轻率的行为。此外，历史上中国曾向俄罗斯割让大片领土, 以及近来在地图制作方面的转变都进一步凸显了两国的实力不平衡。 

然而，这些紧张局势大多处于暗潮涌动的状态，与1971-1972年公开的中苏分裂不同，当时尼克松和基辛格看到了与中华人民共和国改善关系的机会。若想破坏当前的俄中联盟, 需要在诸如台湾或乌克兰等敏感问题上做出重大政策转变--而目前华盛顿并没有这样的打算。因此，**习近平与普京的友谊** 有望继续存续，尽管面临各种压力。

# The relationship between Xi and Putin is built to last 

**The enduring partnership** **between China and Russia remains a significant geopolitical issue**, with the two countries finding common ground in their shared antagonism towards the US, which they perceive as an expansionist threat. This unity is underscored by the belief that maintaining friendly relations foils "dual containment" attempts by the US and its allies. The article explores how this **bond between** **Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin**, characterized by a common worldview of **autocratic nationalism****,** may be influenced by external factors such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and North Korea's military closeness with Russia. Despite underlying tensions due to their differing geopolitical situations, the mutual reliance between Moscow and Beijing is expected to keep them bound together in the foreseeable future, impacting global power dynamics.

The **US-China rapprochement** engineered by Henry Kissinger in the 1970s significantly altered Cold War dynamics, leaving a lasting impression on international politics. Today's western governments seek to replicate this feat by dividing Moscow and Beijing, with Europeans aiming to isolate Russia through Xi Jinping's influence while Washington considers China as the more formidable long-term adversary. This divide in strategy highlights the complexity of managing global alliances.

While Russia has become a pariah state in the west due to its invasion of Ukraine, China maintains strong trade partnerships with both America and Europe. This dynamic influences Russia's willingness to take risks that may be perceived as reckless by China, such as their military closeness with North Korea. Additionally, China's historical cession of vast territories to Russia and recent cartographical shifts further emphasize the power imbalance between the two nations. 

However, these tensions remain largely subsurface, contrasting the open Sino-Soviet split in 1971–72 that presented a clear opportunity for Nixon and Kissinger to realign with China. To disrupt the current Russian-Chinese axis would require challenging policy shifts on sensitive issues such as Taiwan or Ukraine—shifts that currently lack support in Washington. As a result, **the Xi-Putin bond** is expected to persist despite underlying pressures.
