# 德国在纠正企业管治缺陷方面仍有很多工作要做

德国企业界，即 **Deutschland AG**，在其运营方式，特别是在传统 **高管** 晋升路径方面，即在同一家公司内从 **首席执行官** 晋升为 **董事长**，正在发生重大转变。尽管这种做法很常见，但它也导致了 **团体思维** 和抵制变革，影响了德国公司适应新趋势的能力。

**机构股东服务公司 (ISS)** 这家领先的全球咨询公司于 2021 年宣布，将不再支持前 **首席执行官** 担任或留任同一家公司的 **董事长**。这项政策从 2022 年开始生效，已经影响了投票建议，**代理顾问** 建议对某些个人的重新选举投反对票。尽管有抗议性投票，但董事长仍被重新选举，这表明由于缺乏明显的继任者，罢免现任董事长具有挑战性。

这种转变有可能影响德国董事会，减少传统的首席执行官向董事长的过渡。然而，批评人士认为，在解决德国 **企业管治** 长期存在的缺陷方面还有很多工作要做。其中一个缺陷是 **监事会** 权力有限，尽管他们负责监督 **执行委员会**，但无法向高管发号施令，并且与管理层以下的员工接触有限。

此外，股东在就潜在的 **受托责任** 违规行为对高管和监事会问责方面面临挑战。这种缺乏有效制衡的状况可能会导致问题，正如在 **Wirecard 丑闻** 中所看到的那样。尽管有这些担忧，但似乎没有什么政治动机来加强监事会或股东的权利，这表明柏林可能不优先考虑通过改善企业管治来增强股东信心。

# Germany still has much to do to fix corporate governance shortcomings

Germany's corporate world, **Deutschland AG**, is undergoing a significant shift in the way it operates, particularly regarding the traditional path of **top managers** moving from **chief executive** to **chair** within the same company. While this practice has been common, it has also contributed to **groupthink** and a resistance to change, impacting German companies' ability to adapt to new trends. 

**Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)**, a leading global advisory firm, announced in 2021 that it would no longer support former **CEOs** aspiring to become or remain **chairs** of the same company. This policy, effective as of 2022, has already influenced voting recommendations, with **proxy advisers** suggesting votes against the re-election of certain individuals. Despite protest votes, the chairs were re-elected, indicating the challenge of ousting a sitting chair due to the lack of obvious successors. 

This shift has the potential to impact German boardrooms by reducing the occurrence of the traditional CEO-to-chair transition. However, critics argue that more needs to be done to address long-standing flaws in German **corporate governance**. One such flaw is the limited power of **supervisory boards**, which, despite being responsible for overseeing the **executive board**, cannot give orders to executives and often have indirect contact with employees below the management board. 

Additionally, shareholders face challenges in holding executives and supervisory boards accountable for potential violations of **fiduciary duties**. This lack of effective checks and balances can lead to issues, as seen in the **Wirecard scandal**. Despite these concerns, there seems to be little political motivation to strengthen the rights of supervisory boards or shareholders, indicating that boosting shareholder confidence through improved corporate governance may not be a priority for Berlin.
