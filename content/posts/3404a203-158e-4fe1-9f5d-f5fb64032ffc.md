# **韩国国有能源垄断企业正洽谈在英国建造一座新核电站** 

**韩国国有能源公司** **韩国电力公司（Kepco）** 与**英国政府**进行早期阶段讨论，**在英国威尔士安格尔西岛的维尔法（Wylfa） site 建造一座新的核电站**。随着英国大部分现有核电站将于**本世纪末关闭**，这一发展或将极大地推动英国建造**新核电机组**的计划。 

**英国财政大臣杰里米·亨特（Jeremy Hunt）** 在 3 月的预算案中宣布，政府将购买**闲置的维尔法 site** 以及从**日立（Hitachi）**购买的另一个 site，以吸引新的私营部门投资。此举凸显英国到**2050 年实现 24GW 核电容量的雄心**，远超目前 6GW 的容量。 

业内人士证实，韩国电力公司对维尔法项目很感兴趣，并正积极与英国政府接洽。然而，一位韩国政府高级官员警告称，在英国建造核电站面临挑战，该公司需要确保有利的条件以避免财务损失。

维尔法 site的未来也将取决于现在拥有它的政府准政府机构**英国核能（GB Nuclear）** 所做的决定。他们将确定是否批准建造大型反应堆，或探讨建造**小型模块化反应堆（SMR）** 集群的潜力，后者因建造速度快、成本效益高而受到青睐。 

随着英国政府推动核能复兴并应对老化基础设施，韩国电力公司与英国政府之间的讨论结果将成为关键一步，将对未来几十年的英国能源格局产生深远影响。

# South Korean state energy monopoly in talks to build a new UK nuclear plant 

**South Korea's state-owned energy company**, **Kepco**, is in early-stage discussions with the **UK government** to potentially build a **new nuclear power plant** at the **Wylfa site in Anglesey, Wales**. This development could provide a significant boost to the UK's plans for a **new nuclear fleet** to address the impending closure of most of its current nuclear power stations by **the end of the decade**. 

The **UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt**, announced in the March Budget that the government would purchase the **mothballed Wylfa site** along with another from **Hitachi**, with the intention of attracting new private sector investment. This move underscores the UK's ambition to achieve **24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050**, a significant increase from the current 6GW. 

Industry sources confirm that Kepco is interested in the Wylfa project and is actively engaging with the UK government. However, a senior Korean government official cautions that building nuclear power stations in the UK comes with challenges, and the company would need to ensure favorable conditions to avoid financial losses. 

The future of the Wylfa site will also depend on decisions made by **GB Nuclear**, the government quango that now owns it. They will determine whether to approve the construction of a large reactor or explore the potential for a cluster of **small modular reactors (SMRs)**, which are touted for their relatively quick and cost-effective construction. 

With the UK government pushing for a nuclear revival and addressing the aging infrastructure, the outcome of these discussions between Kepco and the UK could be a pivotal step in shaping the country's energy landscape for decades to come.
