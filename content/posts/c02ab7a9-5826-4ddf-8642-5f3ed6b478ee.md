民主党“小队”成员因加沙战争分歧而在纽约初选中失利

**民主党“ squad ”成员贾马勒·鲍曼在纽约初选中失利**
这位来自纽约的民主党众议员在激烈的初选中被乔治·拉蒂默击败。这场选举成为进步派和温和派民主党人之间的战场，竞选期间出现了种族主义和反犹太主义的指控。

**关键因素：**
- 鲍曼批评以色列对哈马斯袭击的回应，导致纽约犹太社区内部出现紧张局势。
- 美国以色列公共事务委员会（AIPAC）花费1500万美元进行广告攻势，反对鲍曼，重点是他投票反对乔·拜登总统的基础设施法案，并描绘他缺乏对选区需求的关注。
- 温和派民主党人认为拉蒂默的胜利是未来选举挑战其他 squad 成员的潜在蓝图。

**意义：**
这次初选结果被视为民主党内部持续紧张局势的重要指标，尤其是进步派和温和派之间的紧张关系。伯尼·桑德斯在为鲍曼竞选时也强调了政治中的金钱作用。

 **Democratic 'Squad' member Jamaal Bowman loses New York primary**  
The Democratic congressman from New York was defeated by George Latimer in a highly contested primary. The race became a battleground between progressive and moderate Democrats, with allegations of racism and antisemitism surfacing during the campaign.

**Key factors:**
- Bowman's criticism of Israel's response to Hamas attacks led to tensions within the Jewish community in New York.
- The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent $15 million on an advertising blitz against Bowman, focusing on his vote against President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill and portraying him as lacking attention to district needs.
- Moderate Democrats view Latimer's victory as a potential blueprint for challenging other Squad members in future elections.

**Significance:**  
This primary result is seen as an important indicator of the ongoing tensions within the Democratic Party, particularly between progressive and moderate factions. The role of money in politics was also highlighted by Bernie Sanders during his campaigning with Bowman.
