# 斯洛伐克总理罗伯特·菲佐的生命体征稳定，已脱离危险

在 **汉德罗瓦** 镇遭遇 **刺杀未遂** 后，斯洛伐克 **总理罗伯特·菲佐** 经过手术治疗，目前情况稳定。这起枪击事件震惊了全国，同时也暴露了该国根深蒂固的 **政治分歧** 。作为一名 **民粹主义** 者及 **亲俄派** 领袖，菲佐在遇刺时正在与人们握手问候，他遭到了多次枪击，身中腹腔和手臂多枪。这起事件被认为有政治动机，发生在公众抗议菲佐近期选举胜利和司法改革期间。副总理 **托马什·塔拉巴** 证实，菲佐的病情已不再危及生命。国防部长兼菲佐盟友 **罗伯特·克里纳克** 称这一情况为“非常复杂”。一名71岁的持枪许可证拥有者已被拘留，成为该事件的嫌疑人。枪击事件引发了强烈反应，一些人警告可能会爆发 "政治战争"，而另一些人，包括即将离任的总统 **祖扎娜·恰普托娃** 在内，则呼吁缓和政治言论以防止此类暴力行为。

# Slovakia’s PM Robert Fico no longer in ‘life-threatening situation’

Slovakian **Prime Minister Robert Fico** is in stable condition after undergoing surgery following an **assassination attempt** in the town of Handlová. The shooting has shocked the country and exposed the deep **political divisions** within the nation. Fico, a **populist** and **pro-Russian** leader, was greeting people when he was shot multiple times in the stomach and arm. The incident has been described as politically motivated, occurring amid public protests over Fico's recent election victory and judicial reforms. Deputy Prime Minister Tomáš Taraba confirmed that Fico's condition is no longer life-threatening. Defense Minister Robert Kaliňák, a Fico ally, called the situation "very complicated." A 71-year-old licensed gun owner was detained as a suspect. The shooting has sparked strong reactions, with some warning of a potential "political war" while others, including outgoing President Zuzana Čaputová, have appealed for a toned-down political discourse to prevent such acts of violence.
