# **世界铂金投资委员会**：铂金市场将出现严重供应短缺

根据 **世界铂金投资委员会（WPIC）** 的一份报告，**全球铂金市场** 正面临着严重的供应缺口。预计这种缺口将推高价格，并已导致 **必和必拓（BHP）** 提议以 300 亿英镑以上的价格收购矿商 **英美资源集团（Anglo American）**。报告预测，2023 年全球铂金供需不平衡将达到 47.6 万盎司，占年度需求的 6%。这种缺口是由铂金最大生产国南非产量下降造成的。此外，**必和必拓提议分拆** 英美资源集团的铂金部门，但该提议于周一被英美资源集团拒绝，这进一步加剧了供应紧张的局势。

铂金市场的困境与近年来价格下跌形成鲜明对比，之前是关于 **电动汽车** 影响的猜测导致的。铂金是燃油发动机催化转换器中的关键成分，供应持续短缺可能会导致价格下跌逆转。然而，一些分析师认为，疫情期间积累的库存可能会减轻短缺的影响。在伦敦举行的 **铂金周会议** 上，行业高管们齐聚一堂，而此时世界铂金投资委员会的报告十分及时，预计铂金行业的未来和英美资源集团的铂金业务将成为会议的关键讨论议题。

# Platinum Market Headed for ‘Substantial’ Supply Shortfall, Says Industry Body 

**The global platinum market** is facing a significant supply deficit, according to a report by the **World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC)**. This deficit is expected to drive up prices and has already led to a proposed **£30bn-plus takeover** of miner **Anglo American** by rival **BHP**. The report forecasts a global demand-supply imbalance of 476,000 ounces of platinum in 2023, equivalent to 6% of annual demand. This deficit is due to a slowdown in production from South Africa, the largest producer of the metal. The situation has been further exacerbated by **BHP's proposed spin-off** of Anglo American's platinum unit, which was rejected by Anglo American on Monday.

The platinum market's woes are in contrast to recent years' price declines, which were driven by speculation on the impact of the rise of **electric vehicles (EVs)**. Platinum is a key component in catalytic converters for combustion engines, and a sustained deficit could see a reversal of these price declines. However, some analysts argue that stockpiles built up during the pandemic may offset the impact of the shortfall. The industry body's report is timely as executives gather in London for the **Platinum Week conference**, where the future of the platinum sector and Anglo American's platinum business are likely to be key topics of discussion.
