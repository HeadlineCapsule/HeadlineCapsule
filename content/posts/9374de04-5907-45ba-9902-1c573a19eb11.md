前Wirecard老板的顶级律师在资金耗尽后退出

# 前Wirecard首席执行官马克·布朗（Markus Braun）的辩护律师阿尔弗雷德·迪尔兰姆（Alfred Dierlamm）因资金不足退出案件，导致布朗遭遇重大挫折。与此同时，德国最大的公司欺诈审判正在进行中，布朗和两名Wirecard的前管理人员受到起诉。

## 要点：

1. **阿尔弗雷德·迪尔兰姆**是德国著名的白领犯罪律师，由于马克·布朗的资金不足，他退出对布朗的辩护。

2. 尽管迪尔兰姆离开了案件，但针对布朗的审判仍在继续，由一名政府支付费用的律师和他的两名国家资助的同事接管了他的角色。

3. Wirecard在2020年6月申请了破产，此前该公司披露了其收入的一半和19亿欧元的公司现金不存在，导致布朗被指控欺诈、背信、账户造假和市场操纵等罪名。

4. 迪尔兰姆的律师团队指责慕尼黑检察官处理案件不力，并试图证明Wirecard的资金在布朗不知情的情况下被他人挪用。然而，法官马克·福迪施（Markus Födisch）对这些论点提出了挑战，并在今年早些时候释放了一名关键证人。

5. 如果斯蒂芬·冯·埃尔法（Stephan von Erffa），Wirecard的前会计主管打破沉默，与法院进行持续的讨论，以达成一项可能减少其监禁时间的交易，审判可能会面临进一步的压力。

6. 如果被判有罪，布朗将面临最高15年的监禁，这是德国最大的公司欺诈案。

 **Summary of Article:**

The former Wirecard boss, Markus Braun, faced a significant setback as his top defense lawyer, Alfred Dierlamm, had to walk away from the case due to lack of funds. This development occurred amidst Germany's largest corporate fraud trial involving Braun and two other ex-Wirecard managers.

**Key Points:**

1. **Alfred Dierlamm**, a prominent white-collar crime lawyer in Germany, resigned from representing Markus Braun due to financial constraints as the funds of Braun'cuo directors and officers insurance ran out.
2. The trial against Braun continues despite Dierlamm's departure, with a government-paid lawyer taking over his role alongside two additional state-funded lawyers.
3. Wirecard filed for insolvency in June 2020 after disclosing that half of its revenue and €1.9bn in corporate cash did not exist, leading to charges against Braun including fraud, breach of trust, account rigging, and market manipulation.
4. Dierlamm's legal team had accused Munich prosecutors of mishandling the case, while attempting to prove that Wirecard funds were siphoned off by others without Braun's knowledge. However, Judge Markus Födisch challenged these arguments and released a key witness from custody earlier this year.
5. The trial may face further pressure if Stephan von Erffa, the former head of accounting at Wirecard, breaks his silence as part of ongoing discussions with the court about a potential deal that could reduce his jail term.
6. If found guilty, Braun faces up to 15 years in prison for his involvement in Germany's largest corporate fraud case.
