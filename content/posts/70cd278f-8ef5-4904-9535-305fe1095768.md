# 养老金基金要求英国核项目有**吸引力**的回报方能投资

**英国财政大臣**杰里米·亨特寻求地方政府养老金基金的投资，为政府雄心勃勃的核电目标提供资金。在最近与管理着超过1000亿英镑资产的市政厅养老金基金领导者的会议上，亨特讨论了这些基金对位于萨福克郡的**赛兹韦尔C核电项目**进行投资的可能性。管理着170亿英镑养老金资产的伦敦CIV表示，任何核电投资都需要**监管明晰**、**稳健的商业模式**和**有吸引力的与通胀挂钩的回报**。出席会议的Brunel养老金合作公司首席执行官劳拉·查佩尔也表达了同样的观点，她强调需要连贯的政策和有吸引力的投资建议。

向养老金基金推销的时机正值英国核工业面临重大挑战之际，包括**欣克利角C**核电站项目成本超支和工期延误。开发赛兹韦尔C项目的EDF能源公司保证该项目将更便宜，但监管机构要求政府提供成本确定性。在政府早些时候表示可能会进行改革，通过在即将推出的英国**绿色分类**中将核能归类为**“环境可持续”**，使核能投资对养老基金更具吸引力之后，亨特与养老金负责人举行了会晤。然而，政府尚未就这些改革进行咨询，而各部部长对养老基金在国内市场投资水平低的情况也越来越不满。

# Pension funds need ‘compelling’ returns from UK nuclear projects to invest

**UK Chancellor of the Exchequer** Jeremy Hunt is seeking investment from local authority pension funds to finance the government's ambitious nuclear power goals. In a recent meeting with leaders of town hall pension funds managing over £100 billion in assets, Hunt discussed the potential for these funds to invest in the **Sizewell C nuclear project** in Suffolk. London CIV, which manages £17 billion in pension assets, outlined that any investment in nuclear power would require **regulatory clarity**, a **solid business model**, and **compelling inflation-linked returns**. This sentiment was echoed by Laura Chappell, chief executive of the Brunel Pension Partnership, who attended the meeting and emphasized the need for consistent policy and a compelling investment proposition. 

The pitch to pension funds comes at a time when the UK's nuclear sector is facing significant challenges, including cost overruns and delays at the **Hinkley Point C** nuclear plant. EDF, the company developing Sizewell C, has assured that this project will be cheaper, but regulators have requested cost certainty from the government. Hunt's meeting with pension leaders follows the government's earlier indication of potential reforms to make nuclear investment more attractive to pension funds, including classifying nuclear power as "environmentally sustainable" under the UK's upcoming **green taxonomy**. However, the government is yet to consult on these reforms, and ministers are growing impatient with pension funds over low levels of investment in domestic markets.
