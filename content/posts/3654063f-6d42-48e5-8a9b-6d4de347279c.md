# 保守派应该冲击象牙塔

**美国高等教育** 面临一系列危机，人们开始质疑大学在社会中的价值和作用。作者是一位保守派人士，他认为现在是他们政治运动站出来对抗 "大教育"（**Big Ed**）的时候了，他强调了大学在**道德和知识**方面的失败，以及它们对学生和纳税人的**经济影响**。

尽管**定量和定性领域的智力崩溃**，及其 "复制危机 "和政治化的产出，已经得到了充分的记录，但 "人人上大学 "模式的失败对美国人的生活产生了最深远的影响，大多数学生未能顺利从**高中到大学到职业**过渡。这导致了一场学生债务危机，当前政府通过取消债务作为应对，预计将花费超过 1 万亿美元，这相当于政府财政承诺的追溯加倍。

作者认为，保守派应该重点批评大学是如何通过拥护**颠覆主流美国价值观**的使命，从而**放弃了它们应有的目的**。通过强调纳税人钱财的浪费和未能让年轻人为成功的人生做好准备，保守派可以提出更有力的改革理由，这将引起公众的共鸣。

建议的解决方案是**将资金从大学转移**到其他途径，如**学徒制计划**和**雇主主导的职业准备**。共和党参议员提出的《美国劳动力法案》被视为正确方向的一步，民意调查显示，美国人优先考虑技能发展和获得高薪工作，而不是学术潜力和大学声誉。通过削减对大学的资助，迫使它们提供学费贷款，同时建立非大学途径，保守派可以更好地为学生和公众服务。

# It's conservatives that should be storming the ivory tower

**American higher education** is facing a series of crises that are bringing into question the value and role of universities in society. The writer, a conservative, argues that it is time for their political movement to take on "Big Ed", highlighting not just the **moral and intellectual failures** of universities but also their **economic impact** on students and taxpayers. 

/n/n

The **intellectual collapse** of quantitative and qualitative fields, with their "replication crises" and politicized output, has been well-documented. But it is the failure of the "college-for-all" model that has the most significant impact on Americans' lives, with most students failing to transition smoothly from **high school to college to career**. This has resulted in a student debt crisis, with the current administration's response of debt cancellation set to cost over $1tn, a retrospective doubling of the government's financial commitment. 

/n/n

Conservatives, the writer argues, should focus their critique on how universities, in embracing a mission of **undermining mainstream American values**, have also **forsaken their proper purposes**. By emphasizing the waste of taxpayer money and the failure to prepare young people for successful lives, conservatives can make a stronger case for reform that resonates with the general public. 

/n/n

The proposed solution is to **redirect funding away from universities** and towards alternative pathways, such as **apprenticeship programs** and **employer-led career preparation**. The American Workforce Act, introduced by Republican senators, is cited as a step in the right direction, and polling suggests that Americans prioritize skills development and access to well-paying jobs over academic potential and college reputations. By defunding universities and forcing them to finance tuition loans, while also building non-college pathways, conservatives can provide a better service to both students and the public.
