# 格鲁吉亚的不祥对峙

格鲁吉亚首都和第比利斯，一个前 **苏联共和国**，目前正目睹大规模的 **亲民主** 抗议活动，这让人想起 2014 年的乌克兰基辅。受与 **莫斯科关联的寡头** 毕齐纳·伊万尼什维利影响的格鲁吉亚政府，正准备通过一项将 **镇压反对声音** 并可能破坏该国加入 **欧盟** 和 **北约** 愿望的法律。这导致抗议者与防暴警察之间形成对峙，预计该法律将于周二进行最终阅读。

格鲁吉亚有 **颜色革命** 的历史，在 2003 年经历了亲民主起义，随后在 2008 年遭到 **俄罗斯入侵**。目前执政的 **格鲁吉亚梦想党** 背后有伊万尼什维利的支持，他在 **后苏联时代的俄罗斯** 积累了财富。尽管该党口头上支持加入欧盟和北约的愿望，但在必要改革方面进展有限。去年，他们试图通过一项针对 **外国资助的非政府组织和媒体** 的法律，类似于 **俄罗斯的“外国代理人”法**，但由于抗议和欧盟的压力而退缩。

随着 10 月选举的临近，执政党再次推动有争议的法律，这可能是为了提高他们的选举胜算并维持与莫斯科的友好关系。当地人猜测，伊万尼什维利和他的忠诚精英可能更倾向于避免加入欧盟，因为加入欧盟的条件与 **寡头改革** 和 **反腐败** 有关。政府还利用了格鲁吉亚社会的社会保守主义，强调欧盟对 LGBT 权利的支持。

尽管附近的 **分裂势力南奥塞梯地区** 存在俄罗斯军队，但抗议者仍决心继续对峙。对亲欧的格鲁吉亚人来说，最好的情况是能在即将到来的选举中击败格鲁吉亚梦想党。然而，反对力量过于分散，而且“外国代理人”法为政府镇压异议提供了有力工具。

这一局势给欧盟带来了外交挑战。为了支持格鲁吉亚亲欧洲的大多数人，欧盟必须向执政党发出明确信息，如果该法律通过，可能暂停该国的欧盟候选资格。如果对抗议者进行暴力镇压，也应考虑对伊万尼什维利的财富实施制裁。同时，欧盟必须向格鲁吉亚人民保证，如果废除该法律并进行真正的改革，加入欧盟的大门仍然敞开。西方国家还必须与格鲁吉亚民间社会和反对派保持联系，支持他们的民主愿望。

# An ominous stand-off in Georgia

**Tbilisi**, the capital of Georgia and a former **Soviet republic**, is currently witnessing mass **pro-democracy** protests reminiscent of those in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2014. The Georgian government, influenced by a **Moscow-linked oligarch**, Bidzina Ivanishvili, is set to pass a law that would **suppress opposition** and potentially derail the country's aspirations to join the **EU** and **NATO**. This has led to a stand-off between protesters and riot police, with the final reading of the law expected as soon as Tuesday. 

Georgia has a history of **colored revolutions**, having experienced a pro-democracy uprising in 2003, followed by a **Russian invasion** in 2008. The current ruling party, **Georgian Dream**, is backed by Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in **post-Soviet Russia**. Despite paying lip service to EU and NATO aspirations, the party has made limited progress on necessary reforms. Last year, they attempted to pass a law targeting **foreign-funded NGOs and media**, similar to **Russia's "foreign agents" law**, but backed down due to protests and EU pressure. 

With October elections approaching, the ruling party is once again pushing for the controversial law, which may be an attempt to improve their electoral chances and maintain friendly relations with Moscow. Locals speculate that Ivanishvili and his loyal elites may prefer to avoid EU membership due to conditions related to **oligarch reform** and **corruption**. The government has also leveraged the social conservatism of Georgian society, emphasizing the EU's support for LGBT rights. 

The protesters are determined to continue their stand-off, despite the presence of Russian troops in the nearby **breakaway South Ossetia region**. The best-case scenario for pro-Europe Georgians is to vote Georgian Dream out in the upcoming elections. However, the opposition is fragmented and the "foreign agents" law gives the government a powerful tool to suppress dissent. 

The situation presents a diplomatic challenge for the EU. To support Georgia's pro-European majority, the EU must send a clear message to the ruling party, potentially suspending the country's EU candidacy if the law passes. Sanctions on Ivanishvili's wealth should also be considered if there is a violent crackdown on protesters. Simultaneously, the EU must reassure Georgians that the path to membership remains open if the law is repealed and genuine reform progress is made. Western countries must also maintain connections with Georgian civil society and the opposition to support their democratic aspirations.
