美国寻求欧盟制裁保证以支持500亿美元乌克兰贷款

**美国寻求欧盟对乌克兰500亿美元贷款的制裁保证**

美国提议欧洲联盟（EU）无限期延长对俄罗斯的制裁，以支持向乌克兰提供约500亿美元的贷款。美国要求在欧洲持有的俄罗斯资产，尤其是被比利时中央证券存管机构Euroclear冻结的资产，每年产生约30亿欧元的收入，在俄罗斯同意为给乌克兰造成的损失支付赔偿之前，这些资产必须被冻结。

该贷款将使用这些被冻结的俄罗斯资产的利润来偿还，并取决于欧盟保证此类资产无法获得的条件。美国旨在在即将举行的七国集团峰会之前达成协议，在该峰会上，这一融资机制可能会对支持乌克兰发挥重要作用。

然而，实施这一计划将需要27个欧盟成员国的一致批准，包括匈牙利领导人维克多·奥班，他以前曾对制裁决定行使过否决权。如果欧盟未能延长制裁或利润不足，美国也在探索与其他七国集团合作伙伴分担风险的其他选择。

贷款的细节有待确定，可能涉及多个七国集团国家之间的合作，可能通过世界银行等中介机构进行。美国还考虑为此目的利用欧盟共同预算中的“头室”。这将需要成员国之间的一致同意。

随着压力增加，要求在持续冲突和11月即将举行的选举中向乌克兰提供最大限度的财务援助，美国、欧盟财政部长和七国集团领导人继续讨论这种贷款机制的可行性。

 **US Seeks EU Sanctions Guarantee for $50bn Ukraine Loan**

The United States is proposing that the European Union (EU) extend sanctions against Russia indefinitely to support a loan of approximately $50 billion to Ukraine. The US requires Russian assets held within Europe, particularly those frozen in Belgium's central security depository Euroclear, generating an estimated €3bn annually, to be immobilized until Russia agrees to pay for the damage caused to Ukraine.

The loan would be repaid using profits from these frozen Russian assets and is conditional on the EU guaranteeing that such assets remain inaccessible. The US aims to reach an agreement ahead of the upcoming G7 summit, where this funding mechanism will likely play a significant role in supporting Ukraine.

However, implementing this plan would require unanimous approval from all 27 EU member states, including Hungary's leader Viktor Orbán, who has previously exercised his veto rights over sanctions decisions. The US is also exploring other options to share the potential risk with G7 partners in case of insufficient profits or failure by the EU to extend sanctions.

The loan details are yet to be determined and may involve collaboration between multiple G7 states, potentially through intermediaries like the World Bank. The US is also considering utilizing "headroom" within the EU's common budget for this purpose, which would require unanimous agreement among member states.

As pressure mounts to maximize financial aid to Ukraine amidst ongoing conflict and upcoming elections in November, discussions continue between the US, EU finance ministers, and G7 leaders regarding the feasibility of such a loan mechanism.
