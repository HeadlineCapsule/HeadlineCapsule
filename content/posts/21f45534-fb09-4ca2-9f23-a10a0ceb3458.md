佛蒙特州成为美国第一个要求大石油公司为气候变化造成的损失付费的州。

# 佛蒙特州成为美国第一个要求化石燃料公司支付气候损害费用的州

佛蒙特州成为美国第一个通过法律要求**大石油**公司为气候损害付费的州。新立法命令佛蒙特州财政部长在2026年1月2日之前提交一份报告，概述过去近二十年温室气体排放对该州公共卫生、经济发展等各个方面的总成本。预计埃克森美孚和雪佛龙等化石燃料公司将对这一举措提出法律挑战。

## 相关问题：

**Q1**：佛蒙特州的新法律如何符合“污染者付费”原则，这对考虑类似立法的其他州有何影响？
**A1**："污染者付费"的原则认为，造成污染的人应该承担管理污染的费用，以防止对人类健康或环境造成损害。佛蒙特州的新法律符合这一原则，要求被认定为温室气体排放和气候变化主要贡献者的化石燃料公司为该州造成的损害付费。这一举措可能为其他考虑类似立法的州树立先例，从而导致全国范围内污染者更广泛地承担责任。

**Q2**：佛蒙特州在量化和归因于化石燃料公司的气候变化成本时可能面临哪些挑战？
**A2**：将气候变化成本量化并归因于特定的化石燃料公司存在多个挑战，包括建立这些公司排放与佛蒙特州所经历的损害之间的明确因果关系。此外，准确评估各个部门或公司历史排放的范围以及确定每个公司应为整体气候变化影响承担多少责任也可能存在困难。

**Q3**：化石燃料公司的法律挑战如何影响佛蒙特州新法律的实施和潜在成功？
**A3**：化石燃料公司的法律挑战可能会显著影响佛蒙特州新法律的实施和成功，延缓甚至阻止其执行。这些挑战可能集中在管辖权、宪法可行性或准确地将气候变化成本归因于特定公司等问题上。这些法律斗争的结果将影响其他州是否会推行类似立法以及法院如何解释让污染者为环境损害承担经济责任的法律。

**Summary:**
Vermont has become the first US state to pass a law requiring fossil fuel companies, also referred to as **Big Oil**, to pay for climate damages. The new legislation orders Vermont's treasurer to provide a report by January 2n, 2026 outlining the total cost of greenhouse gas emissions over roughly two decades on various aspects such as public health and economic development in the state. This move is expected to face legal challenges from fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron.

**Interesting Questions:**
Q1: How does Vermont's new law align with the "polluter pays" principle, and what implications might this have for other states considering similar legislation?
A1: The "polluter pays" principle holds that those responsible for pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment. Vermont's new law aligns with this principle by requiring fossil fuel companies, identified as major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, to pay for damages caused in the state. This move could set a precedent for other states considering similar legislation, potentially leading to more widespread accountability of polluters across the country.

Q2: What challenges might Vermont face as it attempts to quantify and attribute climate change costs specifically to fossil fuel companies?
A2: Quantifying and attributing climate change costs to specific fossil fuel companies presents several challenges, including establishing a clear causal link between emissions from these companies and the damages experienced in Vermont. Additionally, there may be difficulties in accurately assessing the extent of historical emissions by individual sectors or companies, as well as determining how much responsibility each company should bear for overall climate change impacts.

Q3: How might legal challenges from fossil fuel companies affect the implementation and potential success of Vermont's new law?
A3: Legal challenges from fossil fuel companies could significantly impact the implementation and success of Vermont's new law by delaying or even preventing its enforcement. These challenges may focus on issues such as jurisdiction, constitutionality, or the feasibility of accurately attributing climate change costs to specific companies. The outcome of these legal battles will likely influence whether other states pursue similar legislation and how courts interpret laws holding polluters financially accountable for environmental damages.
