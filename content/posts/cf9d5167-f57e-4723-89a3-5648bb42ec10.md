# 英伟达有望成为美国最有价值的股票

**英伟达**（Nvidia）经历了前所未有的增长，其在不到九个月的时间内，市值从 1 万亿美元翻了一番，达到 2 万亿美元，其**生成式人工智能**（generative artificial intelligence）芯片需求量也非常高。尽管人们担心其估值过高，但与自身市场历史和潜在市场规模相比，英伟达的股价并不算过高。该公司拥有两方面关键优势，使其胜过竞争对手：一是在 AI 芯片市场的**先发优势**（head start），二是拥有**封闭生态系统**（closed ecosystem）的**CUDA 平台**（CUDA platform），为客户提供一站式服务。这使其占据了市场主导地位，毛利率也显著提高。随着下一阶段的生成式人工智能**推理**（inference）市场规模将更大，而英伟达最新的芯片处理速度是其 30 倍，该公司有望继续成功，并成为美国最有价值的股票。

# Nvidia could be the most valuable stock in the US 

**Nvidia** has experienced unprecedented growth, doubling its market capitalization from $1tn to $2tn in under nine months, and its **generative artificial intelligence** (AI) chips are in high demand. Despite concerns about inflated valuations, a comparison with its own market history and the potential size of its market indicates that Nvidia's stock is not overvalued. The company has two key advantages over rivals: a **head start** in the AI chip market and a **closed ecosystem** with its **CUDA platform**, which offers a one-stop shop for customers. This has led to dominant market positioning and impressive gross margin increases. With the next stage of generative AI, **inference**, set to be a larger market, and Nvidia's latest chip processing these requests 30 times faster, the company is well-positioned to continue its success and become the most valuable stock in the US.
