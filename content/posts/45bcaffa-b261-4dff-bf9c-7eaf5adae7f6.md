# 马乔里·泰勒·格林的“美国第一”立场是否太极端，连特朗普也无法接受？

来自乔治亚州右翼的**国会女议员**马乔里·泰勒·格林（Marjorie Taylor Greene）以其极端的观点和阴谋论而闻名，在最近几周面临着批评和尴尬处境，甚至她的政党也开始反对她。格林是一名忠实的特朗普支持者，是共和党内部**“美国第一”（MAGA）**派系的典型代表，她鼓吹**选举欺诈**的说法，并将特朗普与**耶稣**和**纳尔逊·曼德拉**相提并论。然而，特朗普并没有回报她的忠诚，越来越多的人认为她正在成为共和党的负担。格林的好斗行为和争议性言论，包括她提出的 **"太空激光"* 理论，使其在共和党内受到嘲笑和孤立。特朗普在竞选中注重中间派选民，似乎正在与格林保持距离，这表明她对他来说已经没有利用价值。这篇文章还暗示了两人之间可能存在个人反感或脱节，特朗普在多个场合无视格林。作为共和党提名人，特朗普不再需要格林来吸引右翼选民，而与她的联系可能不利于他的竞选活动。

# Is Marjorie Taylor Greene too Maga for Trump? 

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the right-wing **congresswoman** from Georgia, known for her extreme views and conspiracy theories, has faced criticism and embarrassment in recent weeks, with even her own party turning against her. Greene, a loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump and the embodiment of the **Maga** faction within the **GOP**, has promoted **election fraud** claims and compared Trump to **Jesus** and **Nelson Mandela**. However, Trump has not reciprocated her loyalty, and there is a growing sense that she is becoming a liability for the party. Greene's aggressive behavior and controversial statements, including her suggestion of **"space lasers"**, have led to ridicule and isolation within her own party. Trump, focusing on the center ground for his campaign, seems to be distancing himself from Greene, indicating that her usefulness to him may have come to an end. The article also hints at a possible personal dislike or disconnect between the two, with Trump ignoring Greene on several occasions. As the party nominee, Trump no longer needs Greene to appeal to the right-wing base, and her association with him may even be detrimental to his campaign.
