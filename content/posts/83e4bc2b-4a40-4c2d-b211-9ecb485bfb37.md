# 优步在法律成本影响下公布财报，十年来一直面临监管挑战 

**优步**第一季度业绩未达预期，运营利润为1.72亿美元，远低于分析师预测的6亿多美元。该公司将此归因于**法律和监管成本**，包括向澳大利亚出租车司机集体诉讼支付的1.78亿美元和解金。尽管如此，该季度相比2023年第一季度有所改善，2023年第一季度运营亏损为2.62亿美元。 

周三早盘，优步股价下跌9%，反映出投资者的担忧。该公司在全球范围内面临监管挑战，尤其是在**司机和送货员薪酬**方面。最近的例子是伦敦黑色出租车司机提起的数千万英镑诉讼。 

优步在实现盈利的道路上经历了动荡，其叫车业务面临巨大亏损和激烈竞争。该公司通过提高利润率和降低成本的努力，在2023年实现了首个全面运营盈利年份。然而，本季度6.54亿美元的净亏损主要是由于**Aurora和DiDi**等公司股份价值减记所致。 

虽然营收增长15%至101亿美元，符合预期，但优步的叫车、送餐和货运总订单额为377亿美元，略低于预期，原因是拉丁美洲需求疲软。该公司对未来增长保持乐观，强调了其业务的扩张，如杂货配送，以及利润率较高的**广告业务**的潜力。 

最近与**Instacart**的合作伙伴关系使优步能够通过Uber Eats提供餐馆送餐服务，增强了其在全美郊区对抗**DoorDash**的竞争力。优步还表示致力于其 "杂货和零售战略"，并预计很快将有进一步公告。此外，该公司还在探索**自动驾驶车辆**方面的机会，相信这将惠及消费者及企业。 

为提高股东价值，优步启动了70亿美元的股票回购计划，表明其专注于可持续盈利能力和长期增长。

# Uber's results hit by legal costs after a decade of regulatory battles 

**Uber's** first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with operating profits of $172 million, well below analysts' forecasts of over $600 million. The company attributed this to **legal and regulatory costs**, including a $178 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit by Australian taxi drivers. Despite this, the quarter showed improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023, which saw an operating loss of $262 million. 

/n/n

Uber's shares dropped 9% in early trading on Wednesday, reflecting investor concerns. The company has faced regulatory challenges worldwide, particularly regarding **driver and delivery worker pay**. A recent example is a multimillion-pound lawsuit by London black cab drivers. 

/n/n

Uber's path to profitability has been tumultuous, marked by steep losses and intense competition in the ride-hailing market. The company's efforts to improve margins and reduce costs resulted in its first full year of operating profitability in 2023. However, the latest quarter's net loss of $654 million was primarily due to writedowns in the value of Uber's stakes in other companies, including **Aurora and DiDi**. 

/n/n

While revenue rose 15% to $10.1 billion, meeting forecasts, Uber's total ride-hailing, delivery, and freight bookings slightly missed expectations at $37.7 billion due to softer demand in Latin America. The company remains optimistic about future growth, highlighting the expansion of its services, such as grocery delivery, and the potential of its high-margin **advertising business**. 

/n/n

A recent partnership with **Instacart** allows Uber to offer restaurant deliveries through Uber Eats, enhancing its competitiveness against **DoorDash** in suburban America. Uber also expressed commitment to its "grocery and retail strategy," with further announcements expected soon. Additionally, the company is exploring opportunities in **autonomous vehicles**, believing they will benefit both consumers and the business. 

/n/n

To enhance shareholder value, Uber has initiated a $7 billion share buyback program, demonstrating its focus on sustainable profitability and long-term growth.
