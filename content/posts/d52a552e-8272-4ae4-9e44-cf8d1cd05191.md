# 黄循财，新加坡下一任总理，面临愈发艰难的平衡之道 

**黄循财**，新加坡**副领导人**，将于 2024 年 5 月 15 日成为该国二十年来**首位新总理**。随着这个城市国家自独立以来的**第三次权力过渡**，他将面临日益复杂的地理政治格局和不断上升的社会紧张局势。黄循财曾是一名公务员和经济学家，他迅速晋升，在担任**财政部长**并随后成为**副总理**之前，曾在各个部门任职。他以在新加坡**新冠肺炎**疫情期间的高效处理而著称，他的总理任命标志着延续性，而不是激进的改变。

黄循财在上任之时，新加坡正面临生活成本上升、**不平等**和对外来工人的不满情绪。执政的**人民行动党（PAP）**也面临着变得更加包容的压力，而**中美竞争**则使这个中立国处于微妙境地。黄循财的平凡背景和技术官僚风格可能有助于他与公众建立联系，但他需要证明自己的领导能力，并适应不断变化的经济形势。随着大选即将到来，黄循财面临着一项艰巨任务，即赢得强大的民意授权并应对新加坡面临的挑战。南洋理工大学副教授唐爱文认为，新加坡的未来之路必须来自内部，这对新任总理提出了重大任务。

# Lawrence Wong, Singapore's next PM, faces an ever-trickier balancing act 

**Lawrence Wong**, Singapore's **deputy leader**, will become the country's **first new prime minister** in two decades on May 15, 2024. He will navigate a challenging geopolitical landscape and rising social tensions as the city-state's **third transition of power** since independence takes place. Wong, a former civil servant and economist, has risen quickly through the ranks, serving in various ministries before becoming **finance minister** and then **deputy prime minister**. Known for his role in Singapore's efficient handling of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, Wong's appointment as prime minister signals continuity rather than radical change. 

Wong takes office as Singapore faces a rising **cost of living**, **inequality**, and resentment towards **foreign workers**. The ruling **People's Action Party (PAP)** has also come under pressure to become more inclusive, and the **US-China rivalry** creates a delicate situation for the neutral country. Wong's humble background and technocratic style may help him connect with the public, but he will need to prove his ability to lead and adapt to the changing economic landscape. With a general election expected soon, Wong has his work cut out to gain a strong mandate and address the challenges facing Singapore. The country's future path, according to Professor Donald Low, must come from within, presenting a significant task for the new prime minister.
