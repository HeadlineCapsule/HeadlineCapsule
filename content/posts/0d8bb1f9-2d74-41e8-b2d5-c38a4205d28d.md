# 英国工党工作人员对假期限制感到不满，选举在即疲劳加剧

**英国工党**工作人员因严格的**假期限制**而感到极度疲惫和沮丧，因为预计会突然举行大选。在选举日期尚不确定之际，工作人员被建议避免连续休假超过两天，这影响了他们的工作生活平衡和福祉。这造成了一种不断处于**竞选状态**的感觉，而党的**竞选主任**帕特·麦克法登也承认了这种高强度环境。这些限制尤其具有挑战性，因为它们出现的时机正值该党因拟议的**工人权利改革**方案（包括**下班后断网的权利**）而面临工会批评之时。相比之下，**保守党**尚未对其工作人员实施类似的限制，尽管一旦正式宣布选举，这一情况预计将发生变化。然而，保守党也面临着自己的挑战，包括多数席位减少和民意调查结果不佳，这影响了一些工作人员的士气，并使他们的心态转向未来在反对派的地位。随着选举日期临近，双方都在为激烈的竞选期做准备，工党工作人员预计在竞选期间将每周工作六天，而前座议员则预计将面临紧张的日程安排，几乎没有喘息的机会。预计选举将在2025年1月或之前举行，具体日期由英国首相里希·苏纳克决定。

# Tired Labour staffers chafe at holiday restrictions as election looms

Labour Party staffers in the UK are experiencing high levels of fatigue and frustration due to strict **holiday restrictions** imposed in anticipation of a snap general election. With the election date still unknown, staffers have been advised to avoid taking more than two consecutive days off, impacting their work-life balance and well-being. This has created a sense of being on a constant **campaign footing**, with the party's **campaign chief**, Pat McFadden, acknowledging the high-intensity environment. The restrictions are particularly challenging as they come at a time when the party is also facing criticism from unions over changes to its proposed package of **worker rights reforms**, including the **right to disconnect**. The Conservative Party, in contrast, has not yet imposed similar restrictions on its staffers, although this is expected to change once the election is officially called. The Tories, however, face their own challenges, including a reduced majority and poor polling numbers, which have impacted the morale of some staffers and shifted their mindset toward a future in opposition. As the election date looms, both parties are gearing up for an intense campaign period, with Labour staffers expecting to work six days a week during the campaign and frontbenchers anticipating a demanding schedule with little respite. The election is expected to take place no later than January 2025, with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in control of the exact timing.
