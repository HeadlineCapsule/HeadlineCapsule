今年欧洲注册的中国造电动汽车数量增长近四分之一

# 尽管面临关税威胁，中国制造的电动汽车在欧洲注册数量增加

包括英国在内的西欧地区注册的中国制造电动汽车（EV）数量在1月至4月之间同比增长了23%。即使在中国制造电池驱动汽车的关税可能提高之际，这一增长仍然显得非常显著。

根据施密特汽车研究（Schmidt Automotive Research）的数据，在此期间，有**119,300辆中国制造的电动汽车**注册，占该区域进口电动汽车的五分之一。汽车制造商继续在中国生产和出口的主要原因是，目前在中国制造电动汽车是最有利可图的。

由于欧盟对从中国进口的电动汽车征收10%的关税，而美国在上个月则征收了100%的关税，因此欧盟已成为中国出口商的首选市场。预计欧盟将在7月完成一项调查，以确定北京的补贴是否允许中国制造的电动汽车低于欧洲的价格。

特斯拉、大众和本田等在中国制造的西欧和日本品牌在这一时期占中国制造电动汽车注册总数的54%。其余部分由MG和比亚迪等中国品牌组成。在中国制造汽车的成本更低，这促使西方品牌在中国生产电动汽车，然后将其进口到欧洲。

尽管一些依赖中国市场的西方汽车制造商担心报复，但全球汽车制造商高管已表示反对在全球范围内对中国制造的电动汽车征收关税。一些制造商正在考虑在其他地区进行生产或扩大现有设施以避免更高的关税。

分析师预计，由于欧洲消费者对中国品牌的认识有限以及电动汽车进口关税可能增加，从中国进口的增长速度将放缓。

 # Summary: Increase in China-made EVs registered in Europe despite tariff threats

The number of **China-made electric vehicles (EVs)** registered in Western Europe, including the UK, has seen a significant increase of 23% between January and April compared to the previous year. This growth occurred even with the looming threat of higher tariffs on battery-run cars made in China.

According to Schmidt Automotive Research, **119,300 Chinese-made EVs** were registered during this period, accounting for one in five electric vehicles imported into the region. The primary reason behind carmakers continuing to produce and export from China is that it currently offers the best opportunity to make a profit on an electrical vehicle.

The European Union (EU) has become the preferred market for Chinese exporters, partly due to its 10% tariff on EV imports from China. In contrast, the United States imposed a 100% tariff last month. The EU is expected to finalize an investigation into whether Beijing's subsidies have allowed Chinese-made EVs to undercut European vehicles in July.

Western and Japanese brands manufactured in China, such as Tesla, Volkswagen, and Honda, accounted for 54% of the total registered Chinese-made EVs during this period. The remaining percentage was made up by Chinese brands like MG and BYD. Manufacturing cars in China is cheaper, leading western brands to produce electric vehicles there before importing them to Europe.

Despite concerns over retaliation among Western carmakers reliant on the Chinese market, global carmaker executives have spoken out against tariffs on Chinese-made EVs globally. Some manufacturers are hedging their bets by considering production in other locations or expanding existing facilities to avoid higher tariffs.

Analysts expect growth in imports from China to slow going forward due to limited European consumer awareness of Chinese brands and the potential for increased tariffs on EV imports.
