# **英国**股票终于闪耀登场

经过多年的表现不如人意，**英国股票市场**在 2024 年强劲上涨，**富时 100 指数**首次突破 8,000 点大关。这波强势上涨受多种因素驱动，包括：由于估值吸引人而吸引了猎寻便宜货的投资者、缺乏负面的**英国例外论**、强劲的油价，以及一波企业活动，包括收购和合并。**英格兰银行**可能削减**利率**的前景和新上市浪潮的潜在到来，进一步支撑了市场的势头。尽管可能举行**大选**并可能改变政府，但投资者仍保持放松态度，因为政治事件向来对英国股市影响甚微。**高盛**和**瑞银**的分析师已开始看好英国市场，他们指出，与全球其他市场相比，英国的条件有所改善，且估值具有吸引力。**富时 100 指数**的表现超越了其欧洲同行，甚至可与美股一较高下，使英国成为当前投资领域中一个意想不到的亮点。

# UK stocks are finally shining

After years of underperformance, the **UK stock market** has surged in 2024, with the **FTSE 100** index surpassing 8,000 for the first time. This strong performance has been driven by various factors, including bargain hunting due to attractive valuations, a lack of negative **UK exceptionalism**, robust oil prices, and a stream of corporate activity, including takeovers and mergers. The market's momentum is further supported by the prospect of **interest rate cuts** by the **Bank of England** and a potential wave of new listings. Despite the prospect of a **general election** and a possible change in government, investors remain relaxed, with political events historically having a minimal impact on UK stocks. Analysts from **Goldman Sachs** and **UBS** have turned positive on the UK market, citing improved conditions and attractive valuations compared to other global markets. The **FTSE 100's** performance has outpaced its European peers and even challenged the US market, making the UK an unexpected standout in the current investment landscape.
