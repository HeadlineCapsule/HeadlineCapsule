# 美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔暗示，随着美国**通胀**持续，利率将保持高位

**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**(**Jay Powell**)作为**联邦储备委员会**(**Federal Reserve**)主席，他表示，由于**通货膨胀**持续高企，美国利率可能高于最初预期，持续较长时间。鲍威尔在阿姆斯特丹发表讲话时，承认了美国经济表现强劲，但表达了对降低**通胀**缺乏进展的担忧，表示距离美联储的目标水平仍有差距。他预计**通胀**水平会下降，但对这一预测缺乏信心，强调需要耐心等待**收紧的货币政策**产生效果。鲍威尔重申，美联储不计划进一步加息，认为当前的政策利率已经是限制性的。**埃弗科亚公司(Evercore-ISI)**的**克里什纳·古哈**(**Krishna Guha**)也表达了同样观点，他认为鲍威尔的言论表明，美联储可能会将降息推迟至至少9月份。

市场在鲍威尔讲话后变化不大，因为投资者已经根据2024年全年高于预期的**通胀**水平调整了预期。与此形成对比的是，随着**价格压力**的持续缓解，欧洲的**中央银行**正在考虑降息。瑞士和瑞典的中央银行已经降低了利率，预计**欧洲中央银行(ECB)**也将在6月跟随降息。然而，欧洲央行决策者**克拉斯·诺特**(**Klaas Knot**)警告说，美国最近的**通胀**趋势可能是一个警告信号，敦促在欧洲宣布战胜**通胀**时要谨慎。他还强调了生产力增长疲弱对劳动力成本的影响，表示6月之后进一步放松政策存在不确定性。美联储的谨慎态度还得到了4月**生产者价格指数**上涨的支持，这表明**通胀**压力仍是一个值得关注的问题。目前，市场关注焦点转向即将发布的美国**消费者价格指数**数据，这将为**通胀**走势和货币政策的下一步提供更多启示。

# Fed's Jay Powell Hints Interest Rates will Stay High as US Inflation Lingers 

**Jay Powell**, chair of the **Federal Reserve**, has indicated that interest rates in the US may remain high for longer than initially anticipated due to persistent **inflation**. Speaking in Amsterdam, Powell acknowledged the strong performance of the US economy but expressed concern about the lack of progress in reducing inflation to the Fed's target rate. While he expects inflation to decrease, he noted a lack of confidence in this prediction and emphasized the need for patience to allow **restrictive monetary policy** to take effect. Powell also reiterated that the Fed does not plan to raise interest rates further, stating that the current policy rate is already restrictive. This sentiment was echoed by **Krishna Guha** of Evercore-ISI, who interpreted Powell's comments as a sign that the Fed may delay any rate cuts until at least September. 

Markets remained relatively unchanged following Powell's remarks, as investors have previously adjusted their expectations due to higher-than-forecast inflation throughout 2024. In contrast, **central banks** in Europe are considering rate cuts as **price pressures** continue to ease. The Swiss and Swedish central banks have already lowered rates, and the **European Central Bank (ECB)** is expected to follow suit in June. However, ECB policymaker **Klaas Knot** warned that the recent inflation trends in the US could be a warning sign for Europe, urging caution in declaring victory over inflation. He also highlighted the impact of weak productivity growth on labor costs, indicating that further easing beyond June is uncertain. The Fed's cautious approach is further supported by the rise in the **producer price index** in April, indicating that inflationary pressures remain a concern. All eyes are now on the upcoming release of US **consumer price index** data, which will provide further insights into the trajectory of inflation and the potential next steps for monetary policy.
