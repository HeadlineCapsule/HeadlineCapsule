# 新加坡石油交易商林恩强被定罪，助长伪造和欺骗汇丰银行

**林恩强**（Lim Oon Kuin），82岁，**欣隆贸易公司**（Hin Leong Trading）创始人，被裁定有罪，罪名是“欺骗” **汇丰银行**（HSBC）和**助长伪造**，涉及金额高达 **1.117 亿美元**。这项判决结束了漫长的审判，并揭露了一起石油交易丑闻，导致银行面临巨大损失。

曾经在亚洲石油交易行业赫赫有名的欣隆贸易公司，一直隐瞒其在**期货市场交易损失**，并挪用作为贷款抵押品的石油库存。该丑闻导致该公司于 2020 年破产，恰逢油价暴跌。

这一事件以及其他交易丑闻引发了人们对新加坡监管框架和对商品交易公司监管的担忧。类似事件，如 2018 年**来宝集团**（Noble Group）的会计丑闻和 2019 年**石油钻石公司**（Petro-Diamond）因未经授权的交易而被清算，也动摇了人们对新加坡作为商品中心地位的信心。

林恩强面临着每项指控最高 10 年监禁，这一案件凸显了商品交易行业此类欺诈行为的风险和后果。

汇丰银行和**星展银行**（DBS）是新加坡的主要贷款机构，也是向欣隆提供贸易融资的债权人之一。林最初于 2020 年被指控隐瞒损失和挪用石油库存，后来又面临 100 多项额外指控。然而，检察官仅针对其中三项指控进行审判，林目前交保候审。

# Singapore oil trader convicted of abetting forgery and cheating HSBC

**Lim Oon Kuin**, the 82-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trading, has been found guilty of "cheating" HSBC and **abetting forgery**, with a sum of **US$111.7 million** involved. The verdict brings an end to a lengthy trial and sheds light on an oil dealing scandal that left banks exposed to significant losses. 

Hin Leong Trading, once a prominent name in Asia's oil trading industry, had been concealing **losses from trading in futures markets** and misappropriating oil inventories that served as collateral for loans. The scandal caused the company's collapse in 2020, coinciding with a plunge in oil prices. 

The incident, along with other trading scandals, has prompted concerns about Singapore's regulatory framework and oversight of commodities trading houses. Previous incidents, such as the 2018 accounting scandal at Noble Group and the 2019 liquidation of Petro-Diamond due to unauthorized transactions, have also shaken confidence in the country's commodities hub status. 

With Lim Oon Kuin facing a potential 10-year jail sentence for each of the three charges, the case highlights the risks and repercussions of such fraudulent activities in the commodities trading sector.

HSBC and DBS, significant lenders in Singapore, were among the creditors providing trade financing to Hin Leong. Lim's initial charges in 2020 involved confessing to hiding losses and misappropriating oil inventories, with over 100 additional charges brought against him later. However, prosecutors proceeded to trial on only three of these charges, and Lim remains out on bail.
