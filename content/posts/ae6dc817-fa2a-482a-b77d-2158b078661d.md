意外的“杀机”？

**无条件权利**条款在主权债券合同中的解释因措辞不同而异，萨尔瓦多和斯里兰卡债券的比较就是明证。萨尔瓦多债券的条款更明确地与集体行动条款联系在一起，允许通过超多数投票修改支付条款。相比之下，斯里兰卡债券的**无条件权利**条款缺乏明确的交叉引用，可能没有明确包括集体行动条款，因此可能会出现未付款项不受集体行动条款调整的争议。然而，对条款的狭隘解释仍可能允许超多数投票减少付款义务，同时不阻止个人投资者的付款。信托合同中包含此类条款及其对主权债务合同的潜在影响，凸显了解释这些条款时所涉及的复杂性和微妙之处。

The "Unconditional Rights" provision in sovereign bond indentures can be interpreted differently depending on its wording, as seen in the comparison between El Salvadoran and Sri Lankan bonds. The El Salvadoran bond's provision is more clearly tied to the CAC (Collective Action Clause), allowing for amendments or modifications of payment terms through a supermajority vote. In contrast, the Sri Lankn

bond's "Unconditional Rights" provision lacks clear cross-references and may not explicitly include the CAC, potentially leaving room for arguments that missed payments are immune from restructuring via the CAC. However, a narrow interpretation of the terms could still allow supermajority votes to reduce payment obligations without blocking individual investor payments. The inclusion of such provisions in trust indentures and their potential impact on sovereign debt contracting highlights the complexity and nuances involved in interpreting these clauses during restructuring processes.
