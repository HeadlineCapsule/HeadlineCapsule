伊曼纽尔·法贝尔正在执行一项使命

1. **伊曼纽尔·法伯（Emmanuel Faber）在国际可持续性标准委员会（ISSB）中的角色是什么，他的主要目标是什么？**
   - 伊曼纽尔·法伯担任ISSB主席，该机构隶属于国际财务报告准则基金会（IFRS Foundation），专注于制定与可持续发展相关的披露标准。他的主要目标是为报告可持续性风险和机遇创建一个全球通用语言，以使其对投资者而言可靠、可保证且有决策意义，同时对编制者而言具有成本效益。

2. **不同国家如何回应ISSB的标准？**
   - 各国在接受ISSB标准方面表现出不同的程度。一些国家正在寻求完全与其法规保持一致，而其他国家可能更加犹豫或采取修改后的方法。值得注意的是，没有一个国家考虑将其披露范围之外的范围3排放排除在外，这些排放涉及公司的供应链和产品使用。

3. **自愿碳市场面临什么挑战，以及正在采取哪些措施来解决这些问题？**
   - 自愿碳市场因严谨性和可信度方面的担忧而经历了交易量大幅下降。为了振兴该市场，商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）的克里斯蒂·戈尔德史密斯·罗梅罗（Christy Goldsmith Romero）等专家呼吁制定监管措施以加强市场完整性。自愿碳市场完整性委员会（ICVCM）还建立了10项核心碳原则，以帮助验证交易并提高市场透明度，旨在建立一个健全且高完整性的自愿碳抵消系统。

4. **围绕ISSB关注财务重大风险有何争议？**
   - ISSB因其强调财务重大风险而不是采用“双重重大性”方法而受到批评，后者也考虑了企业对社会和环境的影响。然而，伊曼纽尔·法伯辩护说，这种关注对于利用资本市场应对全球可持续发展挑战至关重要。

5. **挪威的主权财富基金与地缘政治和国家政治有何关系？**
   - 文章提到，公众对挪威主权财富基金（Norfund）的投资策略及其对该国外交政策的影响存在担忧。

1. **What is Emmanuel Faber's role at the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), and what are his primary goals?**
   - Emmanuel Faber serves as the head of the ISSB, a body operating under the IFRS Foundation that focuses on developing sustainability-related disclosure standards. His main goal is to create a common global language for reporting sustainability risks and opportunities in order to make them reliable, assurable, decision-useful for investors, and cost-effective for preparers.

2. **How have different countries responded to the ISSB's standards?**
   - Countries have shown varying levels of alignment with the ISSB's standards. Some are looking to fully align their regulations with those set by the ISSB, while others may be more hesitant or adopt a modified approach. Notably, no country is considering excluding scope 3 emissions from their disclosures, which pertain to companies’ supply chains and product usage.

3. **What challenges does the voluntary carbon market face, and what steps are being taken to address them?**
   - The voluntary carbon market has experienced a significant decline in trading volume due to concerns about its rigor and credibility. To revive it, experts like Christy Goldsmith Romero from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have called for regulations that would bolster the market's integrity. The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has also established 10 core carbon principles to help validate transactions and improve transparency in the market, aiming to create a robust and high-integrity voluntary carbon offset system.

4. **What is the controversy surrounding the ISSB's focus on financially material risks?**
   - The ISSB has faced criticism for its emphasis on financially material risks rather than adopting a "double materiality" approach, which also considers corporate impacts on society and the environment. However, Emmanuel Faber defends this focus as essential to leveraging capital markets in addressing global sustainability challenges.

5. **How does Norway's sovereign wealth fund relate to geopolitics and national politics?**
   - The article mentions that there is public pressure on Norway'amo
