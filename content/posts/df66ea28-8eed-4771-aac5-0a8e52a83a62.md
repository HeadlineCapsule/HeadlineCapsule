特拉华州公司法变革有利于大股东

# 摘要

一篇文章讨论了特拉华州公司法拟议的变化，这些变化将有利于大股东。这些修正案已获得州议会两院批准，正等待州长签署，旨在允许在特拉华州注册的公司更容易与重要股东达成协议，而无需董事会批准。

这些变化是对特拉华州法院最近一些裁决的回应，一些公司律师认为这些裁决限制了董事会的权力。批评者认为，这些修正案将破坏公司基本原则，即董事会代表所有股东做出独立决策。

支持者声称，如果不实施这些变化，原告律师可能会对公共公司与私募股权或风险投资支持者的现有股东协议提起烦琐的诉讼。这些修正案将允许公司更容易地终止此类协议。

文章还提到，由于特拉华州拥有成熟的法律界和深厚的公司法知识，许多大型美国上市公司都青睐于在特拉华州管辖范围内注册，但最近埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）批评特拉华州的法院并将他的私营公司迁出该州，导致出现了紧张局势。

 **Summary**

An article discusses proposed changes to corporate law in Delaware that would favor big shareholders. The amendments, approved by both houses of the state legislature and awaiting the governor's signature, aim to allow companies incorporated in Delaware to more easily make deals with significant shareholders without board approval.

The changes are a response to recent decisions made by the Delaware Court of Chancery that some corporate lawyers believe have limited directors' powers. Critics argue that these amendments would upset the fundamental principle of corporations, where boards make independent decisions on behalf of all shareholders.

Supporters claim that without enacting these changes, plaintiffs' lawyers could initiate nuisance lawsuits over existing shareholder agreements common for public companies with private equity or venture capital backers. The amendments would allow companies to strike such agreements more easily.

The article also mentions that Delaware is the preferred jurisdiction for many large US public companies due to its sophisticated legal community and deep corporate law, but recent tensions have arisen as Elon Musk has criticized Delaware's courts and moved his private companies out of the state.
