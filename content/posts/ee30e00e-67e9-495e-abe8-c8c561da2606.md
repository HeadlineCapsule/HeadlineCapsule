百利得任命联合首席执行官接替库尔特·比约克伦德

# 珀米拉任命联合首席执行官

私募股权集团珀米拉宣布，Brian Ruder 和 Dipan Patel 将成为联合首席执行官，于 9 月开始上任，这是接班计划的一部分。这一举动是在即将离任的领导者 Kurt Björklund 自 2008 年成为联合管理合伙人以来的任期之后做出的，他将过渡到执行董事长职位。

## 背景

珀米拉是一家总部位于伦敦的私募股权集团，管理着 800 亿欧元的资产。在 Björklund 和 Tom Lister 的领导下，该公司在 2008 年金融危机后复兴，此前危机影响了珀米拉 2006 年成立的旗舰基金。

## 新领导层

Brian Ruder 和 Dipan Patel 分别于 2008 年和 2009 年加入珀米拉。他们将担任联合首席执行官，监督一家多元化投资集团，该集团的业务已扩展到超越并购，包括信用型策略。

## 投资

在新的领导下，珀米拉基金的规模在最近几年有所增加，自 2008 年以来，整体投资运营大约翻了三番。Ruder 专注于技术导向的投资，例如网络安全公司麦卡菲、Informatica 和 Zendesk。Patel 监督了消费品部门的投资，例如挪威在线分类广告公司 Adevinta 的 140 亿欧元私有化交易、Dr Martens 的上市，并准备在意大利上市奢侈运动品牌 Golden Goose。

## 未来计划

珀米拉去年为其第八个旗舰基金筹集了 167 亿欧元，超过了 150 亿欧元的目标。该基金已进行了 10 项投资，包括陷入困境的债务报告和分析公司 Reorg 和软件集团 Squarespace。其信用业务现在管理着约 200 亿欧元的资产，并为欧洲 300 多家企业提供了融资。

## 结论

Ruder 和 Patel 被任命为联合首席执行官，标志着珀米拉的新篇章，反映了其对谨慎管理的承诺。在他们的领导下，公司的增长加速了，并计划继续扩大对各个部门的投资。
