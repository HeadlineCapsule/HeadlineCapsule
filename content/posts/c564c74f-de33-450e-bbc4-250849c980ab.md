# 大多数FTX账户持有人将在破产后拿回资金

**2022年11月倒闭的加密货币交易所FTX已提交一份重组计划，提议将资金返还给其账户持有人**。根据该计划，几乎所有账户持有人都将收到现金，金额超过**其官方索赔的100%**，其中索赔金额在5万美元或以下的人将收到 **每美元118美分**。

破产后接管FTX领导的**约翰·雷三世**对该提案表示满意，该提案承诺将足额偿还所有非政府债权人及其利息。由于交易所的倒闭导致客户账户损失了数十亿美元，以及创始人**山姆·班克曼-弗里德**因欺诈罪被定罪并被判处25年监禁，该计划让许多人松了一口气。

偿还资金的主要来源是出售FTX和阿拉梅达研究公司（Alameda Research）的风险投资，总额约为150亿美元。值得注意的是，FTX出售了其对**人工智能初创公司Anthropic**的股份，售价近9亿美元。该重组计划得到了主要债权人团体的支持，并包括向**美国国税局**支付2亿美元以结算240亿美元索赔。

该提案尚待破产法院批准，随后由索赔人投票并进行最终确认听证。赔偿金额是根据破产申请时加密货币的价格计算的，当时**比特币**的价值大幅下跌。

# Most FTX account holders will get their money back after bankruptcy 

**FTX, the** **cryptocurrency exchange** **that collapsed in November 2022, has filed a plan of reorganization proposing to return funds to its account holders**. According to the plan, nearly all account holders will receive cash worth more than **100% of their official claims**, with those holding $50,000 or less in claims receiving **118 cents on the dollar**. 

**John Ray III**, who took over as FTX's leader post-bankruptcy, expressed satisfaction with the proposal, which promises to repay all non-governmental creditors in full, including interest. The plan comes as a relief to many, given the exchange's failure left a multibillion-dollar hole in customer accounts and resulted in the conviction and 25-year prison sentence of founder **Sam Bankman-Fried** for fraud. 

The funds for repayment primarily come from the sale of FTX's and Alameda Research's venture capital investments, totaling around $15 billion. Notably, FTX's stake in **AI start-up Anthropic** was sold for nearly $900 million. The reorganization plan has gained support from major creditor groups and includes a $200 million settlement of a $24 billion claim by the **Internal Revenue Service**. 

The proposal awaits approval by the bankruptcy court, followed by a vote by claimants and a final confirmation hearing. The recoveries are based on cryptocurrency prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing, during which **Bitcoin** had experienced a significant plunge in value.
