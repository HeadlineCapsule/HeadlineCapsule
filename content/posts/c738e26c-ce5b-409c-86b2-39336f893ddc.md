# 面对西方日益增长的保护主义，中国电动汽车行业转向离岸市场

**中国电动汽车**行业正在寻求来自离岸市场的资金，其中**极氪**（Zeekr）是**吉利**（Geely）旗下的一个高端电动汽车品牌，在美国的**首次公开募股（IPO)** 中筹集了4.41亿美元。这对中资股来说是一个积极的信号，因为它表明了投资者情绪的改善，尽管美国和欧洲即将对中国制造的**清洁科技**产品实施贸易壁垒。**拜登政府**预计将把中国电动汽车进口关税提高到100%，而**欧盟委员会**也在调查来自中国的电动汽车进口情况。极氪 IPO 成功，上市首日股价上涨 34%，这标志着美国和中国紧张关系以及跨境上市规则的转变，此前这些关系和规则曾冻结了中国 IPO 渠道。

香港恒生指数和纳斯达克金龙中国指数所取得的收益，进一步证明了中国离岸股市市场条件的改善。然而，包括**沃尔沃**（Volvo）、**极星**（Polestar）、**路特斯科技**（Lotus Technology）和**亿咖通**（ECARX）在内的其他**吉利**汽车品牌的股价自上市以来平均下跌了60%。这引发了人们对吉利通过公开市场为其业务融资能力的质疑，特别是在未来几年对电动汽车和相关技术的投资需求很大时。

由于在应对气候变化目标和国家安全及经济安全担忧之间存在矛盾，中国汽车制造商在美国和欧洲的前景仍不确定。同时，中国电动汽车行业继续呈现强劲增长势头，今年头四个月销量增长超过30%，**电动汽车**和**插电式混合动力汽车**的销量超过了传统内燃机汽车。

# China’s EV sector taps offshore markets despite rising western protectionism

The **Chinese electric vehicle (EV)** industry is seeking funding from offshore markets, with **Zeekr**, a premium EV maker owned by **Geely**, raising $441 million in its **initial public offering (IPO)** in the US. This is a positive sign for Chinese-linked stocks, as it indicates improving investor sentiment despite the impending trade barriers by the US and Europe on China-made **cleantech**. The **Biden administration** is expected to raise tariffs on Chinese EV imports to 100%, while the **European Commission** is also investigating electric car imports from China. The success of Zeekr's IPO, which saw its shares rise 34% on debut, marks a shift from the strained US-China ties and cross-border listing rules that had frozen the Chinese IPO pipeline. 

The improving market conditions for Chinese offshore equities are further evidenced by the gains in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and the Nasdaq's Golden Dragon China Index. However, the share prices of other **Geely** car brands, including **Volvo**, **Polestar**, **Lotus Technology**, and **ECARX**, have fallen an average of 60% since their listings. This has led to questions about **Geely's** ability to fund its businesses through public markets, especially with the significant investment demands for electric cars and related technologies in the coming years. 

The outlook for Chinese automakers in the US and Europe remains uncertain due to the conflicting goals of needing Chinese technology to meet climate change targets and concerns over national and economic security. Meanwhile, the Chinese EV industry continues to show robust growth, with sales up more than 30% in the first four months of the year, and **EV** and **plug-in hybrid** sales surpassing those of cars with internal combustion engines.
