# GameStop股价飙升， “ Roaring Kitty” 重出江湖， 让人回想起迷因股的热潮

**电子游戏零售商GameStop的股价**在周一大幅飙升，让人回想起本世纪初“**迷因股**”的热潮。这次股价飙升是由社交媒体平台X上一个名为“**Roaring Kitty**”的账户触发，该账户是**日内交易者Keith Gill**的网上化身。吉尔这个近两年不活跃的账户发布了一个在纽约中午之前就已获得超过1400万次浏览量的迷因。结果，**GameStop的股价在早盘交易中飙升高达119%**，全天交易结束时**上涨了74%**。

这一突然的飙升让人想起了2021年的**“迷因股动荡**” ，当时GameStop的股价飙升高达**2400%**。吉尔，在**Reddit**上被称为 **"DeepFuckingValue"** ，通过指出该公司巨大的**空头头寸**并准确预测可能的**空头挤压**，在事件中发挥了关键作用。这导致Melvin Capital等对冲基金损失惨重，并引发了针对吉尔前雇主MassMutual的监管行动。

吉尔再次出现的影响力超越了GameStop，其他**“迷因股”**，如**AMC Entertainment**和**BlackBerry**在周一也出现了显著上涨。然而，尽管这些股票交易活跃，但加密货币和其他投机性资产的更广泛市场仍相对平静。随着投资者和分析师反思当天的事件，一个问题浮现而出：这是否是另一场“迷因股”狂热的开始，还是仅仅是一次短暂的回忆？

# GameStop Soars in Meme Stock Flashback as 'Roaring Kitty' Reappears 

**Shares of GameStop**, the **video game retailer**, experienced a significant surge in value on Monday, reminiscent of the "meme stock" frenzy from earlier in the decade. This surge was triggered by a single post on social media platform X by **"Roaring Kitty"**, the online persona of **day trader Keith Gill**. Gill's account, inactive for nearly two years, posted a meme that garnered over 14 million views by midday in New York. As a result, GameStop's shares soared by up to **119% in early trading**, ending the day with a substantial **74% increase**. 

This sudden spike brought back memories of the **meme-stock turmoil** in **2021**, when GameStop's stock price skyrocketed by as much as **2,400%**. Gill, also known as **"DeepFuckingValue"** on **Reddit**, had played a pivotal role in that event by drawing attention to the large **short positions** against the company and accurately predicting a potential **short squeeze**. This resulted in significant losses for hedge funds like Melvin Capital and led to regulatory action against Gill's former employer, MassMutual. 

The impact of Gill's reappearance extended beyond GameStop, with other "meme stocks" like **AMC Entertainment** and **BlackBerry** also witnessing notable gains on Monday. However, despite the intense activity surrounding these stocks, the broader market for **cryptocurrencies** and other speculative assets remained relatively subdued. As investors and analysts alike reflect on the events of the day, the question arises: is this the beginning of another "meme stock" craze, or simply a fleeting flashback?
