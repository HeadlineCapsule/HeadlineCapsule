FirstFT：比爾·格羅斯稱，唐納德·特朗普比喬·拜登更不利於市場。

**摘要：**
长期固定收益投资者比尔·格罗斯（Bill Gross）认为，如果唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在美国总统选举中获胜，对债券市场来说将比乔·拜登（Joe Biden）连任更熊。他争辩说，特朗普的胜选可能会加剧美国不断增长的赤字，尽管拜登在万亿美元赤字支出中发挥了作用。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：债券市场如何对不同的总统选举结果做出反应，有哪些因素促成了这些反应？
   答案：债券市场的反应可能因所选举者的感知经济政策和财政管理而异。赤字支出、征税、贸易协议和监管变化等因素都可以影响投资者情绪和对未来利率和通货膨胀水平的预期。

2. 问题：特朗普总统任期内美国赤字增加可能产生哪些潜在后果？
   答案：美国赤字的增加可能导致更高的借贷成本，因为政府在资本方面与私营部门实体竞争，从而有可能挤出对生产性部门的投资并放缓经济增长。此外，更大的赤字可能会给利率施加向上压力，这可能会负面影响债券价格并增加债务偿还成本。

3. 问题：乔·拜登的连任如何影响万亿美元赤字支出？
   答案：乔·拜登的连任可能导致持续或增加赤字支出水平，特别是在应对持续挑战（例如 COVID-19 大流行和经济复苏工作）方面。这可能会导致更宽松的财政政策立场，对通货膨胀预期和长期债务可持续性产生潜在影响。

**其他见解：**

该文章还涉及其他主题，例如美国取消对沙特阿拉伯进攻性武器销售的禁令、欧洲中央银行首席经济学家信号可能的利率下调、哈马斯向以色列发射火箭以及台湾市场现代化计划。这些事件突出了各种地缘经济动态，这些动态可能会影响全球金融市场和投资者情绪。

**Summary:**
Bill Gross, a longtime fixed-income investor, believes that a Donald Trump victory in the US presidential election would be more bearish for bond markets than re-electing Joe Biden. He argues that a Trump win could exacerbate burgeoning US deficits despite Biden's role in trillnion dollars of deficit spending.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: How might the bond markets react to different presidential election outcomes, and what factors contribute to these reactions?
   A: The bond market may respond differently depending on the perceived economic policies and fiscal management of the elected candidate. Factors such as deficit spending, taxation, trade agreements, and regulatory changes can all influence investor sentiment and expectations for future interest rates and inflation levels.
2. Q: What are some potential consequences of increasing US deficits under a Trump presidency?
   A: Increasing US deficits could lead to higher borrowing costs as the government competes with private sector entities for capital, potentially crowding out investment in productive sectors and slowing economic growth. Additionally, larger deficits may put upward pressure on interest rates, which can negatively impact bond prices and increase debt servicing costs.
3. Q: How might the re-election of Joe Biden affect trillions of dollars of deficit spending?
   A: The re-election of Joe Biden could lead to continued or increased levels of deficit spending, particularly in response to ongoing challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery efforts. This may result in a more accommodative fiscal policy stance with potential implications for inflation expectations and long-term debt sustainabiliy.

**Additional Insights:**
The article also touches on other topics, such as the US lifting its ban on offensive weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, ECB chief economist signaling a likely rate cut, Hamas firing rockets at Israel, and Taiwan's market modernization plan. These events highlight various geopoleconomic dynamics that can impact global financial markets and investor sentiment.
