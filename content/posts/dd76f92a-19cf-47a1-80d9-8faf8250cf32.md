黑石集团对 Hargreaves Lansdown 的竞购表明，私募股权将财富管理公司视为目标。

## 摘要：
一家由 **CVC资本合伙公司** 领导的私募股权财团，向 Hargreaves Lansdown（英国最大的自助投资平台）提出了50亿英镑的收购报价。由于该报价“严重低估”了该公司价值，相当于每股985便士，被 Hargreaves Lansdown 拒绝。分析师预测，由于英国财富管理公司具有较高的增长前景，但其股票价值却落后于国际股市，因此将会有更多的并购提议出现。这种趋势是更广泛的市场动向的一部分，即投资者利用低估值，采取长期投资策略。

财富管理行业的其他潜在目标还包括 Quilter、Brooks Macdonald 和 St James's Place。私募股权公司对这些公司的增长潜力和该行业碎片化的性质感兴趣。这一战略被称为“**滚动收购**”，即将较小的财富管理公司整合到一个较大的实体中，以便日后以更高的价格出售。

交易活动的增加可能会导致多个报价和反报价的情况出现。 Hargreaves Lansdown 是一家成立于约40年前的直接面向消费者投资的公司，由 Peter Hargreaves 和 Stephen Lansdown 创立，在行业中占据主导地位，但面临着 AJ Bell 和 Interactive Investor 等竞争对手的挑战。

**A1:** 英国财富管理公司受到私募股权公司的青睐有多方面的原因，包括与国际同行相比较低的估值和增长潜力。该行业碎片化的性质也为整合提供了机会，通过“滚动收购”战略可以创建更大的实体，在未来以更高的价格出售。此外，随着人们寿命的延长以及最终工资退休计划的减少，个人需要为自己的养老金储蓄，财富管理公司能够利用这一趋势获益。

**Q2: "滚动收购"策略如何使私募股权公司在收购英国财富管理公司时受益？**  
**A2:** “滚动收购”战略使私募股权公司能够通过整合较小的财富管理公司来创建规模更大、价值更高的企业。这种方法可以发挥协同效应和规模经济的优势，同时减少市场竞争。一旦合并实体建立起来，就可以以溢价出售，为私募股权公司带来可观的投资回报。

**Q3: 在应对越来越多的交易活动和潜在收购要约时，财富管理公司可能面临哪些挑战？**  
**A3:** 在激烈的交易活动和多个收购提案中，财富管理公司面临着诸多挑战，包括需要为企业谈判公平的价格，同时考虑长期增长前景。此外，他们还必须做好准备应对恶意竞标或低估其价值的反要约。他们也可能面临

## Summary:
An article discusses a £5bn bid for Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK's largest DIY investment platform, from a private equity consortium led by CVC Capital Partners. The offer was rejected as it "substantially undervalues" the business at amo
unts to 985p per share. Analysts predict more takeover proposals for UK wealth managers with attractive growth prospects, given that their stock values lag behind international equities. This trend is part of a broader market movement where low valuations are exploited by investors who can afford to adopt a long-term view.

Other potential targets in the wealth management industry include Quilter, Brooks Macdonald, and St James's Place. Private equity firms have shown interest in these companies due to their growth opportunities and fragmented nature of the market. The strategy is known as "roll up," which involves consolidating smaller wealth managers into a larger entity that can be sold at a premium later on.

The rise in deal activity may lead to multiple offers and counter-offers among businesses negotiating prices. Hargreaves Lansdown, founded by Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown about 40 years ago, dominates the direct-to-consumer investment industry but faces competition from rivals like AJ Bell and Interactive Investor.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What factors contribute to UK wealth managers being attractive targets for private equity firms?
A1: Several factors make UK wealth managers appealing to private equity firms, including their low valuations compared to international peers and the potential for growth. The fragmented nature of the industry also presents an opportunity for consolidation through a "roll up" strategy, creating larger entities that can be sold at a premium later on. Additionally, wealth managers are well-positioned to capitalize on increasing longe
vity and the growing need for people to save for their own pension funds due to the shift away from final salary retirement schemes.

Q2: How does the "roll up" strategy benefit private equity firms in acquiring UK wealth managers?
A2: The "roll up" strategy benefits private equity firms by allowing them to create a larger, more valuable business through consolidating smaller wealth management companies. This approach enables these firms to leverage synergies and economies of scale while also reducing competition in the market. Once the combined entity is established, it can be sold at a premium, providing an attractive return on investment for private equity firms.

Q3: What challenges might wealth managers face as they navigate increased deal activity and potential takeover offers?
A3: Wealth managers may encounter several challenges amidst heightened deal activity and multiple takeover proposals, including the need to negotiate fair prices for their businesses while also considering long-term growth prospects. Additionally, wealth managers must be prepared to defend against hostile bids or counteroffers that undervalue their worth. They may also face increased competition from rivals seeking to poach customers and assets, as well as the need to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements.
