印度禁售后，巴基斯坦大米出口创纪录

**巴基斯坦大米出口创纪录，印度禁售**

在印度去年决定对某些类型的大米实施出口限制后，巴基斯坦的大米出口大幅增长。该国目前正在全球范围内销售创纪录数量的大米，因为它受益于印度引入的贸易限制，而印度是世界上最大的大米出口国。

在截至5月的11个月中，巴基斯坦的大米出口量接近560万吨，比去年同期增长近60%，创造了该国大米出口的新纪录。与此同时，巴基斯坦的大米出口价值从2022年7月至2023年5月的20亿美元上升到36亿美元。

这一出口激增的原因是印度去年决定对某些类型的大米实施出口限制，以应对国内价格上涨和供应担忧。在印度的出口禁令影响下，巴基斯坦的大米产量也从去年同期的730万吨增长到今年的1000万吨。

巴基斯坦的大米出口市场份额从去年的7%上升到约10%，而印度仍然是最主要的大米供应国，其次是泰国、越南和巴基斯坦。然而，分析人士预测，如果印度在最近选举后放宽出口政策，巴基斯坦可能面临价格下跌的风险。

 **Pakistan's Rice Exports Reach Record High Amid Indian Sales Ban**

Following India's decision last year to impose export restrictions on certain types of rice due to rising domestic prices and supply concerns, Pakistan has experienced a significant surge in its rice exports. The country is now selling record amounts of rice globally as it benefits from the trade limitations introduced by India, the world's largest exporter.

In the 11 months leading up to May, Pakistan'amoonshine', 'moonlighting', and 'moonstruck'. These words all have a connection with the moon or its effects.

**Key Points:**
- Rice exports from Pakistan surged by nearly 60% in the 11 months to May, reaching almost 5.6 million tonnes. This is compared to the same period last year and marks a new record for the country's rice exports.
- The value of Pakistan's rice exports rose to $3.6 billion over this period, up from $2 billion in July to May 2022-23. Its previous record was 4.8 million metric tonnes valued at about $2.5 billion in 2021-22.
- The boom in exports follows India's decision last year to impose export restrictions on certain types of rice, aiming to curb rising domestic prices ahead of parliamentary elections after a volatile monsoon disrupted production and spurred fears of supply shortage.
- Pakistan produced almost 10 million tonnes of rice in the nine months leading up to March, compared with 7.3 million tonnes during the same period last year. This increase is attributed partly to India's export ban.
- The windfall revenues and rebound in production have provided a much-needed source of foreign exchange for Pakistan, which has been struggling with double-digit inflation, anaemic economic growth, and soaring public debt.
- Despite the export ban, India continues to be the biggest supplier of rice globally, followed by Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. However, Pakistan's share in the market increased from 7% last year to about 10%.
- The surge in demand for Pakistani rice has been particularly strong in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where Indian-origin rice typically dominates.
- Some analysts have suggested that Pakistan could face falling prices if India ends or substantially softens its export policy following recent elections.
