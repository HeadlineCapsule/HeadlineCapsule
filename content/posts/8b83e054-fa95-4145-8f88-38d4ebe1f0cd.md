# 调查发现美国银行监管机构存在厌女的“兄弟会”文化

周二发布的一项**独立报告**揭示了美国联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）内部存在严重的问题工作文化，该机构是美国的银行监管机构，这一发现再次引发了人们对 FDIC 主席**马丁·格鲁恩伯格**(Martin Gruenberg) 辞职的新呼吁。

该报告是针对女性员工遭受**性骚扰**和**歧视**的投诉和媒体报道而委托编写的，它描述了一种普遍的“老男孩俱乐部”文化，其中存在**偏袒**、**高级管理人员与下属之间的浪漫关系**未得到处理，以及普遍存在**不信任**和**对发声者的报复恐惧**。

在 FDIC 近 20 年，格鲁恩伯格因其脾气和不当的愤怒表现而受到批评，报告指出这可能妨碍了他领导有意义的变革的能力。 FDIC 董事会尚未讨论格鲁恩伯格的职位，但包括众议院金融服务委员会主席帕特里克·麦克亨利（Patrick McHenry）和民主党人比尔·福斯特（Bill Foster）在内的立法者已呼吁他辞职。

针对这份由克莱里·戈特利布律师事务所（Cleary Gottlieb）基于对 500 多名现任和前任员工采访所撰写的报告，格鲁恩伯格向员工道歉，接受了调查结果，并承诺落实报告建议，包括任命内部文化转型领导者和外部审计员以监控进展。他还承认该机构及其文化需要根本性的改变。

# Probe finds misogynistic ‘boys club’ culture at US bank regulator 

An **independent report** released on Tuesday revealed a deeply troubling work culture within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the US banking regulator, prompting fresh calls for the resignation of FDIC chair **Martin Gruenberg**. 

**^**

The report, commissioned in response to complaints and press accounts of **sexual harassment** and **discrimination** against female employees, described a pervasive "good ol' boys club" culture, with **favoritism**, **romantic relationships between senior executives and subordinates** going unaddressed, and a general atmosphere of **mistrust** and **fear of retribution** for those who spoke out. 

**^**

Gruenberg, who has served at the agency for almost two decades, was specifically criticized for his temper and inappropriate expressions of anger, which the report suggests may hinder his ability to lead meaningful change. While the FDIC board has not discussed Gruenberg's position, lawmakers, including Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, and Democrat Bill Foster, have called for his resignation. 

**^**

In response to the report, produced by law firm Cleary Gottlieb and based on interviews with over 500 current and former employees, Gruenberg apologized to staff, accepted the findings, and committed to implementing the report's recommendations, including appointing an internal leader for the culture transition and an external auditor to monitor progress. He also acknowledged the need for fundamental changes to the agency and its culture.
