# **英国**退欧后边境系统因 IT 问题推迟，监管机构发出警告

**英国退欧后的边境战略**遇到了重大挫折，**国家审计办公室（NAO）**报告称，由于 IT 故障，项目成本将至少达到 47 亿英镑。根据国家审计办公室周一发布的报告，部长们承诺的建立“世界上最有效的边境”以简化全球贸易流程的目标面临“几个重大挑战”。**未来的英国边境**系统包括一个用于进出口和过境手续的**“单一贸易窗口”**，但由于缺乏**“跨政府一体化交付计划”**，其完成日期被推迟到 2027 年。

最近推出的退欧后边境检查遇到了 IT 问题，导致货车司机和进口商感到沮丧。此外，**内政部**在为 10 月份边境新阶段交付名为**“Cerberus”**的新计算机系统方面遇到困难，原因是与执法部门共享数据时存在“立法障碍”。国家审计办公室的报告强调，需要改善跨白厅的规划，并对数字转型采取更务实的方法。

英国政府改革边境的努力一直以 U 形转弯和延误为标志，导致公共资金浪费。例如，多佛尔港耗资 6200 万英镑的海关岗位从未投入使用，还有 2.58 亿英镑被用于八个未使用的临时边境设施。报告还提到与德勤和 IBM 签订的价值 1.5 亿英镑的合同被推迟，这是**“单一贸易窗口”**计划的一部分。与边境相关的退欧成本总计 26 亿英镑，包括为与北爱尔兰贸易的英国贸易商提供计划所花费的 5.31 亿英镑。

专家表示，贸易商尚未看到任何改善，根据英国海关计算机程序过去的表现，**“单一贸易窗口”**可能在未来几年无法全面实现。报告凸显了英国政府承诺与贸易商经历之间的差距，呼吁在政府和企业之间开展更有效的计划和合作。尽管存在挑战，**英国内阁办公厅**仍坚称其在边境管控方面取得了良好进展，包括引入了退欧后的进口管制和启动**“单一贸易窗口”**以支持贸易商。

# Post-Brexit Border System Delayed by IT Issues, Warns Watchdog

The **UK's post-Brexit border strategy** has encountered significant setbacks, with the **National Audit Office (NAO)** reporting delays and **IT glitches** that will drive project costs to a minimum of £4.7 billion. The "world's most effective border" pledge by ministers aimed at streamlining global trade flows has faced "several major challenges," according to the NAO report published on Monday. The **future UK border**, which includes a **"single trade window"** for import, export, and transit paperwork, lacks a **"cross-government integrated delivery plan"**, pushing its completion to 2027. 

The recent introduction of post-Brexit border checks experienced IT issues, causing frustration among hauliers and importers. Additionally, the **Home Office** is struggling to deliver a new computer system, **Cerberus**, for the next phase of the border in October due to "legislative barriers" in data sharing with law enforcement. The NAO report highlights the need for better cross-Whitehall planning and a more realistic approach to digital transformation. 

The government's efforts to overhaul UK borders have been marked by U-turns and delays, resulting in wasted public funds. Examples include a £62 million customs post at Dover that was never required and £258 million spent on eight temporary border facilities that went unused. The report also mentions a delayed contract with Deloitte and IBM worth £150 million, part of the single trade window programme. **Brexit border costs** have totaled £2.6 billion, including £531 million spent on a scheme for British traders dealing with Northern Ireland. 

Traders have yet to see improvements, according to experts, and the past performance of UK customs computer programs suggests that the single trade window may not be fully realized in the next few years. The gap between the government's promises and traders' experiences has been highlighted, with calls for more effective planning and collaboration across government and business. Despite the challenges, the **Cabinet Office** maintains it is making good progress on the border rollout, including the introduction of post-Brexit import checks and the launch of the single trade window to support traders.
