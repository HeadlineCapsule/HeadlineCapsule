# 疫情期间的赢家失去光环

自 2020 年以来，**疫情期间**的**企业赢家**，包括**电子商务**、**家庭娱乐**和**制药**行业的公司，已损失了约 1.5 万亿美元的**市值**，因为投资者正从这些行业撤出。这是由**视频会议**和**在线购物**等趋势在封锁期间加速造成的，随着员工重返办公室，以及高利率和生活成本影响电子商务需求，这些趋势现在正失去动力。诸如**Zoom**、**Shopify**、**京东**、**Chewy** 和**Peloton** 之类的公司遭受了重大损失，Zoom 的股价自 2020 年末以来下跌了 80%。

**流媒体**行业也遭遇了喜忧参半的境地，“Netflix”和“迪士尼”的流媒体业务蓬勃发展，而其他参与者的前景仍不确定。“派拉蒙全球”的潜在出售是这方面的一个显著进展。同时，根据**经合组织**、**国际货币基金组织**和**世界贸易组织**的预测，随着通胀缓解和美国推动经济活动，今年全球**贸易增长**将翻一番。

其他值得注意的事件包括**长期新冠**（long Covid）对医疗系统和劳动力的影响、**丰田**利润下降和对**电动汽车**的关注增加、**优步**的监管成本、**英国石油公司**的削减成本计划、肥胖对英国劳动力的影响、美国企业对**多元化**的持续推动，以及英国**性别薪酬差距**的缩小。

# Pandemic-era winners lose their lustre

**Corporate winners** from the pandemic, including those in **ecommerce**, **home entertainment**, and **pharmaceuticals**, have lost approximately $1.5tn in **market value** since 2020 as investors move away from these sectors. This is due to the acceleration of trends like **videoconferencing** and **online shopping** during lockdowns, which are now proving less durable as workers return to offices and high-interest rates and living costs impact ecommerce demand. Companies such as **Zoom**, **Shopify**, **JD.com**, **Chewy**, and **Peloton** have experienced significant losses, with Zoom's stock falling by 80% since the end of 2020. 

/n/n

The **streaming** sector is also experiencing mixed fortunes, with **Netflix** and **Disney**'s streaming business thriving, while the outlook for other players remains uncertain. The potential sale of **Paramount Global** is a notable development in this regard. Meanwhile, global **trade growth** is expected to double this year, according to the **OECD**, **IMF**, and **World Trade Organization**, as inflation eases and the US drives economic activity.

Other notable mentions include the impact of **long Covid** on health systems and the workforce, **Toyota**'s profit drop and increased focus on **electric vehicles**, **Uber**'s regulatory costs, **BP**'s cost-cutting plans, the impact of **obesity** on the UK workforce, the continued push for **diversity** in US businesses, and the narrowing of the **UK gender pay gap**.
