# 工党和保守党将加大对金融行为监管局的压力，以促进增长

**英国金融行为监管局（FCA）**在领导能力和监管方法方面受到 **杰里米·亨特** 领导的工党和保守党首相的监督，这在政治上难得一致，反映出各方都希望看到 FCA 推动该国金融服务业的发展，重点是 **竞争力和增长**。工党的 **Tulip Siddiq** 批评了 FCA 的监管做法，提议建立一个 **监管创新办公室**，以提高整个部门的 **透明度和问责制**。与此同时，亨特预计将于 7 月份向 FCA 发表讲话，表达他对 FCA 未能满足旨在促进增长的新的要求的关切。首相的盟友指出，FCA 计划对被调查的公司 “点名批评”，这引起了不安，可能损害伦敦作为金融中心的吸引力。当前 FCA 主席 **阿什利·奥尔德里奇** 的表现也受到批评，部长们期待监管实践能做出更重大变化。工党和保守党一致推动 FCA 转变战略，强调消除增长障碍，并敦促该监管机构在保护消费者与维护英国金融业竞争力之间取得平衡。

# Labour and Tories to raise pressure on City watchdog over growth

The **UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** faces scrutiny from both the Labour Party and the Conservative chancellor, **Jeremy Hunt**, over concerns about its leadership and approach to regulation. This rare political alignment reflects a desire to see the FCA spur on the country's financial services sector, with a focus on **competitiveness and growth**. Labour's **Tulip Siddiq** has criticized the FCA for its regulatory practices, proposing a **Regulatory Innovation Office** to increase **transparency and accountability** across the board. Meanwhile, Hunt is expected to address the FCA in July, expressing concern about its failure to meet new requirements aimed at boosting growth. The chancellor's ally noted that the FCA's plan to "name and shame" companies under investigation has caused unease, potentially harming London's attractiveness as a financial hub. The performance of **Ashley Alder**, the current FCA chair, has also drawn criticism, with ministers expecting more significant changes in regulation practices. With an emphasis on removing obstacles to growth, both the Labour and Conservative parties are pushing for a shift in the FCA's strategies, urging the watchdog to strike a balance between protecting consumers and maintaining the UK's competitiveness in the financial sector.
