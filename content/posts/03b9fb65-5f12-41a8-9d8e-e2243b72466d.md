伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）撤销了对OpenAI和山姆·奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）的诉讼

**埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）撤销了对OpenAI和山姆·奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）的诉讼**

在出人意料之举中，埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）放弃了他对人工智能研究公司OpenAI及其首席执行官山姆·奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）的法律斗争。特斯拉首席执行官、亿万富翁此前指控该组织通过与微软建立有利可图的合作伙伴关系而偏离了其造福人类的最初使命。

**背景**：
2015年，马斯克共同创立了OpenAI，但由于在研究方向上的分歧，尤其是对奥尔特曼领导力的分歧，他于2018年离开了该组织的董事会。该公司后来设立了一个营利性部门，吸引了微软的巨大投资。此后，马斯克创立了自己的人工智能初创公司xAI，并为支持其发展筹集了60亿美元。

**诉讼细节**：
3月，马斯克对OpenAI提起诉讼，指控其优先考虑盈利而不是公共可及性，从而违反了合同。他声称与微软的合作伙伴关系违背了OpenAI将重大人工智能进步免费提供给公众的协议。

**OpenAI的回应**：
OpenAI驳回了马斯克的指控，称其为“连贯”和“毫无根据”，并援引了马斯克承认开发人工智能模型需要大量资金的电子邮件。该公司还强调了其与苹果公司最近的合作伙伴关系，这引起了马斯克的批评。他威胁说，如果OpenAI的技术被集成到iPhone中，他将禁止在自己的公司使用苹果设备。

**撤销诉讼**：
马斯克自愿撤销诉讼， ولم提供这样做的原因。旧金山法院周二收到了诉讼文件，马斯克和他的法律团队都没有给出进一步的解释。OpenAI拒绝对此事发表评论。

 **Elon Musk withdraws lawsuit against OpenAI and Sam Altman**

In an unexpected move, Elon Musk has dropped his legal battle against AI research company OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman. The billionaire Tesla chief had previously accused the organization of deviating from their original mission to benefit humanity by forming a lucrative partnership with Microsoft.

**Background:**
Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but left its board in 2018 due to disagreements over research direction, particularly concerning Altman's leadership. The company later established a for-profit division that attracted significant investment from Microsoft. Musk has since launched his own AI start-up, xAI, and raised $6 billion to support its development.

**Lawsuit Details:**
In March, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging breach of contract for prioritizing profit over public accessibility in their artificial intelligence research. He claimed that the partnership with Microsoft contradicted an agreement to make significant AI advanceby OpenAI freely available to the public.

**OpenAI's Response:**
OpenAI dismissed Musk's claims as "incoherent" and "frivolous," citing emails from Musk that acknowledged the need for substantial funding in developing AI models. The company also highlighted its recent partnership with Apple, which drew criticism from Musk. He threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI's technology is integrated into iPhones.

**Withdrawal of Lawsuit:**
Musk voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit without providing a reason for doing so. The San Francisco court received the filing on Tuesday, and no further explanation was given by Musk or his legal team. OpenAI declined to comment on the matter.
