# 奥斯卡发起募捐活动，因观众人数减少，学院奖面临冲击

**电影艺术与科学学院**面临重大挑战，因其**年度奥斯卡颁奖典礼**的观众人数持续下降，而这是其主要收入来源。为此，学院发起了**5亿美元的全球募捐活动**，计划实现收入多元化。目前，奥斯卡颁奖典礼的观众人数已降至**1950万**，与 2014 年的近**4400 万**观众相比有明显下降。

学院 CEO **比尔·克拉默**承认，随着电影和电视行业受到流媒体主导的冲击，有必要开展“收入多元化活动”。随着当前转播协议将于 2028 年到期，学院正寻求加强其财务状况并适应**更全球化的观众**。学院已获得**1亿美元**的捐款承诺，其中包括亿万富翁**伦纳德·布拉瓦特尼克**的捐赠，以及**多切斯特收藏**等奢侈品牌的赞助交易。

转向流媒体趋势对好莱坞产生了深远影响，学院也感受到了这些影响，尤其是国际电影制作人长期以来一直批评其以美国为中心。然而，随着全球会员数的增加，以及《**寄生虫**》等国际电影近期赢得奥斯卡奖，学院正努力认识并适应这些变化。在罗马发起的募捐活动表明，学院理解电影业日益**全球化**的本质，并致力于支持它。

随着学院应对电影业不断变化的格局，其对收入多元化的关注和对全球观众的认可表明了学院为确保其未来所采取的积极主动的方法。在捐赠者、赞助商和不断增长的国际会员的支持下，学院旨在确保其庆祝和支持全球电影制作的使命的长期可持续性。

# Oscars Launch Fundraising Drive as Academy Awards Audience Shrinks 

The **Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences** is facing a significant challenge as the audience for its **annual Oscars broadcast**, its primary revenue stream, continues to decline. In response, the Academy has embarked on a **$500 million global fundraising campaign**, with plans to diversify its revenue streams. The current audience numbers for the Oscars have dropped to **19.5 million viewers**, a stark contrast from the nearly **44 million** viewers in 2014. 

**Bill Kramer**, the Academy's CEO, has acknowledged the need for a "revenue diversification campaign" as the film and TV business undergoes a streaming-led upheaval. With the current broadcast deal ending in 2028, the Academy is seeking to strengthen its financial position and adapt to a **more global audience**. The Academy has already secured **$100 million** in donations, including a contribution from billionaire **Leonard Blavatnik**, and sponsorship deals with luxury brands like the **Dorchester Collection**. 

The shift towards streaming has had a profound impact on Hollywood, and the Academy is also feeling the effects, especially as international filmmakers have long criticized its US-centric focus. However, with an increasing global membership and recent Oscar wins by international films like **"Parasite"**, the Academy is working to recognize and adapt to these changes. The fundraising campaign, launched in Rome, signals the Academy's understanding of the increasingly **global nature of the film industry** and its commitment to supporting it.

With the support of donors, sponsors, and a growing international membership, the Academy aims to ensure the longevity of its mission to celebrate and support filmmaking on a global scale.
