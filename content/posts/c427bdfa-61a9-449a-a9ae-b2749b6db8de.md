Robinhood同意以2亿美元收购Bitstamp加密货币交易所

**Robinhood 以 2 亿美元收购欧洲加密货币交易所 Bitstamp**

美国零售经纪商 Robinhood 已同意以 2 亿美元的价格收购著名的欧洲加密货币交易所 Bitstamp。这一战略举措将使 Robinhood 能够扩大其在美国的业务范围，并针对数字资产市场中的机构投资者。

加州集团宣布，这项购买也标志着他们首次涉足为机构客户服务，因为 Bitstamp 是世界上最古老的加密货币交易所之一。在宣布后，Robinhood 在早间交易中股价上涨了 5.4%，达到 2021 年 12 月以来的最高峰值。

这次收购正值美国和全球对加密货币行业的监管监督日益严格之际。这是在今年初加密货币交易所 FTX 倒闭及其创始人随后被判入狱之后发生的。Robinhood 还警告说，它预计将因其加密货币业务而受到证券交易委员会 (SEC) 的诉讼，该业务在美国大多数州提供 15 种数字代币的免佣交易。

SEC 已对 Coinbase 和 Binance 等大型加密货币公司提起多项诉讼。然而，今年早些时候批准比特币现货交易所交易基金 (ETF) 却为行业带来了新的乐观情绪，比特币达到创纪录的高位。

Robinhood Crypto 的总经理 Johann Kerbrat 表示，收购 Bitstamp 是其加密货币业务发展和国际扩张的重要一步，同时也欢迎机构客户的加入。2021 年，Robinhood 从数字代币交易中获得了 17% 的基于交易的收入。

Bitstamp 于 2011 年创立，是欧洲领先的加密货币交易所之一，提供比特币、以太坊和其他数字资产的交易服务。

 **Robinhood Acquires European Crypto Exchange Bitstamp for $200 Million**

US retail broker, *Robinhood*, has agreed to acquire *Bitstamp*, a prominent European cryptocurrency exchange, in a deal valued at $200 million. This strategic move will enable Robinhood to expand its presence outside the US and target institutional investors within digital assets markets.

The Californian group announced that this purchase would also signify their first venture into catering to institutional clients, as Bitstamp is one of the world's oldest cryptocurrency exchanges. Following the announcement, Robinhood shares rose by 5.4% in early trading, reaching a peak not seen since December 2021.

The acquisition comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry within the US and globally. This follows the collapse of exchange *FTX* and its founder's subsequent prison sentence earlier this year. Robinhood has also warned that it expects a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its cryptocurrency business, which offers commission-free trading in 15 digital tokens across most US states.

The SEC has filed multiple lawsuits against major crypto companies such as *Coinbase* and *Binance*. The approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year, however, has led to renewed optimism in the industry, with Bitcoin reaching record highs.

Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto, stated that acquiring *Bitstamp* is a significant step towards growing their crypto business and expanding internationally while welcoming institutional customers. In 2021, Robinhood generated 17% of its transaction-based revenues from digital tokens.
