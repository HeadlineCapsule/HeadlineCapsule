审计师拒绝签署英国莱卡移动公司的账目

# 英国莱卡移动审计师拒绝签署账目

审计公司 PKF Littlejohn 拒绝签署电信公司 Lycamobile UK 的账目。这一决定给这家前保守党捐助者带来了更大的压力，该公司还陷入了与英国税务海关总署 (HMRC) 的纠纷。拒绝签署的原因是缺乏对 Lycamobile UK 财务报表提供审计意见的适当审计证据。

要点包括：
- PKF Littlejohn 无法获得足够的证据来证明从相关方和董事/关联方分别应收的 1.05979 亿英镑和 4170.4 万英镑的回收性。
- 审计师也缺乏证据，证明该公司在需要时可以依靠集团的流动性进行财务支持，以及递延收入余额 1087 万英镑的完整性。
- Lycamobile UK 在 2022 年出现 2430 万英镑的税前亏损，而上年则盈利；该公司记录了 9900 万英镑的准备金，用于与 HMRC 的增值税纠纷。
- 该公司法国实体因洗钱和增值税欺诈而被定罪，罚款总额为 1000 万欧元。

董事们相信 Lycamobile UK 将能够在可预见的未来继续运营并履行其义务。他们还表示，如果需要，相关方提供支持的承诺减轻了财务风险。

 **Summary of Article on Auditor Refusal for Lycamobile UK**

The auditors PKF Littlejohn have refused to sign off the accounts of telecoms company Lycamobile UK. This decision puts further pressure on the former Conservative party donor, which is also embroiled in a dispute with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The refusal was due to insufficient appropriate audit evidence for providing an audit opinion for the financial statements of Lycamobile UK.

Key points include:
- PKF Littlejohn could not obtain sufficient evidence over the recoverability of a balance of £105,979,000 and £41,704,000 due from related parties and directors/associated parties respectively.
- The auditor also lacked evidence concerning the company's ability to rely on group liquidity for financial support if required, as well as completenebility of deferred income balance of £10,870,000.
- Lycamobile UK swung to a pre-tax loss of £24.3mn in 2022 from a profit the previous year and recorded a provision of £99mn related to a VAT dispute with HMRC.
- The company's French entities were convicted of money laundering and VAT fraud, resulting in fines totaling €10mn.

The directors believe that Lycamobile UK will be able to continue operating and meeting its obligations as they fall due for the foreseeable future. They also stated that financial risks have been mitigated by the availability of support from related parties if required.
