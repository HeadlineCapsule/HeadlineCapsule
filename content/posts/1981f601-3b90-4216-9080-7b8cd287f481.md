# **美国和中国** 尽管贸易关系紧张，但两国仍同意在气候问题上合作

**美国和中国**，作为全球前两大温室气体排放国，已同意在气候行动方面加强合作，特别是在从煤炭向清洁能源过渡方面。在 **约翰·波德斯塔**（John Podesta）与中方代表 **刘振民** 举行会议后，双方达成了这一共识，此次会议被描述为“深入而富有成效”。美国国务院强调了进行“技术”交流和加强在可再生能源及淘汰煤炭使用方面的合作计划。这一积极的**气候外交**进展尤为显著，因为目前**两国之间存在贸易紧张关系**，这之前阻碍了相关进展。该协议是在联合国 COP28 气候峰会前双方发表的“阳光明媚之地声明”基础上的延续，在声明中，两国承诺将摆脱化石燃料。 

**美国和中国** 对气候合作的承诺意义重大，表明了两国愿意在关键的全球议题上合作，尽管地缘政治关系紧张。这一协议有望加速迈向更可持续未来的进程，并可能影响其他国家也采取类似行动。重点减少煤炭使用尤其重要，因为煤炭的碳排放量很高，向可再生能源转型是应对气候变化的关键一步。

# US and China agree on climate collaboration despite trade tensions 

**The United States and China**, the world's top two polluters, have agreed to enhance their collaboration on climate action, specifically on the transition from coal to clean energy sources. This development comes after a meeting between the new US climate envoy, **John Podesta**, and his Chinese counterpart, **Liu Zhenmin**, which was described as "in-depth and productive." The US State Department highlighted plans for "technical" exchanges and increased cooperation on renewable energy and coal phase-down. This positive step forward in **climate diplomacy** is particularly notable given the current **trade tensions** between the two countries, which had previously hindered progress. The agreement builds on the "Sunnylands statement" made ahead of the UN's COP28 climate summit, where both countries pledged to move away from fossil fuels.

The US and China's commitment to climate collaboration is significant as it demonstrates a willingness to cooperate on critical global issues despite geopolitical tensions. This agreement has the potential to accelerate progress toward a more sustainable future and could influence other nations to follow suit. The focus on coal reduction is especially important due to its high carbon emissions, and the transition to renewable energy sources is a crucial step in the fight against climate change.
