美国及其盟友称中国正在“积极招募”他们的战斗机飞行员

# 五眼联盟警告中国军队招募西方飞行员训练自身飞行员

美国、英国、加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰（五眼伙伴）联合警告称，中国人民解放军（PLA）正在“积极招募”西方战斗机飞行员来训练其自己的军事飞行员。根据国家网络安全中心（NCSC）主任迈克尔·凯西（Michael Casey）的说法，PLA在全球范围内使用具有隐蔽联系的私营公司，并为此提供高薪。

## 要点：
- 中国的PLA正在通过隐藏与解放军关系并提供高薪的私营公司招募西方战斗机飞行员来训练其飞行员。
- 五眼伙伴已发布警告公告，强调这一持续威胁，旨在阻止西方飞行员协助中国。
- 招募方法包括瞄准飞行工程师、空中作战中心工作人员以及军事战术专家。
- PLA寻求了解西方最先进的飞机和战术，为潜在的冲突（如台湾）做准备。
- 美国商务部已对参与跨国招募活动的团体实施制裁。
- 中国对这些措施的回应包括以不同名称和地点纳入实体。
- 英国更新了《国家安全法》，允许起诉分享军事信息的前飞行员。
- 北约举行会议，讨论PLA招募活动所带来的威胁。

## 建议：
五眼伙伴应继续通过制裁、立法更新和国际合作来监控和应对中国军队的招募活动。

 **Summary**

The US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (Five Eyes partners) have jointly warned that China's People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is "aggressively recruiting" western fighter pilots to train its own military aviators. The PLA uses private firms globally with concealed ties and offers exorbitant salaries for this purpose, as stated by Michael Casey, NCSC director.

**Key Points:**
- China's PLA is recruiting western fighter pilots to train its aviators through private firms that hide their connections with the Chinese military and offer high pay.
- The Five Eyes partners have issued a warning bulletin highlighting this persistent threat, aiming to deter western pilots from assisting China.
- Recruitment methods include targeting flight engineers, air operations center staff, and experts in military tactics.
- PLA seeks knowledge about state-of-the-art Western aircraft and tactics for potential conflicts like Taiwan.
- The US Department of Commerce has imposed sanctions on groups involved in recruitment efforts across various countries.
- China's response to these measures includes incorporating entities under different names and locations.
- The UK updated its National Security Act, allowing prosecution of former pilots for sharing military information.
- Nato held a conference to address the threat posed by PLA recruitment efforts.

**Recommendations:**
The Five Eyes partners should continue monitoring and countering China'amo recruitment activities through sanctions, legislation updates, and international cooperation.
