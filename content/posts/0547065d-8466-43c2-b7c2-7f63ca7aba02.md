# 当顾客并不总是正确时

**在日本，随着社会变化和人口压力挑战传统服务标准，“顾客至上”的概念正在发生重大转变**。

该国以优质的客户服务而闻名，“**神**”（kamisama）一词体现了日本人对客户的高度尊重。然而，**“顾客骚扰”现象**的增加促使人们重新审视这一观念。此术语指的是不可接受的行为，包括客户对服务人员的口头辱骂、威胁和人身暴力，为此计划修订劳动法来保护员工。

尽管与其他国家相比此类事件相对温和，但人们对事件数量上升的看法仍引起关注。随着**日本人口结构变化**，**各行业保持相同服务水平的难度越来越大**。该国的**通货紧缩**和**产品缩水**历史也导致企业不愿提高价格，影响了盈利能力和可持续性。

此外，日本极高的服务标准导致**资源配置不当**，过分关注劳动密集型服务。随着工作年龄人口缩减，这种不平衡变得更加明显，其他行业也面临招工难题。

一份全球研究论文强调了**顾客无礼行为与工作场所精神健康问题**之间的联系，并将此归因于“顾客至上”的心态。这种权力不平衡以及员工因此产生的屈从地位越来越被视为过时观念。因此，日本正处于转折点，认识到客户虽然拥有权利，但并不总是正确的。

# When the customer is not always right

**In Japan, the concept of "the customer is always right" is undergoing a significant shift as societal changes and demographic pressures challenge traditional service standards**. 

The country's reputation for exceptional customer service is well-known, with the term "kamisama" reflecting the high regard for customers. However, the **increasing phenomenon of "customer harassment"** has prompted a re-evaluation of this mindset. This term refers to a range of unacceptable behaviors, including verbal abuse, threats, and physical violence from customers towards service workers, which has led to a planned revision of labor laws to protect staff.

The perception of a rise in such incidents, despite their relatively tame nature compared to other countries, is causing concern. This is especially true as **Japan's demographics change**, making it **harder to maintain the same level of service across industries**. The country's history of **deflation** and **product shrinkflation** has also contributed to a reluctance to raise prices, impacting profitability and sustainability. 

/n/n

Additionally, the extremely high standards of service in Japan have resulted in a **misallocation of resources**, with a disproportionate focus on labor-intensive services. As the working-age population shrinks, this imbalance becomes more pronounced, and other industries struggle to attract workers.

A global research paper highlights the link between **customer incivility and mental health issues in the workplace**, attributing this to the "customer is always right" mindset. This imbalance of power and the resulting subservience of employees are increasingly seen as anachronistic. As a result, Japan is approaching a turning point, recognizing that while customers have rights, they are not always right.
