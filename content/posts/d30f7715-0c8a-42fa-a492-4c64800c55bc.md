在涉嫌操纵市场的案件中，特劳菲格拉支付了5500万美元的美国罚款。

**摘要：**

在最近的和解协议中，商品交易商 Trafigura 向美国监管机构支付了 5500 万美元的罚款，以解决 2018 年至 2020 年期间涉嫌欺诈和操纵的指控。商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）指控该公司**操纵燃料油基准价格**、拥有“非法获取”的内幕信息并妨碍举报人沟通。

CFTC 的执法行动表明其致力于维护衍生品市场的诚信，防止交易滥用。Trafigura 既没有承认也没有否认指控，但自指控发生以来已采取重大措施加强合规计划。罚款是针对该公司的多项调查的一部分，该公司在截至 3 月的六个月内实现利润 15 亿美元，主要在新加坡、日内瓦和休斯顿开展业务。

在另一与巴西“洗车”政治腐败丑闻相关的案件中，Trafigura 对美国的贿赂指控表示认罪，并同意支付 1.27 亿美元的罚款和没收利润。该公司还在瑞士面临审判，被指控贿赂安哥拉官员。

CFTC 对台湾领导人的最新诉讼包括指控 Trafigura 从墨西哥一家交易实体的员工那里非法获得了对汽油市场至关重要的非公开信息，并在 2017 年操纵了燃料油基准价格以谋取其期货和掉期头寸的利益。该公司还被指控要求员工签署妨碍与当局沟通潜在违规行为的非披露协议。这是 CFTC 首次指控公司干预举报人沟通。

Trafigura 已同意修改其就业合同中的保密条款，以确保它们不会抑制关于非法活动的与当局的沟通。

 **Summary:**  

In a recent settlement, commodities trading house Trafigura has paid a $55 million fine to US regulators over charges of fraud and manipulation between 201amo-to-2020. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused the company of **manipulating a fuel oil benchmark**, possessing 'improperly obtained' inside information, and impeding whistleblower communications.

The CFTC enforcement action demonstrates its commitment to maintaining integrity in derivatives markets by preventing trading abuses. Trafigura neither admitted nor denied the allegations but has taken significant steps to enhance its compliance program since the period of the charges. The fine is part of several investigations into the company, which made profits of $1.5 billion in the six months leading up to March and operates majorly out of Singapore, Geneva, and Houston.

In a separate case related to Brazil's Lava Jato political corruption saga, Trafigura pleaded guilty to US charges of bribery and agreed to pay $127 million in fines and forfeited profits. The company is also facing trial in Switzerland on charges of bribing officials in Angola.

The CFTC's latest case against the Taiwan leader includes allegations that Trafigura improperly obtained non-public information material to the gasoline market from an employee at a Mexican trading entity and manipulated fuel oil benchmark prices in 2017 for its futures and swaps positions. The company is also accused of requiring employees to sign non-disclosure agreements that impeded communications with authorities over potential violations, marking the first time the CFTC charged a company for interfering with whistleblower communications.

Trafigura has agreed to modify its employment contracts' NDA provisions to ensure they do not inhibit communication with authorities about illegal activity.
