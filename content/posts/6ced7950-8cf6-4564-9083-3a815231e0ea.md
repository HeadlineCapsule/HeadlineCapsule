亨特嘲讽说“投工党一票”，自民党紧追高级保守党人。

## 摘要：
在大选前的一次异常举动中，**财政大臣**杰里米·亨特开玩笑地说支持 **策略性投票**，他敦促选区选民在他的萨里席位上“投工党一票”。这一评论突显了自由民主党（自民党）在即将到来的选举中对保守党高层人士构成的威胁。自民党目标是获得20至30个席位，并瞄准南部保守党的据点和内阁成员，如亨特本人、奇切斯特的教育大臣吉利安·基冈和切尔滕纳姆的司法大臣亚历克斯·乔克。

“**大人物策略”**被认为是一种激励当地选民并为自民党筹集资金的方式。最近的补选胜利提高了他们的信心，他们希望复制1997年大选中保守党内阁大臣迈克尔·波蒂略出人意料的失败。

## 趣味问题：

 Q: **策略性投票**如何影响选举结果？
 A: 当选民支持除自己首选候选人以外的其他候选人以阻止另一名候选人获胜时，就会发生战术性投票。这种策略可能会显著改变结果，因为它可能导致某些政党和候选人的意外胜利或失败。在这种情况下，杰里米·亨特对战略性投票的支持可能会影响萨里的选民转而支持工党而不是保守党，从而增加自民党在该席位上获胜的可能性。

Q: 有哪些因素会影响传统强势保守党地区的政治格局?
A：历史上稳固的保守党席位的政治动态变化可归因于多种因素，例如人口结构变化、选民偏好的演变以及对当前政府政策或表现的不满。在这方面，自民党正通过利用保守派政府的所谓失败，将自己定位为心怀不满的托利党支持者的可行替代选择，从而瞄准这些选区。

Q: “**大人物策略”**如何影响自由民主党的筹款工作？

 A："大人物战略 "涉及针对保守党的高调人物，可能会对自民党筹款产生重大影响。通过关注这些知名政治家，该党可能吸引那些对其现任代表不满或希望支持另一种政治力量的个人的捐款。此外，该策略可能会引发媒体对目标候选人竞选活动的关注和公众兴趣，从而进一步提升自民党的筹款潜力。

## Summary:
In an unusual move ahead of the general election, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt joked about endorsing tactical voting by urging constituents to "Vote Labour" in his own Surrey seat. This comment highlights the threat posed by the Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems) to senior Conservative figures during the upcoming elections. The Lib Dems aim to gain 20-30 seats, targeting southern Tory strongholds and cabinet members such as Hunt himself, education secretary Gillian Keegan in Chichester, and justice secretary Alex Chalk in Cheltenham.

The "big beast strategy" is seen as a way to galvanize local voters and raise funds for the Lib Dems. Recent by-election wins have boosted their confidence, with hopes of replicating the unexpected loss experienced by Tory cabinet minister Michael Portillo in 1997's general election.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: How does tactical voting impact the outcome of an election?
A: Tactical voting occurs when a voter supports a candidate other than their first choice to prevent another candidate from winning. This strategy can significantly alter the results, as it may lead to unexpected victories or defeats for certain parties and candidates. In this case, Jeremy Hunt's endorsement of tactical voting could potentially influence his constituents in Surrey to vote Labour instead of Conservative, thereby increasing the chances of a Lib Dem victory in that seat.

Q: What factors contribute to the changing political landscape in traditionally strong Tory areas?
A: The shifting political dynamics in historically solid Tory seats can be attributed to various factors such as demographic changes, evolving voter preferences, and dissatisfaction with current government policies or performance. In this context, the Lib Dems are targeting these constituencies by capitalizing on perceived failures of the Conservative government and presenting themselves as a viable alternative for disenchanted Tory suppor
ters.

Q: How might the "big beast strategy" impact fundraising efforts for the Liberal Democrats?
A: The "big beast strategy," which involves targeting high-profile Conservative figures, can have a significant effect on fundraising efforts for the Lib Dems. By focusing on these prominent politicians, the party may attract donations from individuals who are dissatisfied with their current representatives or those seeking to support an alternative political force. Additionally, this strategy could generate media attention and public interest in the campaigns of targeted candidates, further boosting fundraising potential for the Lib Dems.
