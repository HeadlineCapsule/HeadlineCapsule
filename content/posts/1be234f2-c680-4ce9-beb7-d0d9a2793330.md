调查显示全球央行计划增加美元储备

# 全球央行美元储备调查报告

官方货币和金融机构论坛（OMFIF）最近的一项调查显示，尽管一些国家呼吁摆脱美元，但**全球央行**计划增加其美元储备。调查表明，由于美国利率上升，这些机构中有18%的净比例打算在未来一到两年内增加对美元的敞口。

与去年只有6%的净比例计划增加对美元的分配相比，这一趋势标志着一个显著的转变。在央行中，人民币的需求在以前的增长后停滞不前，这阻止了它作为一种替代储备货币被采用。

2022年，3000亿美元俄罗斯央行资产被冻结，促使一些新兴经济体呼吁减少对美元的依赖。然而，OMFIF的管理董事Nikhil Sanghani表示，由于亚洲央行对美元的需求强劲，以及亚洲和拉丁美洲国家人民币分配的下降，这一叙事目前停滞不前。

在短期（1-2年）内，美元需求是由美国利率预计将高于中国利率所驱动的。然而，从10年的角度来看，储备管理者仍然预计美元在全球储备中的份额将逐渐下降到55%的平均分配，而人民币的份额为2.3%。

调查还强调，在过去一年中，黄金在央行总储备中的比例从9%上升到11%，有15%的净比例计划在未来一到两年内增加对黄金敞口。如果这一趋势持续下去，央行可能会在那段时间内购买价值6000亿美元的黄金。

总之，尽管新兴经济体中存在去美元化和采用替代储备货币的一些势头，但短期因素，如美国利率上升，继续推动全球央行对美元的需求。

 # Report on Global Central Banks' Dollar Reserves Survey

A recent survey conducted by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) reveals that **global central banks** are planning to increase their dollar reserves, despite calls from some countries to move away from US currency. The survey indicates a net 18% of these institutions intend to boost their exposure to the US dollar over the next one to two years due to elevated interest rates in the United States.

This trend marks a significant shift compared to last year, where only a net n6% planned to increase their allocation to the greenback. The demand for the Chinese renminbi among central banks has stalled after previous growth, halting its inclusion as an alternative reserve currency.

The freezing of over $300bn worth of Russian central bank assets in 2022 sparked calls from some emerging economies to reduce reliance on the dollar. However, Nikhil Sanghani, managing director at OMFIF, suggests that this narrative has stalled for now due to strong demand for dollars among Asian central banks and a decline in renminbi allocations by those in Asia and Latin America.

In the short term (1-2 years), dollar demand is driven by expected higher returns from US interest rates forecasted to remain above China's levels. However, on a 10-year view, reserve managers still anticipate a gradual decline in the dollar's share of global reserves to an average allocation of 55% compared to 2.3% for the renminbi.

The survey also highlighted that gold has become more popular among central banks as its proportion of total reserves rose from 9% to 11% over the past year, with a net 15% planning to increase their exposure in the next one to two years. If this trend continues, central banks could purchase an additional $600bn worth of gold during that period.

In conclusion, while there is some momentum for de-dollarization and alternative reserve currencies among emerging economies, short-term factors such as higher US interest rates continue to drive demand for the dollar among global central banks.
