# 在教育领域，有些目标优于其他目标 

**世界各地的教育部都希望改善教学成果和绩效指标**。然而，在取得更好成绩与培养更多具备更高文学、数学水平以及综合素质的学生之间存在着微妙的平衡。尽管很难评估改进后的教学方法是否导致了成绩膨胀或标志着标准提高，但国际排名（如Pisa）提供了政府影响范围之外的一项公正的衡量标准。

当识字率和算术能力达到目标时，**教育政策**的成功是显而易见的；然而，在应对诸如美国刑事司法系统的高重犯率等复杂问题时，就会出现挑战。尽管人们普遍同意学校或监狱中理想的结果，但对于实现这些结果的方法仍存在分歧。设定目标可以推动卓越表现，但也可能带来一些意外后果，因为它优先考虑某些目标而不是其他目标。

**对此，英格兰的私立学校通过减少提供的国家认可资格数量来应对这一问题**，让学生有更多时间学习专业课程和进行更深入的学习。公立学校的教师们感到羡慕，他们看到了在确保基础教育的同时探索创新教学方法的机会。然而，一些人担心这种做法可能会削弱某些学科部门在学校和家长中的影响力和尊重度。目标的吸引力在于它们可以加强特定科目或行业的能力；但是如果不定期审查其有效性，它们也会失去作用并造成负面影响——Bedales School成功实施资格改革就证明了这一点。

**专注于数量有限的重要目标可能比同时追求多个目标更有效**，在推动教育和其他政策领域的卓越表现方面亦是如此

# In education, some targets are better than others 

**Education ministries worldwide aim to improve outcomes and performance indicators**. However, there is a fine line between achieving better grades and producing more **literate**, **numerate**, and well-rounded students who possess the skills needed for higher education or employment. While it's challenging to assess if improved teaching methods result in grade inflation or signify rising standards, international rankings like Pisa provide an impartial metric outside governmental influence. 

The success of **education policies** is evident when literacy and numeracy rates are met; however, challenges arise when addressing complex areas such as the US criminal justice system's high reoffending rate. Despite broad agreement on desired outcomes in schools or prisons, there remains disagreement on methods to reach those goals. Setting targets can drive excellence but may also cause unintended consequences by prioritizing some objectives over others. 

**Private schools in England have responded by reducing the number of nationally recognized qualifications offered**, allowing students more time for specialized courses and deeper learning. State school teachers are envious, seeing an opportunity to ensure essential education while exploring innovative teaching methods. However, some worry that this approach may diminish the influence and respect of certain subject departments within schools and among parents. The appeal of targets lies in their power to strengthen specific subjects or sectors; however, they can also proliferate past their usefulness if not regularly reviewed for effectiveness, as demonstrated by Bedales School's successful implementation of qualification reforms.

 **Focusing on a limited number** of critical goals may be more effective than pursuing numerous objectives simultaneously when it comes to driving excellence in education and other policy areas.
