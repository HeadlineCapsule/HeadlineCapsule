AI进校园：课堂讨论文章

# 人工智能课堂阅读列表

本文为教师顾问提供了一份阅读列表，以供课堂上关于**人工智能**的讨论。所选文章涵盖了人工智能的各个方面，包括其对水消耗、来自朝鲜黑客的人工智能网络安全威胁、环境成本以及取代呼叫中心的潜力等方面的影响。其他主题还包括 OpenAI 和 Meta 新的人工智能模型中的推理能力、生成式人工智能、在线虚假信息、人工智能药物进入临床试验的病理学研究、因人工智能而改变的高管 MBA 教学以及与偷窃和自助结账系统相关的法医心理学等。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 人工智能在网络安全方面的应用既是威胁又是机遇吗？
   答案：文章提到朝鲜黑客使用人工智能进行更复杂的诈骗，这突显了先进技术带来的潜在威胁。然而，人工智能也为增强检测系统和预测分析提供了机会，从而增强了网络安全措施，这使人工智能在网络安全方面成为一把双刃剑。

2. 人工智能发展有哪些环境成本？
   答案：文章提到人工智能对大型科技公司水消耗的影响是一个外部性因素。其他潜在的环境成本可能包括能源使用、硬件生产和处置的电子废物，以及制造人工智能系统组件所需的资源消耗。

3. 人工智能药物进入临床试验将如何影响病理学研究？
   答案：文章提到一种人工智能药物即将首次进入人类临床试验，这可能会革命性地改变病理学研究。这一发展可能导致更有效、更有针对性的治疗方法，并通过人工智能技术的数据分析和模式识别能力更好地理解精神障碍。

## Summary:
The article presents a reading list curated by teacher advisers for classroom discussions on **AI**. The selected articles cover various aspects of AI, including its impacts on water consumption, cybersecurity threats from North Korean hackers using AI, environmental costs, and the potential to replace call centres. Other topics include reasoning capabilities in new AI models by OpenAI and Meta, generative AI, online disinformation, psychopathology with an AI-designed drug entering clinical trials, executive MBA teaching rethink due to AI, and forensic psychology related to shoplifting and self-checkout systems.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How can the use of AI in cybersecurity be both a threat and an opportunity? 
A1: The article mentions that North Korean hackers are using AI for more sophisticated scams, which highlights the potential threats posed by advanced technology. However, AI also presents opportunities to enhance security measures through improved detection systems and predictive analytics, making it a double-edged sword in cybersecurity.

Q2: What are some of the environmental costs associated with AI development? 
A2: The article references an externality related to AI's impact on water consumption by Big Tech companies. Other potential environmental costs could include energy usage, electronic waste from hardware production and disposal, as well as resource depletion for manufacturing components used in AI systems.

Q3: How might the introduction of an AI-designed drug into clinical trials impact psychopathology research? 
A3: The article mentions that an AI-designed drug is entering human clinical trial for the first time, which could revolutionize psychopathology research. This development may lead to more efficient and targeted treatments, as well as a better understanding of mental health disorders through data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities provided by AI technology.
