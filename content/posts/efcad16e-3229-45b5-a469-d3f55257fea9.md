# 金融行为监管局主席对“点名批评”提议受到批评表示惊讶

**英国金融行为监管局**（FCA）主席**阿什利·奥尔德里奇**对来自英国**金融**和**法律行业**的强烈反弹表示惊讶，**财政大臣杰里米·亨特**也对此表示批评。金融行为监管局提议更频繁地“点名批评”被调查的公司。奥尔德里奇澄清，该提议尚无最终决定，旨在提高**透明度**并**威慑不当行为**。该提议在政府内部引发了辩论，**金融服务部长比姆·阿福拉米**为政府质疑金融行为监管局行动的权利进行了辩护，同时断言财政大臣的干预不会使该监管机构政治化。该提议是在金融行为监管局被赋予促进英国**经济增长**和**国际竞争力**的新次要目标后提出的。同时，金融行为监管局首席执行官**尼基尔·拉蒂**强调了当前框架的局限性，称投资欺诈并不被认为足够“特殊”，不能点名被调查的公司。金融行为监管局目前正在分析近期咨询的反馈意见，并将花费数月时间做出决定。阿福拉米敦促金融行为监管局专注于核心问题，并对海外投资者感知可能受到的影响表示关切。他还驳斥了人们对加密货币投机和欺诈成为主流的担忧，认为投资者有能力做出明智的判断。

# FCA surprised by criticism over ‘name and shame’ proposal, says chair

**Ashley Alder**, chair of the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)**, has expressed surprise at the intense backlash from the UK's **financial** and **legal sectors**, as well as **chancellor Jeremy Hunt**, over the FCA's proposal to more frequently "name and shame" companies under investigation. Alder clarified that no decision has been finalized, and the proposal aims to enhance **transparency** and **deter wrongdoing**. This proposal has sparked debate within the government, with **City minister Bim Afolami** defending the government's right to question the FCA's actions while also asserting that the intervention of the chancellor does not politicize the watchdog. The proposal follows a new secondary objective given to the FCA to facilitate the UK's **economic growth** and **international competitiveness**. Meanwhile, **FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi** highlighted the current framework's limitations, stating that investment fraud is not considered "exceptional" enough to warrant naming companies under investigation. The FCA is currently analyzing feedback from a recent consultation and will take months to make a decision. Afolami urged the FCA to focus on core issues and expressed concerns about the potential impact on overseas investors' perceptions. He also dismissed worries regarding the mainstreaming of crypto speculation and fraud, arguing that investors are capable of making informed judgments.
