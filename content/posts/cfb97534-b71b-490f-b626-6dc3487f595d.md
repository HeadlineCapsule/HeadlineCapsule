能源监管机构警告全球面临十年末“令人瞠目”的石油过剩

# 国际能源署：全球油气市场将面临供大于求的局面

**国际能源署（IEA）警告称，到本十年末，全球将面临超过800万桶/日（b/d）的石油供应过剩，这可能导致价格下跌并影响生产商的业务计划。** 这种“巨大的缓冲”归功于石油生产商持续投资，尤其是来自美国的投资，尽管预计需求将在2030年之前达到峰值。

## 关键要点：
- IEA预测，到2030年，由于产量增加和欧佩克+管理原油价格的努力受挫，将出现超过800万桶/日的过剩产能。
- 需求放缓、供应增加以及可再生能源和电动汽车的大规模推广预计将对石油公司产生重大影响。
- 2023年，全球在油田上的资本支出达到5380亿美元，中东国家石油公司和中国进行了重大投资。
- IEA的预测受到石油行业的批评，但仍然警告说，如果生产商停止对新油气项目的投资，可能会导致“能源混乱”。
- 由于自2016年以来的自愿产量削减，欧佩克+的市场份额总和下降，面临未来产量扩张的挑战。
- 本十年末石油需求峰值的三大主要驱动因素包括电动汽车减少的汽油使用、中东（例如沙特阿拉伯）能源来源的转变和中国较低的增长率。
- IEA谨慎表示，其预测可能因较小的变化而偏离轨道，例如GDP增长增加、油价下跌或电动汽车推广速度放缓。

 **Article Summary:** The International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that the world will face an unprecedented surplus of over 8 million barrels per day (b/d) in oil capacity by the end of this decade, which could lead to lower prices and impact producers' business plans. This "massive cushion" is attributed to continued investment by oil producers, particularly from the US, despite a forecasted peak in demand before 2030.

**Key Points:**
- The IEA predicts more than 8mn b/d of excess capacity by 2030 due to increased production and undermining efforts by Opec+ to manage crude prices.
- Slowing demand, rising supply, and the mass rollout of renewable energy and electric vehicles are expected to have substantial implications for oil companies.
- Global capital spending on oil fields rose to $538bn in 2023, with significant investments from Middle Eastern state oil companies and China.
- The IEA's forecast has been criticized by the oil industry but remains a warning of potential "energy chaos" if producers cease investing in new oil and gas projects.
- Opec+ faces challenges to expand future production, as its total market share drops due to voluntary output cuts since 2016.
- Three main drivers for peak oil demand by the end of the decade include reduced petrol use from electric vehicles, a shift in energy sources in the Middle East (e.g., Saudi Arabia), and lower growth rates in China.
- The IEA cautions that its forecast could be deraired by relatively minor changes such as increased GDP growth, decreased oil prices, or slower EV rollout.
