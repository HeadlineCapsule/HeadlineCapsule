# **唐纳德·图斯克**改组内阁应对俄罗斯间谍丑闻

波兰总理**唐纳德·图斯克**对内阁进行改组，任命了**托马什·谢莫尼亚克**担任新任**内政部长**，他同时还将保留**国内情报协调员**的角色。**谢莫尼亚克**因一直以来对莫斯科的批评立场而闻名。此次人事变动的背景是，人们对莫斯科支持的间谍活动和俄罗斯通过各种手段（包括间谍、虚假信息和网络攻击）干涉波兰事务的担忧日益增长。

**谢莫尼亚克**在**图斯克**上一届任期内曾担任**国防部长**，自2014年**克里米亚**被吞并以来，他反复强调了来自俄罗斯的威胁。**图斯克**表示了对**谢莫尼亚克**的“无限信任”，强调了面对外部威胁，解决波兰内部安全和国防战略的重要性。

此次内阁改组还包括替换了三位将参加**欧洲议会选举**的部长。其中，前**文化部长** **巴特沃米·辛基耶维茨**监督了波兰**国家媒体公司**的争议性改革，他将被艺术史学家**汉娜·沃勃勒夫斯卡**取代。

**图斯克**政府一直在努力拆除上一届由**法律与公正党（PiS）**主导的政府所建立的政治机器，该政党的统治持续到了2023年。然而，他的努力部分受到制约，因为宪法法院挤满了**法律与公正党任命的法官**，并且他还面临着**安杰伊·杜达**总统支持的反对力量。

# Donald Tusk reshuffles cabinet amid Russia spy scandals

Polish Prime Minister **Donald Tusk** has **reshuffled his cabinet**, appointing **Tomasz Siemoniak**, a known **critic of Moscow**, as the new **interior minister**, while also retaining his role as **coordinator of domestic intelligence services**. This move comes amid growing concerns over **Moscow-backed spying** and **Russian interference** in Poland through various means, including **spies, disinformation, and cyber-attacks**. 

Siemoniak, who served as **defense minister** under Tusk's previous term, has repeatedly emphasized the **Russian threat** since the **annexation of Crimea** in **2014**. Tusk expressed his "unlimited trust" in Siemoniak, underscoring the importance of addressing Poland's internal security and defense strategies in the face of external threats. 

The cabinet reshuffle also includes the replacement of three other ministers who are leaving to run in the **European Parliament elections**. Among them is **Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz**, the former **culture minister** who oversaw the controversial overhaul of Poland's **state media company**. He has been replaced by art historian **Hanna Wróblewska**. 

Tusk's government has been working to dismantle the apparatus put in place by the previous **Law and Justice (PiS)** party, which ruled until 2023. However, his efforts have been partially hampered by the constitutional court, which is packed with **PiS-appointed judges**, and by opposition backed by **President Andrzej Duda**.
