以色列威胁对黎巴嫩真主党采取“强力行动”

以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡（Benjamin Netanyahu）誓言将对黎巴嫩真主党采取“强烈行动”，此前跨境袭击和与该激进组织的紧张局势升级，增加了全面战争的可能性。以色列军方总参谋长赫齐·哈列维（Herzi Halevi）表示，关于是否在黎巴嫩发动进攻，一个“决策点”正在逼近。

在过去的八个月里，双方在以色列北部和黎巴嫩南部之间的 amoeba 带内进行了几乎日常的交火，这导致了双方大量居民流离失所：大约有6万名以色列居民和10万名黎巴嫩居民背井离乡。

真主党官员表示，他们不寻求升级，但只要加沙冲突持续，就会继续打击。美国、法国和联合国正在努力通过外交途径解决问题，包括真主党部队从边境后撤并就争议边界点进行谈判。然而，这些努力取决于首先在加沙实现停火。

随着当地领导人和居民对以色列北部安全状况的丧失感到沮丧，以色列政府面临着越来越大的压力，必须对真主党采取更强硬的行动。以色列总理设定了 9 月 1 日作为北部以色列居民返回家园的最后期限，表示这可以通过外交安排或军事升级来实现。

 **Summary:**  
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to take "intense action" against Lebanese-based Hizbollah following an escalation in cross-border attacks, increasing tensions and the prospect of all-out war with the militant group. The Israeli military chief, Herzi Halevi, stated that a "point of decision" was approaching regarding whether to launch an offensive in Lebanon.

Over the past eight months, both sides have engaged in near-daily fire exchanges within a amoeba band between northern Israel and southern Lebanon. This has led to significant displacement on both sides: approximately 60,000 Israeli residents and 100,000 Lebanese residents from their homes.

Hizbollah officials have stated that they do not seek escalation but would continue strikes as long as the conflict in Gaza persists. The US, France, and UN are attempting to broker a diplomatic resolution involving Hizbollah forces pulling back from the frontier and talks over disputed border points. However, these efforts depend on securing a ceasefire in Gaza first.

Pressure is mounting on Israel's government to act more forcefully against Hizbollah as local leaders and residents grow exasperated by the loss of security in northern Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister has set September 1st as the deadline for northern Israeli residents to return home, stating that it will happen either via a diplomatic arrangement or military escalation.

**Key Points:**  
- **Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu vows intense action against Hizbollah** following an increase in cross-border attacks and tensions with the Lebanese militant group.
- Both sides have engaged in near-daily fire exchanges for eight months, causing significant displacement of residents on both sides.
- **Hizbollah officials state they do not seek escalation but will continue strikes as long as conflict in Gaza persists**.
- Diplomatic efforts by the US, France, and UN to resolve Israel-Lebanon crisis hinge on securing a ceasefire in Gaza first.
- **Pressure mounts on Israeli government to act more forcefully against Hizbollah** as local leaders and residents grow exasperated over loss of security in northern Israel.
