牛市来袭，生物技术公司排队上市

**生物技术公司上市为美国上市市场带来利好**

Alumis 和 Upstream Bio 两家生物技术公司最近申请了首次公开募股（IPO），这是数十家生命科学公司今年准备上市的一部分。尽管 2021 年新上市的公司表现不佳，但这些生物技术初创公司仍信心满满地向美国证券交易委员会（SEC）进行了保密申请。

Alumis 在完成 2.59 亿美元的融资后宣布计划在纳斯达克上市，估值约为 10 亿美元。该公司的首领药物针对重度斑块性银屑病，而 Upstream Bio 正在开发治疗哮喘等炎症性疾病的药物。两家公司都预计将在 11 月总统大选之前上市，以避免市场波动。

美国生物技术 IPO 市场在经历去年衰退和利率上涨后的缓慢复苏后表现出改善迹象。今年迄今，生物技术公司通过美国 IPO 筹集了 17 亿美元，比 2021 年同期增长 64%。此外，之前上市的公司的募资活动反弹得更快，“后续”交易同比增长超过 100%，达到 165 亿美元。

尽管存在这种积极趋势，但大多数生物技术 IPO 的交易价格低于其初始发行价。然而，像 CG 肿瘤学和 Rapport 疗法这样的例外自上市以来取得了显着收益。生物技术分析师迈克·佩伦（Mike Perrone）认为，由于预计美联储会降低利率，投资者热情在第二季度冷却下来。

鉴于近期 IPO 的表现喜忧参半，一些公司可能会选择推迟上市，直到总统大选之后，届时利率情况更加明朗。Alumis 和 Upstream Bio 的领军药物正处于晚期试验阶段，这可能会吸引大型制药集团的战略兴趣，它们希望在上市之前补充自己的管线。

 **Biotech IPOs in Bullish Sign for US Listings Market**

Two biotech companies, Alumis and Upstream Bio, have recently filed for initial public offerings (IPOs) as part of a trend where dozens more life sciences firms are preparing to go public this year. Despite the poor performance of newly listed companies in 2021, these biotech start-ups remain undeterred and confidentially filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Alumis announced its plans to list on Nasdaq after completing a $259 million funding round at a valuation of around $1 billion. The company's lead drug targets severe plaque psoriasis, while Upstream Bio is developing medicines for inflammatory diseases such as asthma. Both companies are expected to list before the November presidential election in hopes of avoiding market volatility.

The US biotech IPO market has shown signs of improvement after a slow recovery from last year's downturn and interest rate hikes. Biotechs have raised $1.7 billion through US IPOs so far this year, up 64% compared to the same period in 2021. Additionally, fundraising by previously listed companies has rebounded faster, with "follow-on" deals rising more than 100% year on year to $16.5 billion.

Despite this positive trend, most biotech IPOs are trading below their initial offering price. However, some exceptions like CG Oncology and Rapport Therapeutics have seen significant gains since going public. Biotech analyst Mike Perrone suggests that investor enthusiasm has cooled in the second quarter due to expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Given the mixed performance of recent IPOs, some companies may choose to delay their listing until after the presidential election and when there is more clarity on interest rates. Alumis and Upstream Bio's lead drugs are in late-stage trials, which could attract strategic interest from large pharmaceutical groups looking to replenish their pipelines before going public.
