特斯拉投资者应拒绝埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）560亿美元的薪酬，代理顾问ISS称

# 摘要：
特斯拉（Tesla）的代理顾问 ISS 建议股东拒绝埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）560亿美元的薪酬，同时支持特斯拉在德克萨斯州重新注册的提案。由于其前所未有的规模，该薪酬被 ISS 和 Glass Lewis 视为“超大”。然而，关于搬迁到德克萨斯州的建议更加谨慎，因为它承认潜在风险，但得出结论认为股东权利不会受到重大损害。

# 有趣的问题：

1. 问题：ISS 对于埃隆·马斯克 560 亿美元薪酬的主要担忧是什么？
   答案：主要担忧是该奖项的价值从一开始就被视为超大，尽管承认了特斯拉的增长和盈利能力。ISS 和 Glass Lewis 都认为这对首席执行官的薪酬包来说规模过大。

2. 问题：ISS 如何谨慎支持特斯拉在德克萨斯州重新注册的提案？
   答案：虽然承认董事会采取的过程还有待改进，并认识到德克萨斯商业法院是新的，没有丰富的法律案例先例，但 ISS 得出结论认为，股东权利似乎不会受到重大损害。这种谨慎的支持表明相信潜在的好处不会对公司或其投资者造成重大风险。

3. 问题：如果特斯拉未能赢得薪酬投票和重新注册决议会产生什么影响？
   答案：如果特斯拉输掉这两个提案，可能会损害董事会的信誉，引发人们对埃隆·马斯克在特斯拉未来的疑问，并可能影响他在其他地方开发人工智能产品的计划。此外，如果在重新注册决议中失败，特斯拉将继续在特拉华州注册，这可能与马斯克对公司过渡到人工智能和机器人公司的愿景不一致，他希望对公司有更大的控制权。

**Summary:**
Tesla's proxy adviser ISS has advised shareholders to reject Elon Musk'cu $56bn pay award, while supporting a proposal for Tesla to reincorporate in Texas. The pay award was deemed "outsized" by both ISS and Glass Lewis due to its unprecedented size. However, the recommendation on moving to Texas is more cautious as it acknowledges potential risks but concludes that shareholders' rights would not be materially harmed.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: What are the main concerns raised by proxy adviser ISS regarding Elon Musk’s $56bn pay award? 
   A: The primary concern is that the value of the award was considered outsized from its inception, despite recognizing Tesla's growth and profitability. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have deemed it an excessive size for a CEO compensation package.
   
2. Q: How does ISS justify their cautious support of the proposal to reincorporate Tesla in Texas? 
   A: While acknowledging that the process undertaken by the board leaves something to be desired, and recognizing that Texas business courts are new with no robust body of legal case law precedents, ISS concludes it is not readily apparent that shareholders' rights would be materially harmed. This cautious support suggests a belief in potential benefits without significant risks for the company or its investors.
   
3. Q: What are the implications if Tesla fails to win the pay vote and reincorporation resolutions? 
   A: If Tesla loseboth proposals, it could damage the credibility of the board, raise questions about Elon Musk's future at Tesla, and potentially impact his plans for developing artificial intelligence products elsewhere. Additionally, a loss on the reincorporation resolution would mean that Tesla remains incorporated in Delaware, which may not align with Musk's vision of greater control over the company as it transitions into an AI and robotics company.

**Summary:**
Tesla investors are advised by proxy adviser ISS to reject Elon Musk’s $56bn pay award, while supporting a proposal for Tesla to reincorporate in Texas. The pay award is considered excessive despite the growth and profitability of the company. Reincorporation in Texas has cautious support due to potential risks but no material harm to shareholders' rights.

**Interesting Questions:**
