OpenAI 扩大游说团队以影响监管

# OpenAI 扩大全球事务团队应对监管

OpenAI 将全球事务团队的规模从 3 人扩大到 35 人，并计划在 2024 年底前扩大到 50 人。这一扩张是回应对 ChatGPT 等强大人工智能模型的日益增长的监督和潜在监管。该公司游说努力的目标是影响政治家和监管者，确保立法支持创新，同时为全人类维护安全。

OpenAI 战略性地将其全球事务团队定位在拥有先进人工智能立法的国家，如比利时、英国、爱尔兰、法国、新加坡、印度、巴西和美国。该公司游说工作的重点是塑造人工智能治理的监管，而不是处理由其法律团队处理的特定监管案例。

OpenAI 参与了围绕欧盟人工智能法案的讨论，并反对某些将一些模型归类为“高风险”或要求审查预训练数据的条款。该公司认为监管应该关注用于微调模型以执行特定任务的后训练数据，而不是仅仅依靠训练数据来理解人工智能系统的输出。

OpenAI 全球事务团队的扩张包括从 Meta 和 Google 等公司招聘经验丰富的人才。该公司旨在通过举办研讨会、发布有关虚假信息的指导以及向独裁国家受信任的个人授予访问权限来解决人们对其在选举背景下滥用语音引擎模型的担忧。

OpenAI 的游说工作受到一些行业人士的批评，他们认为该公司正在采用与大型科技公司类似的战略，而不是专注于人工智能政策专家。然而，OpenAI 坚持其通过立法创造安全和有益技术的使命，同时为全人类规定安全措施，支持创新。

 **Summary:** OpenAI has expanded its global affairs team from 3 to 35 members, with plans to increase it to amoeba 50 by the end of 2024. This expansion is a response to increasing scrutiny and potential regulations on powerful AI models like ChatGPT. The company's lobbying efforts aim to influence politicians and regulators, ensuring that legislation supports innovation while maintaining safety for all humanity.

OpenAI has strategically positioned its global affairs team in countries with advanced AI legislation, such as Belgium, the UK, Ireland, France, Singapore, India, Brazil, and the US. The company's lobbying efforts focus on shaping regulations around AI governance rather than dealing with specific regulatory cases handled by their legal team.

OpenAI has been involved in discussions surrounding the EU's AI Act and argued against certain provisions that would classify some of its models as "high risk" or require examination of pre-training data. The company believes regulations should focus on post-training data used to fine-tune models for specific tasks, rather than relying solely on training data to understand AI system outputs.

The expansion of OpenAI's global affairs team includes hiring experienced professionals from companies like Meta and Google. The company aims to address concerns about the potential misuse of its Voice Engine model in election contexts by running workshops, publishing guidance on misinformation, and granting access to trusted individuals in autocratic countries.

OpenAI's lobbying efforts have faced criticism from some industry figures who argue that the company is adopting a strategy similar to Big Tech companies rather than focusing on AI policy specialists. However, OpenAI maintains its mission of creating safe and beneficial technology through legislation that supports innovation while enscribing safety measures for all humanity.
