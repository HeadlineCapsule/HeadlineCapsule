Shein在可能在伦敦上市之前提交了机密文件

**要点：**
- 在线时尚集团 Shein 向英国金融行为监管局 (FCA) 提交了保密文件，申请首次公开募股 (IPO)，旨在伦敦上市。
- 该公司市值可能达到 500 亿英镑，并正在与高盛、摩根大通和摩根士丹利合作进行 IPO 计划。
- Shein 面临其供应链中存在强迫劳动的指控，但否认这些说法，称对这种做法有零容忍政策。
- 该公司决定在伦敦上市，这是因为美国和中国之间的紧张局势影响了其最初在纽约上市的计划。
- Shein 仍在等待北京当局的批准，如果出现监管障碍，潜在的替代选择包括香港或其他地点。
- 英国政客们对 Shein 上市表示了兴趣，因为这为对该公司实施更高的监管标准和解决强迫劳动指控的担忧提供了机会。

 **Key Points:**
- Online fashion group Shein has filed confidential paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO) with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, aiming for a London listing.
- The company could achieve a market valuation of about £50bn and is working with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley on its IPO plans.
- Shein has faced allegations of forced labor in its supply chain but denies these claims, stating it has a zero-tolerance policy for such practices.
- The company's decision to pursue a London listing comes after tensions between the US and China impacted its initial plan for an IPO in New York.
- Shein is still awaiting approval from Beijing authorities, with potential alternative options including Hong Kong or another location if regulatory hurdles arise.
- UK politicians have expressed interest in a Shein listing due to the opportunity it presents for imposing higher regulatory standards on the company and addressing concerns over forced labor allegations.
