民主党人排队为拜登辩护，民调显示人们对他的健康状况越来越担忧

**新闻摘要**

最近，民主党的著名人物站出来为乔·拜登辩护，因为人们越来越担心他在灾难性的辩论表现之后是否适合担任总统。CBS新闻-尤戈夫民意调查显示，72%的注册选民认为总统不应该因为对他的年龄和认知健康的担忧而寻求连任，近四分之三的人在辩论后对拜登担任总统的能力表示怀疑。

这场辩论导致许多民主党立法者、捐赠者和党派活动人士质疑他是否应该仍然是他们的提名人。作为回应，拜登开始了筹款之旅，试图向富有的支持者保证他有能力击败特朗普并再次担任总统四年。

尽管捐赠者和党派成员提出了担忧，但有些人仍然致力于支持拜登，认为他是击败特朗普的最佳候选人。拜登竞选活动驳斥了有害的民意调查数据，称他们自周四的辩论以来已经筹集了3300万美元，包括2600万美元来自基层捐赠者。

高调的支持者，如民主党众议院少数党领袖哈基姆·杰弗里斯和美国众议院前议长南希·佩洛西在周日围绕拜登团结起来，将他的糟糕表现描述为总统的一个坏夜晚。《纽约时报》报道称，拜登的家庭成员在戴维营的一次聚会期间敦促他留在比赛中。

 **Article Summary**

In a recent development, prominent Democrats have come forward to defend Joe Biden amidst rising concerns over his fitness for office following a disastrous debate performance. A CBS News-YouGov poll revealed that 72% of registered voters believe the president should not seek reelection due to worries about his age and cognitive health, with nearly three-quarters expressing doubts about Biden's ability to serve as president after the debate.

Despebate performance has led many Democratic lawmakers, donors, and party operatives to question whether he should remain their nominee. In response, Biden embarked on a whistle-stop tour of fundraisers in an attempt to reassure wealthy backers about his ability to defeat Trump and serve another four years as president.

Despite the concerns raised by donors and party members, some remain committed to supporting Biden, believing that he is still the best candidate capable of beating Trump. The Biden campaign has dismissed damaging polling data, stating that they have raised $33 million since Thursday's debate, including $26 million from grassroots donors.

High-profile supporters like Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and former US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rallied around Biden on Sunday, framing his poor performance as just one bad night for the president. The New York Times reported that Biden's family members have urged him to stay in the race during a gathering at Camp David.
