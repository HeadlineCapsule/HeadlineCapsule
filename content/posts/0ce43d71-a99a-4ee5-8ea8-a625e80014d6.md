# 凯特·福尔布斯被任命为苏格兰副首席部长 

苏格兰新任首席部长**约翰·斯温尼**任命**凯特·福尔布斯**为**副首席部长**和**经济部长**。福尔布斯是苏格兰政界的一位杰出人物，曾竞争苏格兰民族党（SNP）的领袖职位，但在一场接近的竞选中输给了**哈米扎·尤萨夫**。在尤萨夫最近辞职后，斯温尼接任这一职务，并任命福尔布斯为副手，认可她的才华和潜力。 

福尔布斯是一位**虔诚的基督徒**，持有**社会保守观点**，这在党内自由派中引发了辩论。尽管如此，斯温尼还是赞扬了她的能力，并表示对她充满信心。作为副首席部长，福尔布斯将与斯温尼密切合作，推动经济增长、投资公共服务和解决儿童贫困问题。任命福尔布斯是斯温尼团结党内各方，提出具有较广泛选民吸引力的**温和的中左翼政策平台**努力的一部分。 

这个由经验丰富和新晋人才组成的内阁将于周四面临议会投票。随着福尔布斯接管经济部门，**马丽·麦艾伦**将继续监督**净零排放**和能源倡议。**洛娜·斯莱特**，苏格兰绿党的联合领袖，强调了坚持包括**性别承认改革**和**转化疗法禁令**在内的进步政策和承诺的重要性。对于支持少数派苏格兰民族党政府的苏格兰绿党来说，确保气候政策的落实也至关重要。

# Kate Forbes Appointed Deputy First Minister of Scotland 

**John Swinney**, Scotland's **new first minister**, has appointed **Kate Forbes** as **Deputy First Minister** and **Economy Secretary**.

Following Yousaf's recent resignation, Swinney has stepped up to fill the role and has brought Forbes onboard as his deputy, recognizing her talent and potential.

Forbes, a **committed Christian**, holds **socially conservative views**, which have sparked debate among liberals within the party. Nonetheless, Swinney has praised her abilities and expressed confidence in her abilities. As Deputy First Minister, Forbes will work closely with Swinney to drive economic growth, invest in public services, and address child poverty. The appointment of Forbes is part of Swinney's effort to unite the party and present a **moderate center-left policy platform** that appeals to a broader electorate.

The new cabinet, which includes a mix of experienced and fresh talent, will face a parliamentary vote on Thursday. With Forbes taking on the economy portfolio, **Màiri McAllan** will continue to oversee **net zero** and energy initiatives. **Lorna Slater**, co-leader of the **Scottish Greens**, has highlighted the importance of maintaining progressive policies and commitments, including **gender recognition reform** and a **ban on conversion therapy**. The Greens, who hold a crucial role in supporting the minority SNP government, will also be vigilant in ensuring the delivery of climate policies.
