美联储的首选通胀指标降至2.6%

**新闻摘要：**
美联储的首选通胀指标，个人消费支出（PCE）指数，5 月略有下降至 2.6%。这使中央银行保持在今年至少降息一次的轨道上。不包括食品和燃料价格的“核心”PCE 也从 4 月的 2.8% 下降了 0.2 个百分点。

市场正在押注美国中央银行将在 2024 年年底前降息。经济学家预计今年将大致进行两次降息，第一次在 9 月的概率超过 50%。然而，一些专家认为，由于通货膨胀放缓的步伐逐渐缓慢，9 月提前采取行动的可能性较小。

美联储的标杆 PCE 指数年度目标为 2%。月对月标杆利率保持不变，核心价格仅上涨了 0.1 个百分点，这与中央银行的年度目标一致。

尽管最近通货膨胀压力有所缓解，但今年年初令人失望的数据导致推迟了降息周期的开始。劳动力市场正成为美联储越来越重要的因素，因为它试图在降低通货膨胀的同时避免该领域的压力。

美国股市在早间交易中短暂触及纪录高位，但收盘下跌，S&P 受到潜在降息消息的影响，债券收益率全天波动。

 **Article Summary:**
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, decreased slightly to 2.6% in May. This keeps the central bank on track for at least one interest rate cut this year. The "core" PCE, which excludes food and fuel prices, also dropped by 0.2 percentage points from April's reading of 2.8%.

Markets are betting on a potential interest rate cut from the US central bank by the end of 2024. Economists expect roughly two quarter-point cuts this year, with more than a 50% chance for the first one in September. However, some experts believe that an earlier move in September is less likely due to the gradual pace at which inflation is easing.

The Federal Reserve's target for headline PCE index is 2% annually. The month-on-month headline rate was flat while core prices increased by just one-tenth of a percentage point, both in line with the central bank's annual goal.

Despite inflationary pressures easing recently, disappointing data at the start of the year has led to delays in starting a rate-cutting cycle. The labor market is becoming an increasingly important factor for the Federal Reserve as it tries to balance bringing down inflation without causing stress in this area.

US stocks briefly hit record highs during morning trading but closed lower, with the S&P amoled by the news of potential rate cuts and bond yields fluctuating throughout the day.
