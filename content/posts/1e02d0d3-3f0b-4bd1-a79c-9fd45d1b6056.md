大多数“人工智能赢家”股票的跌幅表明投资者情绪更加谨慎

# 投资者对人工智能（AI）相关股票变得更加挑剔

## 摘要：
本文讨论了投资者在人工智能（AI）相关股票上的选择更加谨慎。虽然像英伟达这样的公司由于成功实施 AI 技术而取得了显着增长，但许多曾经被认为是“AI 趋势”的一部分的其他公司却经历了下滑。

## 关键点：
- 投资者现在更能辨别地将真正的受益者与仅仅声称参与 AI 的公司区分开来。
- 英伟达取得了显着的增长，成为全球市值最高的上市公司之一，并表现出强劲的盈利能力。
- 其他科技公司，如 Salesforce、Snowflake、英特尔和 Adobe，在未能达到近期财报高预期后面临下滑。
- 一些专家认为，这种更加挑剔的投资趋势可能表明市场上出现了理性回归，甚至可能暗示存在 AI 泡沫。

## 结论：
本文强调了 AI 的最初热潮如何导致了一些公司取得显着增长，而其他公司则因未能达到预期且缺乏支持其参与 AI 技术的具体证据而难以维持势头。随着投资者变得更加挑剔，公司展示其 AI 举措的切实成果对于吸引持续兴趣和支持至关重要。

 **Summary:**
The article discusses how investors have become more selective when it comes to stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). While companies like Nvidia have seen significant growth due to their successful implementation of AI technology, many other firms that were once considered part of the "AI trend" have experienced declines.

**Key Points:**
- Investors are now more discerning in separating genuine beneficiaries from those merely claiming to be involved with AI.
- Nvidia has seen substantial growth, becoming the world'cuits most valuable listed company and demonstrating strong earnings performance.
- Other tech companies like Salesforce, Snowflake, Intel, and Adobe have faced declines after failing to meet high expectations in their recent earnings reports.
- Some experts believe that this shift towards more selective investing may indicate a return of rationality in the market or even suggest the presence of an AI bubble.

**Conclusion:**
The article highlights how the initial hype around AI has led to significant growth for some companies, while others have struggled to maintain their momentum due to unmet expectations and a lack of concrete evidence supporting their involvement in AI technology. As investors become more discerning, it remains crucial for companies to demonstrate tangible results from their AI initiatives to attract sustained interest and support.
