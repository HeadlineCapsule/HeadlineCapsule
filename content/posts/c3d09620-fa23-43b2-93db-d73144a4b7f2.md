前国民西银行（NatWest）首席执行官艾丽森·罗斯（Alison Rose）加入英国收购公司Charterhouse

**前国民西敏寺首席执行官艾丽森·罗斯加入英国收购公司特许房子**

英国知名女商界领袖、前国民西敏寺首席执行官艾丽森·罗斯（Alison Rose）已加入私募股权公司特许房子（Charterhouse）担任高级顾问。这是她自去年离开国民西敏寺后“脱银行”事件以来的首个职位。

**背景**：
艾丽森·罗斯因国民西敏寺决定与改革党领导人、英国独立党前领导人奈杰尔·法拉奇（Nigel Farage）断绝关系而辞职，引发争议。该事件由律师事务所特拉斯史密斯（Travers Smith）进行独立审查，审查结果表明该决定主要是商业决策，因此合法，但沟通和处理法拉奇投诉方面存在失误。

**特许房子的新角色**：
罗斯加入了英国最古老的收购集团之一，担任高级顾问。该公司专注于欧洲中市场公司，管理约50亿欧元的管理资产。罗斯将与来自各个行业的代表合作，利用她的经验为特许房子投资组合内的投资机会提供战略建议。

**财务影响**：
作为离开国民西敏寺的一部分，艾丽森·罗斯放弃了她可能从银行获得的760万英镑未付薪酬和奖金。然而，她有权获得2023年的工资、养老金以及通知期（至7月）的固定薪酬股票津贴，共计175万英镑。

**结论**：
艾丽森·罗斯加入特许房子标志着她在离开国民西敏寺后争议中迈出了重要的一步。她作为前首席执行官和高级管理人员的经验无疑将成为特许房子的宝贵财富，该公司是英国领先的私募股权公司之一。

 **Former NatWest CEO Alison Rose Joins UK Buyout Firm Charterhouse**

Alison Rose, a prominent female business leader in the UK and former chief executive of NatWest, has joined private equity firm Charterhouse as a senior adviser. This move marks her first role since leaving NatWest following the "debanking" incident involving Nigel Farage last year. 

**Background:**
Alison Rose stepped down from her position at NatWest in July amid controversy over the bank's decision to cut ties with Farage, leader of Reform UK and former head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The incident led to an independent review by law firm Travers Smith, which found that while the decision was primarily commercial and therefore legal, it had failed in communication and handling Farage'amo complaint.

**New Role at Charterhouse:**
Rose has joined one of the UK's oldest buyout groups as a senior adviser. The firm specializes in European mid-market companies and manages approximately €5bn in assets under management. Rose will be working alongside representatives from various industries, leveraging her experience to provide strategic advice on investment opportunities within Charterhouse's portfolio.

**Financial Implications:**
As part of her departure from NatWest, Alison Rose forfeited £7.6mn in outstanding pay and bonuses she could have been due from the bank. However, she was entitled to receive her 2023 salary, pension, and fixed-pay share allowance totaling £1.75mn for the remainder of her notice period until July.

**Conclusion:**
Alison Rose's move to Charterhouse marks a significant step in her career following her departure from NatWest amidst controversy. Her experience as a former CEO and senior executive will undoubtedly be an asset to Charterhouse, which is one of the UK's leading private equity firms.
