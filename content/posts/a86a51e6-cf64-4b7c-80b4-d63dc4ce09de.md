MSCI拒绝将其纳入主权债务指数，欧盟债券下跌

# 欧盟债券在MSCI拒绝将其纳入主权债务指数后下跌

在欧洲指数公司（MSCI）宣布不将其纳入其主权债券指数之后，欧盟（EU）债券走弱。这一决定阻碍了布鲁塞尔将自己建立为主流政府债券发行人的努力，并可能导致欧盟的借贷成本比各个成员国更高。

## 要点：
- MSCI 的决定是在其关于将欧盟债券纳入主权债务指数方面的咨询过程中出现“意见分歧”之后做出的。
- 在宣布后，基准 10 年期欧盟债券的收益率上涨了 0.06 个百分点，表明债券价格走弱。
- 自从其 7500 亿欧元的下一代欧盟计划于 2021 年开始以来，欧盟一直在推动重新分类为“主权”发行人，以减少借贷成本并增加投资者兴趣。
- MSCI 在欧盟议会选举中右翼政党取得重大进展之后做出了决定，这可能会影响未来对共同债务销售的支持。
- 尽管欧盟和德国都获得了三家领先机构中的两家给予的三级信用评级，但欧盟 10 年期债券的收益率高于德国。
- 预计其他指数提供商，如 ICE 和富时罗素（FTSE Russell），将在 8 月宣布他们的决定，如果他们将欧盟重新分类为主权发行人，可能会带来大量的资金流入。
- 欧盟的总债务已增长到约 5000 亿欧元，使其成为欧元区第六大债务国。
- MSCI 计划在 2025 年重新审查其关于欧盟债券纳入指数的决定，让一些分析师对未来的指数纳入保持乐观。

 **Summary:**  
EU Bonds Fall After MSCI Declines Inclusion in Sovereign Debt Indices

The European Union's (EU) bonds weakened after the index provider MSCI announced that it would not include them in its sovereign bond indices. This decision hinders Brussels’ efforts to establish itself as a mainstream government bond issuer and could potentially increase borrowing costs for the EU compared to individual member states.

**Key Points:**  
- MSCI's decision follows a "bifurcation of opinion" in its consultation process on including EU bonds in sovereign debt indices.
- The yield on benchmark 10-year EU bonds rose by 0.06 percentage points after the announcement, indicating weakened bond prices.
- The EU has been pushing for reclassification as a "sovereign" issuer since its €750bn NextGenerationEU program began in 2021 to reduce borrowing costs and increase investor interest.
- MSCI's decision came after far-right parties made significant gains in the EU parliamentary elections, potentially affecting future common debt sales support.
- The yield on the EU’s 10-year bond is higher than Germany's despite both having a triple-A credit rating from two of three leading agencies.
- Other index providers like ICE and FTSE Russell are expected to announce their decisions in August, with potential significant flows if they reclassify the EU as a sovereign issuer.
- The EU's total debt pile has grown to about €500bn, making it the sixth-largest in the Eurozone.
- MSCI plans to revisit its decision on EU bonds inclusion in 2025, leaving some analysts hopeful for future index inclusion.
