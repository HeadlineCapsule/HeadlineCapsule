# **北爱尔兰** 应**降低企业税** 以促进经济增长

**北爱尔兰**最大的商业游说团体 **小企业联合会（FSB）** 提议将该地区的企业税降至与 **爱尔兰共和国** 同等的较低水平。**小企业联合会**认为，目前英国 25% 的企业税税率阻碍了外国投资者对北爱尔兰的投资，而爱尔兰针对**小企业的12.5%税率和针对大公司的15%税率**推动了预算盈余。**小企业联合会**表示，北爱尔兰通过与爱尔兰共和国的税率保持一致，可以吸引更多的全球制造业投资，增加税收并创造就业机会。这一提议出现在北爱尔兰财政困难之际，当地官员警告公共服务和生产力低下。英国政府承诺将努力下放对北爱尔兰的企业税征收权力，但降低税率在英国可能会面临挑战。然而，**小企业联合会**相信，较低的税率可以改变北爱尔兰的经济局面，并已将其计划提交给财政部及英国官员。

# N Ireland should cut corporate tax to boost growth, says business lobby

**Northern Ireland's** biggest business lobby group, the **Federation of Small Businesses (FSB)**, has proposed a **cut in corporation tax** for the region to match the lower rate in the **Republic of Ireland**. The FSB argues that the current **25% corporation tax rate** in the UK is deterring investment in Northern Ireland, while Ireland's rate of **12.5% for small firms and 15% for large companies** is driving a budget surplus. By aligning with the Republic's rate, Northern Ireland could attract more global manufacturing investment, boost tax receipts, and create jobs, according to the FSB. This proposal comes as Northern Ireland struggles financially, with ministers warning of crumbling public services and low productivity. The UK government has promised to work on the devolution of corporation tax rates to Northern Ireland, but there are concerns that slashing taxes in the region could be a challenging sell in Britain. Nonetheless, the FSB believes that a lower tax rate could be a game-changer for Northern Ireland's economy and has presented its plan to the finance ministry and UK officials.
