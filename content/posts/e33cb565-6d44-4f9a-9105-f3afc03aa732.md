苹果供应商TDK声称在固态电池方面取得突破

# 苹果供应商TDK在固态电池技术上取得突破性进展

**新闻摘要：**

知名苹果供应商TDK宣布在固态电池技术上取得突破性进展，其研发的新材料能量密度是当前电池的100倍。这一创新有望显著影响无线耳机和智能手表等小型设备，使其能够延长使用时间并缩小设备尺寸。

**要点：**

- TDK研发的固态电池新材料能量密度为每升1000瓦时（Wh/l），远超当前技术水平。
- 新电池设计采用全陶瓷材料和氧化物固态电解质，以及锂合金阳极，提高了稳定性和安全性。
- TDK首席执行官齐藤信博认为这一突破将推动社会能源转型，并计划尽早商业化该技术。
- 固态电池被认为比传统液态电解质电池更安全、更轻、成本可能更低，并且具有更长的使用寿命和更快的充电速度。
- 新电池技术适用于小型电池，可替代手表和其他小型电子设备中的现有硬币形电池。
- 由于机械性能不佳和大规模生产困难，固态氧化物电池在电动汽车等大型应用领域仍面临挑战。
- 日本丰田、日产和本田等公司也在致力于商业化固态电池技术，重点是硫化物电解质，用于长续航电动汽车。

**担忧：**

CATL的罗宾·曾等行业专家表示，对于固态电池在大型应用（如电动汽车）中的实现和耐久性存在疑虑。

 **Article Summary:**  
TDK, a prominent Apple supplier, has announced a breakthrough in solid-state battery technology with the development of a new material offering an energy density 100 times greater than their current batteries. The innovation could significantly impact smaller gadgets such as wireless headphones and smartwatches by enabling longer operating times and smaller device sizes.

**Key Points:**  
- TDK's newly developed material for solid-state batteries has an energy density of 1,000 watt-hours per litre (Wh/l), a substantial improvement over the current technology.
- The new battery design utilizes all-ceramic materials and oxide-based solid electrolyte with lithium alloy anodes for increased stability and safety.
- TDK's chief executive, Noboru Saito, believes this breakthrough will contribute to society's energy transformation and plans for early commercialization of the technology.
- Solid-state batteries are considered safer, lighter, potentially cheaper, and offer longer performance and faster charging compared to traditional liquid electrolyte batteries.
- The new battery technology is designed for smaller-sized cells, replacing existing coin-shaped batteries in watches and other small electronics.
- Challenges remain in scaling up solid-state oxide-based batteries for larger applications like electric vehicles due to unfavorable mechanical properties and mass production difficulties.
- Japanese companies such as Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are also working on commercializing solid-state battery technology with a focus on sulphide-based electrolytes for long-range electric vehicles.

**Concerns:**  
Despebitism from industry experts like Robin Zeng of CATL suggests that there may be skepticism about the realization and durability of solid-state batteries, particularly in larger applications such as electric vehicles.
