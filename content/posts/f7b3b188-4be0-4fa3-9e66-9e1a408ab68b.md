# GameStop 和 AMC 股票在“迷因股”复苏中连续第二日大涨

**电子游戏零售商** **GameStop** 和 **电影院集团** **AMC Entertainment** 的股票在周二连续第二日飙升，这是由于对 **"迷因股"** 的交易兴趣复燃。这次股价飙升的导火索是 **零售投资者** **Keith Gill**（又名 **"Roaring Kitty"**）的重新出现，他在 **2020-2021 年迷因股热潮**中是一个关键人物。

GameStop 和 AMC 的**交易量**大幅增加，周一的交易量达到其20日平均值的15和20倍。这导致这两只股票都实现了可观的涨幅：GameStop 上涨 63%，AMC 飙升 78%，延续了前一交易日分别上涨 73% 和 77% 的势头。

**“迷因股”** 现象是指 **零售投资者** 在 **Reddit 的 wallstreetbets** 之类的社交媒体平台上协调投资经营不善公司的股票，这些公司通常被 **对冲基金** 大量**做空**。这种策略是由一群在疫情期间（尤其是那些收到政府刺激支票的人）的零售投资者采用的，导致像 **Melvin Capital** 这样的对冲基金遭受重大损失，因为它们在 GameStop 等股票上持有空头头寸。

虽然本周拉升行情中流入 GameStop 和 AMC 的资金规模不如 2021 年迷因股热潮高峰时那么高，但大量 **机构投资者** 的参与表明其影响更广泛。这一轮迷因股交易的复苏，以及之前热潮中关键人物的回归，凸显了社交媒体和零售投资者协调行动在当前金融市场中持续的影响力。

# GameStop and AMC shares surge for second day in ‘meme stock’ revival

Shares in **video game retailer** **GameStop** and **cinema group** **AMC Entertainment** soared for a second day on Tuesday, as a resurgence of trading interest in **"meme stocks"** took hold. The surge was sparked by the re-emergence of **retail trader** **Keith Gill**, known as **"Roaring Kitty"**, who had been a central figure in the **2020-2021 meme stock frenzy**. 

**Trading volumes** for GameStop and AMC witnessed substantial increases, with Monday's volumes reaching 15 and 20 times their respective 20-day averages. This resulted in significant gains for both stocks: GameStop climbed 63% and AMC jumped 78% in early trading, following on from the previous day's gains of 73% and 77%, respectively. 

The phenomenon of **"meme stocks"** refers to the trend of retail investors coordinating on social media platforms like **Reddit's wallstreetbets** to invest in struggling companies, often targeting those heavily **shorted by hedge funds**. This strategy, employed by a community of retail investors during the pandemic, particularly those receiving government stimulus cheques, resulted in significant losses for hedge funds like **Melvin Capital**, which had short positions in stocks like GameStop. 

While the inflows into GameStop and AMC during this week's rally are lower than the peak of the meme stock frenzy in 2021, the involvement of institutional investors in large numbers suggests a broader impact. This resurgence of **"meme stock"** trading, fueled by the return of a key figure from the previous rally, underscores the ongoing influence of social media and retail investor coordination in today's financial markets.
