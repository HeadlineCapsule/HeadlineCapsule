# 据《金融时报》调查显示，随着通胀担忧加剧，**乔·拜登**的经济政策支持率下降

---

**乔·拜登**的连任前景面临挑战，因为一项新的《**金融时报**》-密歇根罗斯调查显示，80% 的选民认为物价高企是重大经济担忧。这种情绪转变导致人们对拜登处理经济问题的能力认可度下降，58% 的人不认可，只有 28% 的人认为他的政策产生了积极影响。调查还表明，选民们在经济问题上更信任 **唐纳德·特朗普**，并在谁能更好地代表蓝领工人阶级利益的问题上存在教育分歧。随着 11 月大选的临近，选民将经济和通货膨胀列为关键问题，这给拜登赢得蓝领工人阶级选民的支持带来了挑战。

在最新的消费者价格指数数据公布之前，密歇根大学美国消费者信心关键指数降至去年 11 月以来的最低水平，原因是通胀预期恶化。联邦数据显示，**个人消费支出指数**在 3 月上升至 2.7%，高于 **美联储** 2% 的目标，这给大幅降息的希望泼了冷水，并使借贷成本居高不下。除了通货膨胀之外，选民们还表示担心收入和住房成本，分别有 49% 和 32% 的受访者将这些列为经济压力源。

《金融时报》-密歇根罗斯民调对 1003 名注册选民进行了在线调查，突显出拜登在获得选民对经济政策认可方面面临的挑战，尤其是在通货膨胀和蓝领工人阶级代表权方面。

# Support for Joe Biden’s economic policies wanes amid inflation fears, FT poll finds

---

**Joe Biden's** re-election prospects are facing challenges as a new **FT-Michigan Ross poll** reveals that 80% of voters consider high prices as a significant financial concern. This shift in sentiment has led to a decrease in approval of Biden's handling of the economy, with 58% disapproving, and only 28% believing that his policies have had a positive impact. The survey also indicates that voters trust **Donald Trump** more on economic issues, and there is a divide based on education level regarding who better represents the interests of blue-collar workers. With the election approaching in November, voters rank the economy and inflation as key issues, creating an uphill battle for Biden to win over working-class Americans.

With the latest consumer price index numbers pending, the University of Michigan's key index of US consumer sentiment has dropped to its lowest level since November due to worsening inflation expectations. Federal data shows that the **personal consumption expenditures index** rose to 2.7% in March, above the **Federal Reserve's** 2% target, dampening hopes for significant rate cuts and keeping borrowing costs high. In addition to inflation, voters expressed concerns about income and housing costs, with 49% and 32% of respondents, respectively, citing these as financial stressors.

The FT-Michigan Ross poll, conducted online with 1,003 registered voters, highlights the challenges Biden faces in gaining economic approval from voters, particularly regarding inflation and blue-collar worker representation.
