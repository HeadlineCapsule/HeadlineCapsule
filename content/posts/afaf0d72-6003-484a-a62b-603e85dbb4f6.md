亚马逊英国仓库员工将投票决定是否加入工会

**亚马逊英国仓库工人投票支持工会代表** 

位于考文垂的亚马逊仓库工人即将投票决定是否希望由 GMB 工会代表。这次投票涉及到四分之一以上的员工，结果将于 7 月 15 日公布。如果投票获得至少 40% 的员工支持，亚马逊将不得不承认工会并建立英国首次集体谈判安排。

多年来，GMB 一直在努力代表这家电子商务巨头在英国的业务员工。在未来两周内，GMB 和亚马逊管理层都将与小型工人团体举行会议，然后进行投票。该公司因其在国内和国际市场上对待工人的方式而受到审查，被 GMB 高级组织者 Amanda Gearing 指责为世界上对工会最敌对的雇主之一。

亚马逊声称重视与员工的直接关系，并通过日常对话和参与来实现这一点，同时表示在过去两年里，英国起薪提高了 20%。该公司还否认任何破坏工会的战术，坚称考文垂配送中心的员工人数一段时间以来一直保持稳定。

这次投票是在亚马逊斯塔滕岛仓库工人成为 2022 年第一家赢得工会代表权的仓库之后进行的。然而，自那时以来，其他地点的类似努力失败了，新成立的亚马逊劳工联盟尚未与该公司签订代表其成员谈判的合同。

这次投票的结果也可能增加对亚马逊美国业务的压力，因为在过去几周里，亚马逊劳工联盟与较大的团队斯特工会建立了联系。

 **Amazon UK Warehouse Workers Vote for Union Representation**  

Workers at an Amazon warehouse in Coventry are set to vote on whether they want union representation from the GMB union. The results of this ballot involving over cuartero staff will be announced on July 15th, and if it passes with a minimum of 40% employee support, it would compel Amazon to recognize the union and establish collective bargaining arrangements for the first time in Britain.

The GMB has been campaigning for years to represent employees at this ecommerce giant's UK operations. Both the GMB and Amazon management will hold meetings with small groups of workers over the next two weeks before the vote takes place. The company, which has faced scrutiny regarding its treatment of workers in both domestic and international markets, is accused by Amanda Gearing, a senior organizer at the GMB, as being one of the world's most hostile employers against unions.

Amazon claims to value direct relationships with employees through daily conversations and engagement while stating that it has increased minimum starting pay in the UK by 20% over the past two years. The company also denies any union-busting tactics, asserting that employee numbers at the Coventry fulfillment center have remained constant for some time.

This vote comes after Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse in New York City became the first to win union representation in 2022. However, similar bids at other sites have since failed and the newly formed Amazon Labor Union does not yet have a contract with the company for negotiating on behalf of its members.

The outcome of this vote could potentially increase pressure on Amazon's US operations as well, following the affiliation between the Amazon Labor Union and the larger Teamsters union in recent weeks.
