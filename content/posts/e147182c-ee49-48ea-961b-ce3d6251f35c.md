能源公司高管呼吁进行紧急改革以实现英国的绿色目标

# 苏格兰电力公司首席执行官呼吁进行紧急改革以帮助英国实现其绿色能源目标

苏格兰电力公司（Scottish Power）首席执行官基思·安德森（Keith Anderson）是首相里希·苏纳克（Rishi Sunak）商业顾问委员会的成员，他呼吁进行紧急改革以帮助英国实现其绿色能源目标。他强调了规划延误和技能短缺等问题，这些问题阻碍了该国向氢能工厂和电力线路等可再生能源来源的过渡。

安德森强调了流程变革的必要性，包括对规划系统的改革，他认为这可以带来显著变化而不会产生额外成本。他还表达了对技能短缺的担忧，如果不迅速解决，这可能会成为主要限制因素。英国致力于在2050年实现净零排放并在2035年实现电力系统去碳化，而工党则提出了更加雄心勃勃的目标——2030年。

反对党提议建立一家新的国有能源公司，通过与私营部门共同投资来促进可再生能源的发展。然而，安德森敦促他们关注成熟度较低的技术和领域，政府干预在这里可以产生最大影响。他还警告说，如果西班牙或美国等国在绿色转型方面行动更快，投资可能会流向那里而不是英国。

保守党和工党都回应了安德森的担忧，强调了他们各自实现去碳化目标和支持可再生能源增长的计划。

 **Summary of Article:**

Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power and a member of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's council of business advisers, has called for urgent reforms to help the UK meet its green energy targets. He highlighted issues such as planning delays and skills shortages that are hindering the country'amoon transition towards renewable energy sources like hydrogen plants and electricity cables.

Anderson emphasized the need for changes in processes, including reforms to the planning system, which he believes could make a significant difference without incurring additional costs. He also expressed concerns about skills shortages that may become a major constraint if not addressed promptly. The UK is legally committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and decarbonizing the electricity system by 2035, with Labour aiming for an even more ambitious target of 2030.

The opposition party has proposed setting up a new state-owned energy company to boost renewables through co-investments alongside the private sector. However, Anderson urged them to focus on less mature technologies and areas where government intervention can have the most significant impact. He also warned that if other countries like Spain or America move faster in their green transition efforts, investment may flow there instead of the UK.

Both Conservative and Labour parties have responded to Anderson's concerns by highlighting their respective plans for achieving decarbonization targets and supporting renewable energy growth.
