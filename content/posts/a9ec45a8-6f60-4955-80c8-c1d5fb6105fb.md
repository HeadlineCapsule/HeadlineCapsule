# 英国通胀率预计将低于欧元区和美国

根据路透社调查的经济学家预测，**英国通胀率**将在 4 月下降至 2.1%，低于**英格兰银行**（**英央行**）设定的 2% 目标，并较 3 月 3.2% 的水平大幅下降。这主要归因于**天然气批发价格**下跌后，**家庭能源价格监管上限**降低了 12%。如果预测准确，这将是英国通胀率连续第二个月低于美国，也是自 2022 年 3 月以来首次低于美国和**欧元区**。

这些数据加剧了**英央行**决策者之间关于何时降低目前 16 年来最高 5.25% 利率的争论。一些官员主张在 6 月会议时就降低利率，而金融市场则预测首次降息将发生在 8 月。较低的通胀率可能对**首相里希·苏纳克**有所助益，因为在英国经济从去年衰退中复苏之际，第一季度增长率为两年来的最高水平 0.6%。

然而，价格增长放缓尚未缩小**工党**在民意调查中对保守党的 20 个百分点的领先优势。总体而言，自 2021 年 3 月以来，英国消费者价格上涨了 22%，欧元区通胀率为 2.4%，美国为 3.4%。**Consensus Economics** 预测，随着美国经济的强劲发展可能引发通胀并推迟**美联储**首次降息，英国通胀率在今年剩余时间将继续低于美国。

**英央行**行长**安德鲁·贝利**强调，一个关键的考虑因素是更高的工资是否会转嫁给消费者，而最新数据表明可能并非如此。

# UK set for slower inflation than Eurozone and US 

**UK inflation** is predicted to fall to 2.1% in April, according to forecasters polled by Reuters, pushing it below the **Bank of England's** (**BoE**) target of 2% and marking a significant drop from March's figure of 3.2%. This is largely due to a 12% decrease in the regulatory cap on **household energy bills**, which followed a decline in **wholesale gas prices**. If forecasts are accurate, this will be the second consecutive month that UK inflation has been lower than that of the US, and the first time since March 2022 that it has been lower than both the US and the **Eurozone**. 

These figures fuel the debate among **BoE** policymakers about when to cut interest rates from their current 16-year high of 5.25%. Some officials advocate for a reduction as soon as the June meeting, while financial markets predict the first cut will occur in August. Lower inflation could provide a boost to **Prime Minister Rishi Sunak**, as the UK economy rebounds from last year's recession with a growth rate of 0.6% in the first quarter, the fastest in two years. 

However, the slowing price growth has not yet closed the **Labour Party's** consistent 20-point polling lead over the Tories. Overall, UK consumer prices are still up 22% since March 2021, with inflation at 2.4% in the Eurozone and 3.4% in the US. **Consensus Economics** predicts that UK inflation will remain lower than US inflation for the rest of the year as a resilient US economy threatens inflation and delays the first-rate reduction by the **Fed**. 

**Andrew Bailey**, governor of the **BoE**, emphasized that a key consideration is whether higher wages are being passed on to consumers, and the latest data suggests this may not be the case.
