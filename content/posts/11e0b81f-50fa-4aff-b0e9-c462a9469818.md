# 尽管赞扬哈维尔·米莱，国际货币基金组织仍暂缓对阿根廷的新贷款

**阿根廷** 请求 **国际货币基金组织**（**IMF**） 提供额外贷款，但得到的回应谨慎，尽管基金组织承认该国在总统哈维尔·米莱（Javier Milei）领导下经济表现有所改善。国际货币基金组织赞扬阿根廷实现了经济目标，根据现有的贷款计划拨款8亿美元。然而，鉴于阿根廷是该基金最大债务国，基金组织不愿意批准额外资金。**米莱政府**实施了严格的措施，包括**削减财政赤字**、**社会支出削减**和**暂停公共工程**，使该国自2008年以来首次实现季度基础财政盈余。 

米莱的目标是对外筹集150亿美元资金，以取消阻碍经济增长的资本管制。尽管他的政府在国会中处于弱势地位，但已成功在众议院通过了经济改革和税收法案。阿根廷的经济危机仍在继续，实际工资和消费者支出下降，抗议活动不断。国际货币基金组织预测2024年阿根廷 GDP 将萎缩2.8%。分析人士表示，除非米莱的改革能证明其可持续性，否则不太可能达成新的贷款协议，2025年的中期选举被视为一个关键的里程碑。国际货币基金组织的声明赞扬了阿根廷政府的努力，但8亿美元的拨款仍需得到董事会批准。

# IMF Holds Off on Fresh Argentina Loan Despite Praise for Javier Milei 

**Argentina's request** for an additional loan from the **IMF** has been met with a cautious response, despite the Fund's acknowledgment of the country's improved economic performance under President Javier Milei. The IMF commended Argentina's achievement of its economic targets, leading to a $800 million disbursement as per the existing loan program. However, the Fund is hesitant to approve extra funds, given Argentina's status as its largest debtor. **Milei's administration** has implemented stringent measures, including **slashing fiscal deficit**, **social spending cuts**, and **suspension of public works**, resulting in the country's first quarterly primary fiscal surplus since 2008.

Milei aims to raise $15 billion externally to remove capital controls, a barrier to economic growth. While his government holds a weak position in congress, it has managed to pass economic reform and tax hike bills through the lower house. Argentina's economic crisis persists, with real wages and consumer spending declining and protests mounting. The IMF predicts a 2.8% GDP shrinkage in 2024. Analysts suggest that a new loan agreement is unlikely until Milei's reforms demonstrate sustainability, with the 2025 midterm elections seen as a crucial milestone. The IMF's statement praised the government's efforts, but the $800 million disbursement is still subject to board approval.
