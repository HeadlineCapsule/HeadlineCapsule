6.68亿美元贷款助力迈阿密豪华房产市场蓬勃发展

# 6.68亿美元贷款创纪录，助力迈阿密豪华住房热潮

房地产开发商PMG为沃尔夫冈·阿斯托里亚住宅项目获得6.68亿美元的住宅建设贷款，创下佛罗里达州历史新高。这是该州有史以来最大的贷款，超过了去年西皮里尼住宅贷款的6亿美元。

这座1000英尺高的塔楼是迈阿密豪华住房市场热潮的一部分，完工后将成为除纽约市以外美洲南部最高的建筑。在疫情期间，富裕个人涌入迈阿密，寻求更好的天气、优惠的税收和较宽松的疫情限制措施，推动了高端公寓的需求。

**关键点：**

1. 为PMG的沃尔夫冈·阿斯托里亚住宅项目提供了6680万美元的贷款，打破了佛罗里达州以前6亿美元的纪录。
2. 尽管持续存在疫情和经济不确定性，但豪华住房市场仍然强劲。
3. 富裕个人对迈阿密的需求旺盛，导致豪华房产短缺。
4. 公寓价格在整个城市上涨，沃尔夫冈塔中的单元从100万美元的工作室到约9000万美元的顶层公寓不等。
5. 建筑开始前，超过90%的公寓已售出，表明市场需求强劲，投资者信心充足。
6. 该贷款旨在覆盖项目完成，预计银行OZK和相关基金管理公司将提供资金。
7. 迈阿密房地产市场表现出韧性，尽管过去曾出现过繁荣和衰退，开发商认为强大的经济基础是一个贡献因素。
8. 佛罗里达州规定在施工前必须出售公寓单元，以确保资本化和充足的需求，使市场对贷款人更安全。
9. 迈阿密豪华住房市场的客户群比以前的低谷时期更加稳定，买家寻求主要住所而不是二级或度假房屋。

 **Record $668mn loan boosts Miami luxury housing boom**

A new record has been set in Florida's history with the securing of a $668 million residential construction loan for The Waldorf Astoria Residences by property developer PMG. This marks the largest loan ever recorded in the state, surpassing the previous year's Cipriani Residences loan at $600 million.

The 1,000-foot tower is part of Miami's luxury housing market boom and will be the tallest building in the Americas south of New York City upon completion. The demand for high-end condominiums has been driven by an influx of wealthy individuals seeking better weather, favorable taxes, and looser Covid restrictions during the pandemic.

**Key Points:**

1. **$668 million loan** secured for PMG's Waldorf Astoria Residences in Miami, breaking Florida's previous record of $600 million.
2. The luxury housing market remains strong despite the ongoing pandemic and economic uncertainties.
3. High demand from wealthy individuals moving to Miami has led to a shortage of luxury properties.
4. **Condo prices** have risen across the city, with units in the Waldorf tower ranging from $1 million for studios up to about $90 million for penthouses.
5. More than 90% of the condos were sold even before construction began, indicating strong market demand and investor confidence.
6. The loan is intended to cover the completion of the project, expected in amoled by Bank OZK and Related Fund Management.
7. Miami's real estate market has shown resilience despite its history of booms and busts, with developers citing strong economic fundamentals as a contributing factor.
8. Florida regulations mandating the sale of condo units before construction ensures capitalization and adequate demand, making the market safer for lenders.
9. The customer base in Miami's luxury housing market is more stable than during previous downturns, with buyers seeking primary residences rather than secondary or vacation homes.
