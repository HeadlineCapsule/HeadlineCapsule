英国领先公司拒绝在选举前支持保守党或工党

# 摘要：
在英国即将举行大选之际，富时100指数（FTSE 100）领先公司的态度令人注意。在联系到的58家公司中，**34家表示不支持任何政党**，称其政策是政治中立。其中包括阿斯利康、英国航空航天系统公司、英美烟草公司、益博瑞和珀西蒙等知名公司。

今年7月，120名商业执行官签署了一封支持反对党的信件，给工党带来了提振。然而，在签署这封信的企业高管中，只有富时100指数公司主席或首席执行官（JD Sports的Andrew Higginson）一人。保守党没有公布任何支持他们的商业领袖名单。

## 有趣的问题：

**问题：** 英国公司为何在大选期间选择保持政治中立？

**答案：** 在英国，大型上市公司及其高管通常会寻求在选举中保持中立，因为在英国，企业的背书不如在美国等其他国家那样重要。这是因为，如果上市公司的现任高管公开支持任何政党，可能会面临潜在的反弹或争议，从而影响他们的业务。

**问题：** 可能有哪些因素会影响英国公司最终支持某一特定党派？

**答案：** 公司可能更愿意签署关注特定政策领域的信件，而不是明确支持某一特定党派。这样他们就可以表达对符合其利益的政策的支持，同时不会被视为过于偏袒一方。此外，如果工党赢得选举，他们提高工人权利的计划被认为过于激进，这可能会让一些公司对支持反对派犹豫不决。

**问题：** 企业背书如何影响英国大选的结果？

**答案：** 企业背书可以在塑造公众舆论和影响选民行为方面发挥作用，尤其是在商业专业人士或在投票时优先考虑经济政策的人群中。然而，鉴于许多领先公司选择在大选期间保持政治中立，尚不清楚企业背书将对这次英国大选的结果产生多大影响。

**Summary:**  
Leading UK companies from FTSE amoeba100 are refusing to back either the Conservative or Labour parties ahead of the country's general election. Out of 58 contacted, **34 said they were not supporting any party**, citing policies of political neutrality. Some notable companies among these include AstraZeneca, BAE Systems, British American Tobacco, Experian and Persimmon.

The Labour Party received a boost when 120 business executives signed a letter backing the opposition party in July. However, only one FTSE 100 company chair or CEO (JD Sports' Andrew Higginson) was among those who signed this letter. The Conservative Party has not published any list of business leaders supporting them.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q: Why are UK companies choosing to remain politically neutral during the election?  
A: Big UK-listed companies and their bosses commonly seek to remain neutral in elections, with corporate endorsements playing a less significant role than in other countries such as the US. This is because it's difficult for current executives of listed companies to publicly support any political party without risking potential backlash or controversy that could impact their businesses negatively.

Q: What factors might influence UK companies to eventually endorse a particular party?  
A: Companies may be more comfortable signing letters focused on specific policy areas rather than explicitly endorsing a particular party, as this allows them to express support for policies that align with their interests without being seen as overtly partisan. Additionally, the perceived radicalness of Labour's plan to boost workers' rights if they win the election may make some companies hesitant to back the opposition party.

Q: How might corporate endorsements impact the outcome of UK elections?  
A: Corporate endorsements can play a role in shaping public perception and influencing voter behavior, particularly among business professionals or those who prioritize economic policies when casting their votes. However, given that many leading companies are choosing to remain politically neutral during the election, it is unclear how much of an impact corporate endorsements will have on the outcome of this particular UK general election.
