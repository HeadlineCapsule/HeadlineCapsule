被指控在欧洲参与**俄罗斯影响力行动**的**乌克兰公民**阿尔捷姆·马切夫斯基（Artem Marchevskyi）已逃匿，并宣称自己清白无辜。马切夫斯基是亲俄媒体大亨维克多·梅德韦丘克（Viktor Medvedchuk）的关联人，捷克当局指控两人共同建立了一个名为**《欧洲之声》**的在线媒体，在**2019年欧洲议会选举**前影响欧洲政客。此事已引发包括波兰、德国和比利时在内的多个欧洲国家展开**情报调查**，调查内容涉及当选官员与两人的潜在联系。

# Ukrainian suspect in Russian influence case goes into hiding

Artem Marchevskyi, a **Ukrainian national** accused of involvement in a **Russian influence campaign** in Europe, has gone into hiding, proclaiming his innocence. Marchevskyi was an associate of pro-Russia media mogul Viktor Medvedchuk, and both are alleged by Czech authorities to have established **Voice of Europe**, an online outlet used to influence European politicians ahead of the **2019 European Parliament elections**. This has prompted **intelligence investigations** in several European countries, including Poland, Germany, and Belgium, into potential links between elected officials and the pair. 

**Medvedchuk**, currently residing in Moscow and with close ties to **Russian President Vladimir Putin**, is accused of using Marchevskyi as a proxy to carry out the influence campaign. Marchevskyi denies this, claiming to have had no involvement in Voice of Europe's management and only providing "third-party contracting" services. He praises the outlet, now taken down, for its critical stance against the Czech government and "globalist elites." 

Marchevskyi's whereabouts are currently unknown, but it is believed he left the Czech Republic for Slovakia, where he may have received protection from the nationalist government. The **Slovak Interior Ministry** is investigating his case. The **Czech intelligence service** continues its probe, with potential criminal charges and sanctions against Marchevskyi and Medvedchuk in relation to Russia's war in Ukraine. The case also implicates far-right and ultraconservative politicians across Europe, with German authorities investigating Petr Bystron, a leading candidate for the **AfD**, and Belgian officials looking into other European Parliament members.
