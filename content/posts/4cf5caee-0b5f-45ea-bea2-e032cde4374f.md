摩根士丹利将与高盛和摩根大通一起取消英国奖金上限

摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）加入高盛和摩根大通的行列，取消了英国奖金上限。

在脱欧后旨在提升伦敦金融行业的变革之后，摩根士丹利决定改变其薪酬结构，取消之前对银行家奖金的上限。这一决定与**高盛**和**摩根大通**的类似举动一致，因为它们根据英国取消奖金上限（该上限限制奖金不超过基本工资的两倍）来调整他们的薪酬政策。该上限于2014年在整个欧盟引入。

该银行尚未通知其员工有关此更改的信息，但表示将用“适当的内部奖金上限”来取代之前的上限，但没有提供有关其结构的更多细节。摩根士丹利强调，他们将继续根据《金融时报》的声明，支付具有竞争力的工资并奖励优异表现。

英国去年决定取消奖金上限，这是脱欧后推动伦敦在全球金融市场中地位提升的一部分。预计大多数美英银行将修订他们的薪酬政策，这可能会影响伦敦招聘顶尖银行家的竞争格局。

在摩根士丹利遵循高盛和摩根大通的脚步之后，花旗集团也在寻求监管机构批准类似的更改。然而，一些欧洲银行表达了担忧，因为他们仍然受到欧盟规则的限制，即奖金不超过固定工资的两倍，这可能会使他们在招聘顶尖人才时处于劣势。

自奖金上限引入以来，银行家们一直要求更高的整体薪酬待遇，导致批评者质疑取消上限是否会对工资水平产生重大影响。高盛和摩根大通采取了不同的新薪酬结构方法：高盛选择降低基本工资，同时将奖金比例提高到收入的25倍，而摩根大通则保持固定工资不变，但允许奖金最高可达收入的10倍。

 **Morgan Stanley** joins Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in scrapping UK bonus cap  

In a move following post-Brexit changes aimed at boosting London's financial sector, Morgan Stanley has decided to alter its pay structure by removing the previously mandated limit on banker bonuses. This decision aligns with similar moves made by **Goldman Sachs** and **JPMorgan Chase & Co**., as they adapt their compensation policies in response to the UK's removal of a cap that limited bonuses to two times base salary, introduced across the EU in 
2014.  

The bank has not yet informed its staff about this change but stated it would replace the limit with "an appropriate internal bonus cap," without providing further details on how it will be structured. Morgan Stanley emphasized that they continue to pay competitively and reward strong performance, as per their statement to the Financial Times.  

The UK's decision to remove the bonus cap last year is part of a broader post-Brexit push aimed at enhancing London's position in the global financial marketplace. Most US and UK banks are expected to revise their pay policies, which could impact competition dynamics for hiring top bankers in London.  

While Morgan Stanley follows Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup is also seeking regulatory approval for a similar change. However, some European banks have expressed concerns that they are still restricted by EU rules on limiting bonuses to two times fixed pay, potentially making it more challenging for them to compete in hiring top talent.  

Since the bonus cap's introduction, bankers have demanded higher overall compensation packages, leading critics of removing the cap to question whether this change will significantly impact pay levels. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have adopted different approaches for their new pay structures: Goldman opting to lower base pay while increasing bonus ratios up to 25 times income, and JPMorgan maintaining fixed pay but allowing bonuses of up to ten times earnings.
