欧盟指控微软在团队合作方面违反了反垄断法

# 欧盟指控微软因 Teams 违反反垄断法

欧洲委员会指控微软将视频会议应用 Teams 与 Office 套件捆绑销售，违反了反垄断法。这是十多年来首次对这家科技巨头提出此类指控。欧盟担心微软可能通过将 Teams 与其广受欢迎的企业生产力套件结合在一起，为 Teams 提供“不公平优势”，从而损害 Slack 和 Zoom 等竞争对手。

**微软的回应**：微软总裁布拉德·史密斯表示，公司感谢这些指控提供的额外清晰度，并将致力于找到解决方案来解决委员会剩余的担忧。他们已经采取了措施，例如在欧洲将 Teams 从其他软件中剥离出来，但可能需要做更多工作。

欧洲委员会尚未对调查结果做出预判，如果被判有罪，微软可能面临高达其全球年度收入 10% 的罚款。此案正值微软因与其他公司合作（如 OpenAI）以及云计算领域涉嫌不公平许可协议而受到越来越多的审查之际。

欧盟还正在调查苹果，因为有指控称其 App Store 扼杀竞争，这是大科技公司首次根据新的数字规则面临指控。

 **EU Charges Microsoft with Antitrust Violangs Over Teams**

The European Commission has charged Microsoft for antitrust violations related to bundling its video conferencing app, Teams, with the Office suite. This marks the first such charges against the tech giant in over a decade. The EU is concerned that Microsoft may be giving Teams an "undue advantage" by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses, potentially harming competitors like Slack and Zoom.

**Microsoft's Response:** Brad Smith, Microsoft President, stated the company appreciates the additional clarity provided by the charges and will work on finding solutions to address the commission's remaining concerns. They have already taken steps such as unbundling Teams from other software in Europe but may need to do more.

The European Commission has not prejudged the outcome of its probe, which could result in a potential fine of up to 10% of Microsoft's annual global revenues if found guilty. This case comes amid increased scrutiny on Microsoft for other activities such as their partnership with OpenAI and alleged unfair licensing agreements for cloud computing.

The EU is also investigating Apple over accusations that it stifles competition in its App Store, marking the first time Big Tech companies have faced charges under new digital rules.
