# 英国城市部长批评监管机构的欺诈退款计划

英国**城市部长比姆·阿福拉米**强烈批评了**支付系统监管局（PSR）**提出的强制性规定，要求银行和支付公司向欺诈受害者退款，他指出该规定存在“重大问题”。 财政部与监管机构之间的紧张关系源于在管理金融风险的同时促进科技行业发展的愿望。 旨在保护欺诈受害者的拟议规定引发了人们对其可能影响小型支付系统提供商和鼓励犯罪活动的担忧。 争论的焦点是PSR的“授权推送支付”（**APP**）欺诈退款规则，行业机构警告称，这可能威胁到小型金融科技公司并导致欺诈活动增加。 财政部部长的公开批评反映了他们对监管机构未能充分解决其促进增长和竞争力的法律目标感到不满。 这个问题是关于监管机构在风险管理和行业发展之间平衡作用这一更广泛讨论的一部分，财政部寻求营造一个有利于增长的环境。

# UK City minister hits out at watchdog’s fraud refund plan

**Bim Afolami**, the UK's City minister, has expressed strong criticism of the **Payment Systems Regulator's (PSR)** proposal to mandate reimbursement of fraud victims by banks and payment companies, citing "significant problems" with the rules. This tension between the **Treasury** and regulators stems from a desire to foster growth in the tech sector while managing financial risks. The proposed rules, aimed at protecting fraud victims, have raised concerns about their potential impact on smaller payment system providers and the encouragement of criminal activity. The flashpoint is centered on the PSR's "authorized push payment" (**APP**) fraud reimbursement rules, with industry bodies warning of potential threats to smaller fintech companies and an increase in fraudulent activity. The Treasury ministers' public criticism reflects their frustration with watchdogs not adequately addressing their legal objective to promote growth and competitiveness. This issue is part of a broader discussion about the role of regulators in balancing risk management and industry development, with the Treasury seeking to foster a pro-growth environment.
