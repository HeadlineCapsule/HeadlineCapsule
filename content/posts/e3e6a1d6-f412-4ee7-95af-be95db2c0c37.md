万事达卡和维萨卡面临英国监管机构对商户费用的打击

# 英国监管机构审查万事达卡和维萨卡对商户费用的上涨

 ## **万事达**（MasterCard）和**维萨**（Visa），作为英国支付卡行业的领头羊，因大幅提高商户费用而受到该国 **支付系统监管局**（PSR）的审查。PSR 提出新规则，要求这两家公司披露更多关于这些费用的信息，并在变动前与商户协商。

### 关键点：
- Visa 和 Mastercard 控制着英国 95% 的借记卡和信用卡市场，在过去五年中，他们将**计划费用**和处理费用提高了30%以上，但服务质量却没有相应的改善迹象。
- 这些费用由商家支付，用于访问其网络和各种处理步骤，最终转嫁给消费者。
- PSR 总经理克里斯·汉姆斯利（Chris Hemsley）批评了缺乏透明度和导致零售商和消费者价格更高的激励结构。他建议披露定价方法并增加行业竞争。
- 像英国零售商协会（BRC）和小型企业联合会（FSB）这样的贸易组织一直呼吁降低卡费，称这给企业带来了巨大成本。他们敦促进行有意义的改革以提高透明度和减少费用。
- Visa 和 Mastercard 为他们的收费辩护，认为这些反映了其提供的价值，并强调他们在网络安全和弹性方面的投资。然而，万事达否认了 PSR 的调查结果，声称该行业高度竞争，而维萨则强调其对安全性、消费者保护和高质量服务的贡献。
- PSR 调查的另一个焦点是**互换费用**，呼吁限制跨境交易收费上限，这些收费在脱欧后被取消。 
 - 这种审查在其他国家也有类似行动；今年，万事达卡和维萨卡在美国同意降低其交易费，此前曾遭到反垄断诉讼。

### 问题与解答：

1. **为什么万事达卡和维萨卡的商户费用受到审查？**
   - 答：万事达卡和维萨卡在英國支付卡市场佔主导地位，他们大幅提高了向卖家收取的计划费和处理费。根据 PSR 的说法，这些提高的费用没有相应的服务质量改善作为理由，引发了对过度定价及其对零售商和消费者不利影响的担忧。

2. **费用上涨如何影响企业和消费者？**
   - 答：大幅提高費用增加了企業的財務負擔，尤其是小型零售商，他们看到销售额的一大部分被用于支付卡费。最终，这些成本可能会转嫁给消费者，导致商品和服务价格上涨。

3. **什么是 Interchange Fees（互換費用），为什么它们也引起了 PSR 的注意？**

## Mastercard and Visa Under Scrutiny by UK Watchdog for Merchant Fee Hikes

**Mastercard** and **Visa**, the dominant players in the UK's payment card industry, are facing scrutiny from the country's **Payment Systems Regulator (PSR)** over their substantial increases in merchant fees. The PSR has proposed new rules that would require the duo to share more information about these fees and consult with merchants before making changes.

### Key Points:
- Visa and Mastercard, which control 95% of the UK's debit and credit card market, have increased their scheme and processing **fees** by over 30% in the last five years, while there is little evidence of a corresponding improvement in service quality.
- These fees are charged to sellers for access to their networks and various processing steps, ultimately passed on to consumers.
- The PSR's managing director, Chris Hemsley, criticizes the lack of transparency and the incentive structure that leads to higher prices for retailers and consumers. He proposes disclosing pricing methodologies and increasing competition in the sector.
- Trade bodies like the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have campaigned for card **fee** reductions, citing significant costs to businesses. They urge meaningful reforms for increased transparency and reduced costs.
- Visa and Mastercard defend their fees as reflective of the value they provide, highlighting investments in cybersecurity and network resilience. However, Mastercard disagrees with the PSR's findings, stating that the industry is highly competitive, while Visa emphasizes its contributions to security and consumer protections.
- The PSR's investigation also focuses on **interchange fees**, calling for a cap on cross-border transaction charges previously removed after Brexit. 
- This scrutiny mirrors similar actions in other countries; Visa and Mastercard agreed to lower their transaction fees in the US this year following an antitrust lawsuit. 

### Questions & Answers:

1. Why are Visa and Mastercard's merchant fees under scrutiny?
   - Answer: Visa and Mastercard, which dominate the UK payment card market, have significantly increased their scheme and processing fees charged to sellers. These increases are not justified by improvements in service quality, according to the PSR, raising concerns about excessive pricing and negative impacts on retailers and consumers.

2. How do these fee increases affect businesses and consumers?
   - Answer: The substantial fee hikes add to the financial burden on businesses, especially small retailers who see a portion of each sale go towards card fees. Ultimately, these costs can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services.

3. What are interchange fees, and why have they also drawn attention from the PSR?
   - Answer: **Interchange fees** are charges passed on to banks as part of the payment card processing system. While the current focus is on scheme and processing fees that go directly to Visa and Mastercard, interchange fees have attracted scrutiny in the past due to their impact on overall costs for sellers and potential anti-competitive effects.

4. What actions are trade bodies like the BRC and FSB taking regarding these fee increases?
   - Answer: Trade bodies such as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have actively campaigned for reductions in card fees, highlighting the significant financial impact on businesses. They urge the PSR to implement meaningful reforms that increase competition, transparency, and cost reduction in the sector.

5. How have Visa and Mastercard responded to the allegations?
   - Answer: Both companies defend their fee structures as reflective of the value they bring to the payment card ecosystem, particularly regarding cybersecurity and network resilience investments. However, they differ in their responses; Mastercard disagrees with the PSR's findings, emphasizing the competitiveness of the industry, while Visa highlights its contributions to security, consumer protections, and high-quality services.

6. What is the ultimate goal of the PSR's investigation and
