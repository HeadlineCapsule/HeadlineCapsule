# 希音会重振伦敦股市吗？

**希音**，这家快时尚零售商，正在考虑将其首次公开募股（IPO）的计划从纽约转移到伦敦。 美国和中国之间的紧张关系，以及对希音与中国关系的担忧，使其纽约野心受阻。 这家估值约为**660亿美元**的公司可以为伦敦市场带来急需的提振，伦敦市场最近输给了规模更大、流动性更强的美国交易所。 伦敦证券交易所也取得了一些胜利，例如 Raspberry Pi 最近宣布在伦敦上市，但希音上市将是一次重大胜利。

与此同时，**汇丰银行**和**德勤**因英国新的签证规定而撤销了对外国毕业生的工作邀请，这些规定旨在遏制合法移民。 英国政府最近提高了技术工人签证的薪资门槛，导致企业措手不及，毕业生感到失望，面临着不确定的未来。

在其他新闻中，**巴西石油公司**首席执行官简保罗·普拉特斯（Jean Paul Prates）因与巴西左翼政府关系紧张而被免职，还有多家公司高管变动和新人聘用方面的最新消息。

最后，为读者简要介绍了一些推荐的时事通讯。

# Will Shein revive London's stock market? 

**Shein**, the fast-fashion retailer, is considering a shift in its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) from New York to London. Tensions between the US and China, along with concerns over Shein's ties to China, have stalled its New York ambitions. The company, valued at about **$66bn**, could provide a much-needed boost to London's market, which has recently lost out to larger, more liquid US exchanges. The London Stock Exchange has seen some wins, such as Raspberry Pi's recent announcement to list, but a Shein listing would be a significant coup. 

Meanwhile, **HSBC** and **Deloitte** have withdrawn job offers to foreign graduates in the UK due to new visa rules aimed at curbing legal immigration. The UK government's recent increase in the salary threshold for skilled worker visas has left companies scrambling, with graduates left disappointed and facing an uncertain future. 

In other news, **Petrobras** CEO Jean Paul Prates has been ousted due to tensions with Brazil's left-wing administration, and there are updates on executive moves and new hires at various firms. 

Finally, a brief overview of recommended newsletters is provided for readers.
