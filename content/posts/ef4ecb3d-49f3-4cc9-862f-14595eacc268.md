香港以“颠覆国家政权罪”判处14名活动人士有罪

# 摘要：
香港法院在领土最大的国家安全审判中，判14名活动人士阴谋颠覆罪成立。两名被告无罪释放，他们的起诉方打算对此判决提出上诉。其余31名被告已认罪，将另行宣判。此案被视为香港自由的指标，也是北京和当地当局在2019年民主派抗议后进行政治镇压的体现。

# 问题：
## 此审判对香港未来民主运动有何影响？
这些活动人士的定罪向那些倡导香港更大自由和自治的人发出了强烈的信息，可能阻止进一步的异议。它还突显了北京通过《国家安全法》压制政治反对派的决心。这次审判可能会对香港的民主运动产生持久的影响，因为它会在活动家和公民中造成恐惧和不确定的氛围。

## 此判决对考虑在香港投资的外资企业有何影响？
这些知名政治人物的定罪可能会进一步损害香港作为全球金融中心的声誉，阻止外资企业在城市中投资或维持存在。这可能会对香港及其与国际市场的关系造成重大经济后果。

## “爱国者治港”规则在塑造香港政治格局方面扮演什么角色？
“爱国者治港”规则要求所有候选人必须经过北京的审查才能参加选举，有效地限制了反对派的参与和代表权，进一步巩固了亲北京势力权力，削弱了香港的民主进程。因此，它促成了一个越来越专制的政治格局，压制异议并破坏了城市的自治。

**Summary:**  
A Hong Kong court has convicted 14 activists of conspiracy to commit subversion in the territory's largest national security trial. Two defendants were acquitted, and their prosecution intends to appeal against these verdicts. The remaining 31 defendants pleaded guilty and will be sentenced at a later date. This case is seen as an indicator for freedoms in Hong Kong amidst political crackdown by Beijing and local authorities after the 2019 pro-democracy protests.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q: What implications does this trial have on the future of democratic movements within Hong Kong?  
A: The conviction of these activists sends a strong message to those advocating for greater freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong, potentially deterring further dissent. It also highlights Beijing's determination to suppress political opposition through the national security law. This trial could have long-lasting effects on democratic movements within Hong Kong by creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty among activists and citizens alike.

Q: How might this verdict impact foreign businesses considering investment in Hong Kong?  
A: The conviction of these prominent political figures may further tarnish Hong Kong's reputation as a global financial center, potentially deterring foreign businesses from investing or maintaining their presence in the city. This could have significant economic consequences for Hong Kong and its relationship with international markets.

Q: What role does the "patriots-only" rule play in shaping the political landscape of Hong Kong?  
A: The "patriots-only" rule, which requires all candidates to be vetted by Beijing before participaturation, effectively limits opposition participation and representation within the Legislative Council. This further consolidates power under pro-Beijing forces and diminishes democratic processes in Hong Kong. As a result, it contributes to an increasingly authoritarian political landscape that stifles dissent and undermines the city's autonomy.
