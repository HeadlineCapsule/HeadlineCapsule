# 为什么香港应该将债务重组重新列入立法议程

在**中国恒大集团**——一家负债超过 3000 亿美元的中国房地产开发商——的高调**清算**之后，香港**债务重组**的法律框架受到密切关注。该事件使外界关注到香港在解决**债务问题**上的选择有限，这往往导致**漫长的法庭诉讼**和对所有相关方产生的**不利结果**。律师和专家倡导制定一项**重组法案**，虽然该法案已经讨论了 20 多年，但一直被搁置。根据现行制度，**债权人**可以通过**清盘申请**追讨陷入困境的公司，这往往导致**回报不足**和**流程延长**。重组法案将包括一项**法定暂缓偿债**，防止债权人急于起诉，并授权**监督人**监督该过程。然而，一个挑战是该法案在多大程度上能够涵盖**中国大陆资产**，因为离岸债权人在收回在岸资产时目前面临困难。尽管存在这些复杂情况，从业者仍强调重组法案对增强香港在国际金融中心地位的重要性，并为所涉各方提供更有利选择。

# Why Hong Kong should put debt restructuring back on the legislative agenda

Hong Kong's legal framework for **debt restructuring** is under scrutiny following the high-profile **liquidation** of **Evergrande**, a Chinese property developer with over $300 billion in liabilities. The case has brought attention to the territory's limited options for resolving **debt problems**, which often result in **protracted court proceedings** and **negative outcomes** for all involved. Lawyers and specialists advocate for a **restructuring bill**, which has been discussed for over 20 years but repeatedly put on hold. The current system allows **creditors** to pursue distressed companies through **wind-up petitions**, often leading to **insufficient returns** and **prolonged processes**. A restructuring bill would include a **statutory moratorium**, preventing creditors from rushing to court and empowering a **supervisor** to oversee the process. However, a challenge lies in the extent to which such a bill could cover **mainland Chinese assets**, as offshore creditors currently face difficulties in recovering onshore assets. Despite these complexities, practitioners emphasize the importance of a restructuring bill to enhance Hong Kong's position among international financial centers and provide more favorable options for all parties involved.
