# 自疫情管控结束以来,英格兰近4,000人因违反Covid规则而被定罪

《金融时报》分析显示，自英格兰解除**新冠疫情**限制以来，已有数千人因违反**新冠疫情**规定被定罪；五分之四的定罪者年龄在 40 岁以下，即使在世界卫生组织宣布结束该项**健康紧急事件**后，许多检控仍在继续。英国政府发言人为这些决定进行了辩护，称他们在**疫情**期间优先考虑公众安全，而各警察部门则可以根据情况对罚款通知书（FPN）做出选择并提出质疑。

The Financial Times analysis reveals that thousands of people in England have been convicted for breaking Covid-19 rules since restrictions ended; four in five convictions were handed out to individuals under 40 years old and many prosecutions continue even after the WHO declared an end to the health emergency. The UK government spokesperson defended decisions, stating they prioritized public safety during pandemic with individual police forces making choices on FPNs which could be challenged if concerns arose.
