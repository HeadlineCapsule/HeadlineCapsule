# **欧盟复苏基金** 的利与弊

**欧盟复苏基金** 虽然不是欧盟的 "**汉密尔顿时刻** "，但开创了欧盟大规模共同举债的先河，却没有推动财政一体化。该基金的影响有好有坏：它平静了金融市场，但在大型经济体中的经济增长效应可忽略不计，其结构性改革的遗产也尚不确定。随着大部分资金仍有待发放，一些人希望将其延长至 2026 年之后，但这将需要对欧盟的长期预算和债务偿还做出艰难决定。尽管存在挑战，但欧盟很可能还会推出另一个大规模投资计划，因为在 **绿色转型** 等领域存在投资需求。

# Pluses and minuses of the EU recovery fund

The **EU recovery fund**, while not a **"Hamiltonian moment"** for the EU, has broken new ground with its scale of common EU borrowing, but it hasn't led to fiscal integration. The fund's impact is mixed: it calmed financial markets but had a negligible effect on economic growth in large economies, and its legacy of structural reform is uncertain. With most funds yet to be disbursed, some want to extend it beyond 2026, but this will require tough decisions on the EU's long-term budget and debt repayment. Despite challenges, another large-scale EU investment plan is likely, given the need for investments in areas like **green transition**.
