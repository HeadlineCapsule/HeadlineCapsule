# 我们不需要人工智能宣言，我们需要一部宪法

**人工智能**（AI）已经成为我们日常生活中不可或缺的一部分，从招聘决策到贷款申请和医疗诊断，无处不在。尽管人工智能可以带来突破和无偏见的决定，但作者作为该领域的首席科学家认为，目前人工智能的使用与**公民权利** **不相容**。

问题出在缺乏透明度和问责制上。人工智能算法做出的决策影响着人们的生活，然而这些选择往往不为人知，也没有解释为什么会得出特定的结果。这在人工智能被用于具有强有力宪法保护的领域时尤其令人担忧，例如招聘，在这个领域，如果人类询问年龄或生育计划将明显侵犯公民权利。

作者列举了人工智能可能被滥用的例子，例如自动解雇低生产力工人或根据性格特质筛选求职者。在贷款申请中，旨在优化贷款方财务回报的人工智能算法可以瞬间打破借款人的希望，没有解释或上诉的机会。

同样的担忧也适用于医疗保健部门，人工智能诊断和保险决策可以影响人们的生活，以及法律系统，获得律师和司法审查的权利是宪法保障的权利。

作者提议，我们不需要一部**人工智能宣言**，而是需要一部**宪法**，将人们视为有自身利益的“真正行为者”。他们建议建立一个框架，确保人工智能为我们自身利益行事，并将访问人工智能定义为一种公民权利，它只为我们的利益工作。这包括由独立、非营利组织持有数据和运行算法，并对受影响的个人承担受托责任。

总之，尽管人工智能带来了美妙的可能性，但其使用必须受到强大道德框架的约束，该框架保护公民权利，并确保其决策过程的透明度和问责制。

# We don't need an AI manifesto — we need a constitution

**Artificial intelligence** (AI) has become a fixture in our daily lives, from hiring decisions to loan applications and medical diagnoses. While AI can offer breakthroughs and unbiased decisions, the writer, a chief scientist in the field, argues that the current use of AI is **incompatible with civil rights**. 

The issue lies in the lack of transparency and accountability. AI algorithms make decisions that impact people's lives, yet these choices are often hidden from view, with no explanation as to why a particular outcome was reached. This is particularly concerning when **AI is used in areas with strong constitutional protections**, such as hiring, where a human asking about age or family planning would be a clear violation of civil rights. 

The writer gives examples of AI's potential misuse, such as automatically firing low-productivity workers or screening out job applicants based on personality traits. In loan applications, AI algorithms designed to optimize lenders' financial returns can dash borrowers' hopes in an instant, with no opportunity for explanation or appeal. 

The same concerns apply to the health sector, where AI-powered diagnostics and insurance decisions can affect people's lives, and in the legal system, where the right to a lawyer and judicial review is a constitutional guarantee. 

The writer proposes that instead of an **AI manifesto**, we need a **constitution** that treats people as "real actors" with self-interest. They suggest a framework that ensures AI acts in our self-interest and defines access to AI, working solely for our benefit, as a civil right. This includes independent, non-profit organizations holding data and running algorithms with a fiduciary responsibility to the individuals affected. 

In conclusion, while AI offers wonderful possibilities, its use must be governed by a strong ethical framework that protects civil rights and ensures transparency and accountability in its decision-making processes.
