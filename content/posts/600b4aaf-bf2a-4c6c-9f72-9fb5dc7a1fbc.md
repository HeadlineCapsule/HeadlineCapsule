## 拜登阻止公开与机密文件调查相关的音频记录

乔·拜登援引**行政特权**，阻止了他与特别顾问罗伯特·赫（Robert Hur）谈话的音频记录公开。罗伯特·赫曾调查过总统对**机密文件**的处理。白宫表示，此举是为了保护执法文件的**机密性**，防止其被用于**党派政治目的**。目前，人们对拜登的**执政能力**表示担忧，特别顾问的报告称拜登是一位“**年迈而记忆力差**”的老人。这份于2月份发布的报告引发了争议，人们开始质疑拜登的**年龄**和**精神敏锐度**，暴露了他寻求连任时的潜在弱点。拜登的反对者们抓住了这个问题不放，有些人指责白宫试图隐瞒总统日益衰退的精神状态。然而，拜登的支持者批评特别顾问的言论不恰当，拜登本人也进行了有力辩护。目前，谈话的文字记录已经公开，但音频记录仍被列为机密，突显了透明度与保护敏感信息之间的持续紧张关系。

这一事件是围绕拜登展开的持续政治风暴中的最新进展，白宫与共和党议员在信息公开和特别顾问报告的解释方面存在分歧。

# Joe Biden blocks release of audio from classified documents probe

Joe Biden has invoked **executive privilege** to block the release of audio recordings of his interviews with the **special counsel**, Robert Hur, who investigated the president's handling of **classified documents**. The White House cited the need to protect the **confidentiality** of law enforcement files and prevent their use for **partisan political purposes**. This decision comes amidst concerns about Biden's **fitness for office**, with the special counsel's report describing the president as an **"elderly man with a poor memory"**. The report, released in February, sparked controversy and raised questions about Biden's **age** and **mental acuity**, exposing a potential vulnerability as he seeks re-election. Biden's opponents have seized on the issue, with some accusing the White House of attempting to hide the president's declining mental state. However, Biden's allies have criticized the special counsel's statements as inappropriate, and the president has defended himself vigorously. The transcripts of the interviews have been released, but the audio recordings remain confidential, highlighting the ongoing tension between transparency and the protection of sensitive information.

This incident is the latest development in an ongoing political firestorm surrounding Biden, with the White House and Republican lawmakers clashing over the release of information and the interpretation of the special counsel's report.
