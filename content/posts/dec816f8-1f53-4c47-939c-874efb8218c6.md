# 创纪录的巴西洪水已致95人死亡，经济损失达10亿美元

**巴西**南部遭遇毁灭性洪水，目前已导致95人死亡，20多万人流离失所。**里奥格兰德**州（**Rio Grande do Sul**）的降雨量创纪录，**阿雷格里港**（**Porto Alegre**）的一个监测站在三天内记录了近**260毫米**的降雨量，这通常是两个月的降雨量。洪水造成重大破坏，**全国市镇联合会**（National Confederation of Municipalities）估计经济损失约**10亿美元**。

目前，消防员、民防单位、军队和志愿者纷纷参与救援和救济工作，救助被困者，包括被困在屋顶上的人。该州州长**爱德华多·莱特**（Eduardo Leite）呼吁实施一项雄心勃勃的援助计划，并将其比作“**马歇尔计划**”（Marshall Plan），以应对广泛的破坏，包括交通基础设施和农业生产受到的影响。

这些洪水也引起了巴西总统**路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦**（Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva）的关注，他承诺联邦政府将支持重建工作。这是该州去年遭遇的第四次类似灾难，科学家们将其归咎于**气候变化**，特别指出大西洋异常变暖造成了一个影响天气模式的高压区。州政府和联邦政府因缺乏应对此类气候相关紧急情况的准备而受到批评。

# Record Brazil Floods Kill 95 and Cause $1bn Damage 

Southern **Brazil** is facing devastating floods, with a death toll of 95 and over 200,000 people displaced. The state of **Rio Grande do Sul** is witnessing record-breaking rainfall, with one monitoring station in **Porto Alegre** recording almost **260mm** in just three days, an amount typically seen over two months. The floods have caused significant damage, with the **National Confederation of Municipalities** estimating economic losses of approximately **$1 billion**. The situation has prompted a widespread rescue and relief effort, with firefighters, civil defense units, the army, and volunteers rushing to aid those stranded, including people trapped on rooftops. The state's governor, **Eduardo Leite**, has appealed for an ambitious aid program, drawing comparisons to the **Marshall Plan**, to address the extensive damage, which has impacted transportation infrastructure and agricultural production. The floods have also attracted attention from Brazil's President, **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva**, who has pledged federal support for reconstruction. This disaster is the fourth of its kind to strike the state in the past year, and scientists attribute it to **climate change**, specifically citing abnormal warming in the Atlantic Ocean creating a high-pressure zone that influences weather patterns. The state and federal governments have been criticized for their lack of preparedness for such climate-related emergencies.
