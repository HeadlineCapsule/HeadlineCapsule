欧洲选举将是政治主流的艰难旅程。

**摘要：**
即将举行的欧洲选举对主流政党来说预计将充满挑战，极右翼团体在法国、意大利、匈牙利、奥地利和荷兰等多个欧盟成员国可能获得前所未有的席位和影响力。绿党和自由党可能会失去席位，导致欧洲议会更加两极分化和碎片化。人们仍然质疑这种向右的转变是结构性趋势还是对欧洲变局的情感反应。

极右翼政党受到脱欧失败的影响，他们并不是公开的反欧洲主义，而是对欧洲持怀疑或悲观态度。自2015-16年移民危机以来，移民问题发生了变化，主流政党在移民政策立场上变得更加谨慎，而极右翼政府则认识到欧洲需要移民来维持经济竞争力。

《欧洲绿色协议》可能受到极右翼崛起的最大影响，因为气候活动家和“伟大替代”右翼都担心灭绝，但他们的方法不同。由于美国总统选举对欧洲政治格局的潜在影响，这些选举的结果难以预测。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：唐纳德·特朗普获胜如何影响欧洲国家的极右翼政党？
   答案：唐纳德·特朗普的胜利可能会增强欧洲极右翼政党的气势，但他的不受欢迎和与欧洲战略利益的潜在冲突可能会迫使他们选择在意识形态上与他结盟或冒着在家中被视为“有用傻瓜”的风险。

2. 问题：哪些因素导致了欧洲主流政党和极右翼政府对移民态度的改变？
   答案：2015-16年移民危机最初推动了对极右翼的支持，但从那时起，主流政党在移民政策立场上变得更加谨慎。极右翼政府现在认识到欧洲需要移民来维持经济竞争力。这种态度转变导致公众对移民的焦虑情绪下降，并侧重于加强外部边界，而不是完全阻止移民。

3. 问题：《欧洲绿色协议》如何受到极右翼政党日益增长的影响，鉴于他们在气候变化问题上的不同观点？
   答案：气候活动家们迫切希望解决环境问题，而“伟大替代”右翼则担心移民和生育率的影响，这可能会影响《欧洲绿色协议》的未来。这两个群体都表现出紧迫感，但他们的方法不同，这可能导致在实施既能满足双方又能满足双方的政策方面面临挑战。

**Summary:**  
The upcoming European elections are expected to be challenging for mainstream political parties, with far-right groups likely gaining more seats and influence than ever before in several EU member states such as France, Italy, Hungary, Austria, and the Netherlands. The Greens and Liberals may lose seats, leading to a more polarized and fragmented European Parliament. Questions remain about whether this shift towards the right is a structural trend or an emotional reaction to Europe's changing fortunes.

The far-right parties have been shaped by Brexit's failure and are not openly anti-European, but rather Eurosceptic or Euro-pessimistic. The migration issue has evolved since the 2015-16 crisis, with mainstream parties becoming more cautious about their stance on migration policy and far-right governments realizing Europe's need for migrants to maintain economic competitiveness.

The European Green Deal may be most affected by the growing strength of the far right, as both climate activists and "Great Replacement" right fear extinction but differ in their approaches. The outcome of these elections is difficult to predict due to the influence of the US presidential election on Europe's political landscape.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. Q: How might a victory for Donald Trump impact far-right parties in European countries?  
A: A victory for Donald Trump could embolden European far-right parties, but his unpopularity and potential clashes with Europe's strategic interests may force them to choose between their ideological alliance with him or risk being seen as "useful idiots" at home.

2. Q: What factors have contributed to the changing attitudes towards migration among mainstream parties and far-right governments in Europe?  
A: The 2015-16 migration crisis initially fueled support for the far right, but since then, mainstream parties have become more cautious about their stance on migration policy. Far-right governments now understand that Europe needs migrants to maintain economic competitiveness. This shift in attitudes has led to decreasing public anxiety about migration and a focus on strengthening external borders rather than stopping migrants altogether.

3. Q: How might the European Green Deal be affected by the growing influence of far-right parties, given their differing views on climate change?  
A: The clash between climate activists' urgency to address environmental issues and the "Great Replacement" right's fear of migration and fertility impact may affect the future of the European Green Deal. Both groups share a sense of urgency but have different approaches, which could lead to challenges in implementing policies that satisfy both sides.
