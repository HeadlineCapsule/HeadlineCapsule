# 这波**黄金**牛市是中国制造 

## 摘要：

4月份，中国**黄金**市场的交易活动出现激增，**上海黄金交易所（SGE）**的日均交易量较前几个月几乎翻了一番。这场热潮推高了中国的黄金价格溢价，与伦敦国际基准价格相比每金衡盎司高出约85美元。近一年来一直存在这样的溢价，这是传统买家认为黄金是通货膨胀对冲和地缘政治紧张局势升级时避险资产所驱动的。此外，人民币可能贬值的猜测也推高了需求。中国投资者的购买热情为全球**黄金价格**提供了强劲支撑，最近黄金价格飙升至历史新高。随着经济和政治地理不确定性的加剧，黄金作为避风港资产的地位预计将在未来几个月推动其需求进一步增长。

# This Gold Rally Is Made In China 

## Summary:
China's **gold** market is experiencing a surge in trading activity, with the average daily trading volume on the **Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE)** almost doubling in April compared to previous months. This frenzy has led to a significant premium on gold prices in China, about $85 per troy ounce higher than the international benchmark in London. This premium has been persistent for nearly a year and is driven by traditional buyers viewing gold as an **inflation hedge** and a safe haven during rising geopolitical tensions. Additionally, speculation about potential **renminbi devaluation** contributes to the demand. The buying enthusiasm from Chinese investors provides strong support for global gold prices, which recently hit record highs. With economic and geopolitical uncertainties on the rise, gold's status as a haven asset is expected to drive further demand in the coming months.
