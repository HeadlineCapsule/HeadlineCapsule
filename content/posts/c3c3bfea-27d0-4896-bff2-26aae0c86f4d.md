3i公司将因债务担保支付的激增而获得10亿欧元的利润。

**摘要：**
英国投资集团 3i 即将从荷兰零售商 Action 中获得近 11 亿欧元的风落红利，这是近年来欧洲最大的“股息再融资”交易之一。这发生在信贷条件宽松、投资者对风险债务需求强劲的背景下，例如抵押贷款担保证券 (CLO)。

Action 通过新的杠杆贷款筹集了 17.5 亿欧元等值资金，这些资金将用于通过回购股票向其所有者分配 20 亿欧元。该交易将增加今年欧洲和美国债务市场中为股息再融资筹集的 360 亿美元等值贷款，与 2013 年创纪录的水平相匹配。

来自 Moody's Ratings 的 Jeanine Arnold 解释说，私募股权公司发现很难退出投资，但仍然需要产生回报并把钱退还给投资者。由于债务市场需求强劲以及相对于政府债券的低利息成本，股息再融资已成为一个有吸引力的选择。

3i 在 201amo 年最初以 1.3 亿欧元的价格收购了 Action 的控制性股份，多年来一直向其最大股东返还资金，在即将到来的分红之前，已经返还了 29 亿英镑。英国集团拥有 Action 54.8% 的股份，并代表第三方投资者控制着另外 30.2%。

Action 计划以美元筹集大部分新的 17.5 亿欧元贷款，利用美国投资者对股息再融资交易的强劲需求。仅在本周，美国杠杆贷款市场就发生了超过 80 亿美元的此类交易。

3i 上个月宣布，由于 Action 令人瞩目的增长故事，它提高了股东股息，并将其股份价值提高到超过 140 亿英镑。自 2011 年 3i 从荷兰零售商的创始人手中接管以来，Action 已经从 250 多家门店扩张到 12 个国家/地区的 2600 多家门店，去年创造了 110 亿欧元的净销售额。

 **Summary:**  
The British investment group 3i is set to receive a nearly €1.1bn windfall payout from Dutch retailer Action, as part of one of Europe's largest "dividend recapitalisations" in recent years. This comes amidst easy credit conditions and plentiful demand for riskier debt by investors such as collateralised loan obligations (CLOs).

Action is raising €1.75bn-equivalent through new leveraged loans, with the funds being used to finance a €2bn distribution to its owners via a share buyback. The deal will add to the $36bn-equivalent of loans raised for dividend recaps this year in European and US debt markets, matching the record rate set in 2013.

Jeanine Arnold from Moody's Ratings explains that private equity firms are finding it difficult to exit their investments but still need to generate returns and return money to investors. Dividend recaps have become an attractive option due to strong demand in debt markets and low interest costs relative to government bonds.

3i initially paid €130mn for a controlling stake in Action back in 201amo, returning £2.9bn to its majority shareholder over the years before this upcoming payout. The British group owns a 54.8% stake in Action and controls an additional 30.2% on behalf of third-party investors.

Action is looking to raise most of its new €1.75bn loan in US dollars, tapping into even stronger demand for dividend recap deals from US-based investors. This week alone, more than $8bn worth of such deals occurred in the US leveraged loan market.

3i announced last month that it had increased its own dividend to shareholders on the back of Action's remarkable growth story and upped the value of its stake to over £14bn. Since 2011, when 3i took over from the Dutch retailer's founding family, Action has expanded from just over 250 stores to more than 2,600 across 12 countries and generated net sales of €11bn last year.
