布鲁塞尔指控苹果违反欧盟竞争规则

# 欧盟指控苹果违反竞争规则

欧洲委员会指控科技巨头苹果限制其应用商店的竞争，从而违反了欧盟竞争规则。这是《数字市场法》（DMA）首次适用于大型科技公司。该法案旨在打破大型平台的垄断并支持初创企业。

如果被判有罪，苹果可能面临高达全球年度收入**10%**的处罚。如果重复违规，罚款金额可提高至**20%**。欧盟内部市场专员蒂埃里·布雷东（Thierry Breton）敦促苹果“采取不同行动”，遵守DMA规则。

欧洲委员会还宣布将调查苹果的开发人员费用是否违反了欧盟法规。这些费用包括对超过100万用户使用的应用程序每下载一次收取**50美分**的费用。新的调查将审查苹果是否对用户下载和安装替代应用商店以及开发人员“自由引导客户”的能力实施了过度限制。

苹果表示，为了遵守DMA，该公司根据开发人员和欧洲委员会的反馈进行了更改。该公司相信，在其新的商业条款下，超过**99%**的开发人员将支付相同或更少的费用。由于围绕新技术规则的不确定性，苹果最近推迟了在欧盟引入iPhone人工智能功能。

今年1月，苹果对iOS移动软件和应用商店进行了更改，以解决竞争问题。该公司还因抑制竞争对手音乐流媒体服务而遭到**18亿欧元**的罚款，目前正在欧盟法院对此提出质疑。

 **Brussels Accuses Apple of Breaking EU Competition Rules**

The European Commission has accused tech giant, **Apple**, of violating EU competition rules by limiting competition on its app store. This marks the first time that new digital regulations have been applied to a major technology company under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA is designed to break the dominance of large platforms and support start-ups.

If found guilty, Apple could face penaltamoents up to **10%** of its global annual revenue. This amount can increase to **20%** if the offense is repeated. Thierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, has urged Apple to "act different" and comply with DMA rules.

The European Commission also announced an investigation into whether Apple's developer fees violate bloc regulations. These fees include a charge of **50 cents** per download for apps used by more than 1 million people. The new probe will examine if Apple is imposing excessive restrictions on users downloading and installing alternative app stores, as well as developers' ability to "freely steer their customers."

Apple has stated that it has made changes in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission, aiming to comply with DMA. The company believes more than **99%** of developers would pay the same or less under its new business terms. Apple recently delayed introducing AI-enabled features on iPhones in the EU due to uncertainty surrounding new tech rules.

In January, Apple introduced changes to iOS mobile software and app store as part of efforts to address competition concerns. The company was also fined **€1.8 billion** this year for stifling competition from rival music streaming services, which it is currently contesting in EU courts.
