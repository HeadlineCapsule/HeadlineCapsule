# 台湾新任总统呼吁中国停止威胁和恐吓

台湾新任总统**赖清德**向北京伸出橄榄枝，敦促和平共处并结束军事恐吓。在就职演讲中，赖清德呼吁北京恢复旅游和学生交换项目，他提到台湾致力于维护台湾海峡的**和平与稳定**。尽管**中国共产党**（CCP）声称台湾是中国的一部分，并威胁要使用武力将其控制，赖清德仍表现出善意。赖的讲话呼应了他的前任**蔡英文**的言论，承诺“不屈服也不挑衅”，并坚持蔡英文做出的四个承诺，包括抵抗吞并，确保国家的未来由台湾人民决定。

赖的声明承认了**中华民国**（ROC）的存在，并强调了国家身份认同和台湾在全球角色的 중요性，特别是在半导体行业。而中国共产党拒绝承认中华民国，提及“台湾”往往表示支持台湾独立，这正是北京强烈反对的。如美国专家所指出的，赖试图与北京和解的努力可能不会成功，但他的努力受到了美国和日本的欢迎，两国均对赖表示祝贺，并表达了对维护该地区和平与稳定的支持。

# Taiwan's new president calls on China to end threats and intimidation 

**Lai Ching-te**, Taiwan's newly inaugurated president, has extended an olive branch to Beijing, urging peaceful coexistence and an end to military intimidation. In his inaugural address, Lai appealed to Beijing to resume tourism and student exchange programs, referring to Taiwan's commitment to maintaining **peace and stability** across the Taiwan Strait. This gesture of goodwill comes despite the **Chinese Communist Party's** (CCP) claims that Taiwan is part of China and its threats of force to bring it under control. Lai's address echoed the language of his predecessor, **Tsai Ing-wen**, pledging to "neither yield nor provoke" and uphold the four commitments made by Tsai, including resisting annexation and ensuring the country's future is decided by the Taiwanese people. 

Lai's statement, which acknowledged the existence of the **Republic of China** (ROC), also emphasized the importance of national identity and Taiwan's global role, particularly in the semiconductor industry. While the CCP refuses to recognize the ROC, references to "Taiwan" often signal support for Taiwanese independence, which Beijing vehemently opposes. Lai's attempts at reconciliation may fall flat with Beijing, as indicated by US experts, but they have been well-received by the US and Japan, who congratulated Lai and expressed support for maintaining peace and stability in the region.
