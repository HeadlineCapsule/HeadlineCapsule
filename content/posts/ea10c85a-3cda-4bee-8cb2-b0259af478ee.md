乔·拜登缩小了唐纳德·特朗普在处理美国经济方面的领先优势。

# 《金融时报》 - 密歇根罗斯商学院民调总结：拜登和特朗普的经济政策

金融时报和密歇根大学罗斯商学院最近进行的一项民意调查显示，选民对谁能更好地处理美国经济的信任出现转变。5月30日至6月3日进行的这项调查表明，**唐纳德·特朗普领先乔·拜登**的幅度从2月的11个百分点降至6月的4个百分点。

民调显示，41%的注册选民相信特朗普的经济政策，而37%的人相信拜登。尽管自2月以来，拜登取得了进步，但他的整体地位仍然受到挑战，因为他在经济管理方面的批准评分一直很低。这很重要，因为**选民将经济作为他们11月选举的首要问题**。

该调查还强调了受访者对住房和食品成本上涨的担忧，约80%的参与者将通货膨胀列为财务压力的主要来源。联邦储备计划通过维持高借贷利率来控制价格。

在降低医疗保健成本（包括药物价格和保险费）方面，拜登似乎在老年选民中比特朗普更受信任。然而，年轻人仍然以10个百分点的优势青睐特朗普。

距离选举日还有五个月，两位候选人继续加紧攻击，为即将到来的亚特兰大电视辩论做准备。民调结果表明，**经济仍然是选民的首要关切**，可能会对2024年美国总统选举的结果产生关键影响。

 **Summary of FT-Michigan Ross Poll on Joe Biden and Donald Trump's Economic Handling**

A recent poll conducted by the Financial Times and the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business reveals a shift in voter sentiment regarding which candidate they trust more to handle the US economy. The survey, carried out from May 30 to June 3, shows that **Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden** has decreased from 11 points in February to just four points in June.

The poll indicates that 41% of registered voters trust Trump on the economy, while 37% place their confidence in Biden. Despite this improvement for Biden since February, his overall standing remains challenged due to persistently low approval ratings on economic management. This is significant as **voters cite the economy as their top issue** heading into November's election.

The survey also highlights concerns about rising costs of housing and food among respondents, with inflation being a major source of financial stress for approximately 80% of participants. The Federal Reserve plans to maintain high borrowing rates in an effort to control prices.

Biden appears to have an advantage over Trump when it comes to older voters' trust on economic stewardship and lowering healthcare costs, including drug prices and insurance premiums. However, younger adults still favor Trump by a 10-point margin.

With five months left before the election day, both candidates continue to sharpen their attacks as they prepare for an upcoming live televised debate in Atlanta, Georgia. The poll results suggest that **the economy remains voters' primary concern** and could play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election.
