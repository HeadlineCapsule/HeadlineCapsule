亚马逊改变计划，推迟订购英伟达“超级芯片”以等待更新型号。

# **亚马逊推迟英伟达超级芯片订单，引发 AI 芯片市场需求担忧**

*关键要点：*
- **全球最大的云计算提供商亚马逊网络服务（AWS）** 推迟了使用**英伟达的格蕾丝·霍珀（Grace Hopper）超级芯片**的计划。
- AWS 表示，由于两款产品发布时间接近，他们将等待性能更强大的**格蕾丝·布莱克威尔（Grace Blackwell）**芯片，而不是选择霍珀芯片。
- 这一推迟引发了投资者对 AI 芯片需求可能下降的担忧，一些人预期在大科技公司去年疯狂支出用于 AI 技术后会出现“空气袋”现象。
- 尽管英伟达预计其销售额将因科技巨头在人工智能方面的投资而保持强劲增长，但人们对其增长势头的持续性提出了质疑。
- 新的布莱克威尔芯片预计将于 2024 年第四季度交付，预测价格为每台服务器高达 300 万美元。

**问答:**

1. **亚马逊为何推迟订购英伟达格蕾丝·霍珀超级芯片?**
   - 亚马逊网络服务（AWS）决定推迟使用格蕾丝·霍珀超算芯片的计划，因为其继任者格蕾丝·布莱克威尔芯片即将发布。该公司表示，考虑到两款产品生命周期之间的时间间隔很短，等待性能更强大的选项是合理的。

2. **这一推迟对英伟达和 AI 芯片市场有何影响?**
   - 这一推迟引发了投资者的担忧，他们担心人工智能芯片的需求可能下降，尤其是在大科技公司去年疯狂支出用于该技术之后。尽管预计英伟达将因科技巨头在人工智能方面的投资而实现强劲销售，但 AWS（其最大的客户之一）的这一举动可能会表明推迟购买的更广泛趋势，因为各公司都在等待布莱克威尔芯片的发布。

3. **市场对这一消息有何反应?**
   - 自 2024 年年初以来，英伟达 H100 芯片（基于霍珀架构）的长期等待时间明显缩短。供应状况的改善可能导致英伟达股价较今年早些时候投资者信心高峰时相比涨幅较小但更为稳定。

4. **分析师对英伟达未来芯片的需求和供应有何预测?**
   - 摩根士丹利的分析师表示，即使上一代芯片的可用性增加，新的云、企业和主权客户也将迅速吸收这些库存。他们预计在布莱克威尔芯片于2024 年第四季度发布前的这段时间里，对英伟达产品的需求仍将强

**Amazon Delays Nvidia Superchip Order, Sparking Demand Concerns in AI Chip Market:** 

*Key Points:*
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, the world's largest cloud computing provider, has delayed plans to use **Nvidia's Grace Hopper superchip**. 
- AWS will instead wait for the more powerful **Grace Blackwell** chip, citing a small window between the two product cycles.
- The delay has sparked concerns among investors about a potential dip in demand for AI chips, with some anticipating an "air pocket" following last year's frenzied spending by Big Tech on AI technology. 
- While Nvidia expects strong sales driven by AI investments from tech giants, questions arise regarding the sustainability of its growth streak.
- The new Blackwell chip is expected to be delivered in Q4 2024 with a predicted price of up to $3 million per server. 

**Questions and Answers:**

1. **Why has Amazon delayed its order of Nvidia's Grace Hopper superchip?**
   - Amazon Web Services (AWS) decided to delay their plans for using the Grace Hopper superchip because of the imminent release of its successor, the Grace Blackwell chip. The company stated that the short time gap between the two product cycles made it sensible to wait for the more powerful option. 

2. **What impact does this delay have on Nvidia and the AI chip market?**
   - This delay has caused a stir among investors who are now concerned about a potential dip in demand for AI chips, especially after the frenzied spending by Big Tech companies last year. While Nvidia is expected to report strong sales driven by AI investments from tech giants, this move by AWS, one of its largest customers, could indicate a broader trend of delayed purchases as companies await the Blackwell chip's release. 

3. **How has the market reacted to this news?**
   - Since the beginning of 2024, there has been a noticeable easing of the long wait times for Nvidia's H100 chips (part of the Hopper architecture). This improved supply situation may have contributed to a more stable but less dramatic increase in Nvidia's stock price compared to earlier in the year when investor confidence was at its peak. 

4. **What are analysts' predictions for the demand and supply of Nvidia's chips going forward?**
   - Analysts from Morgan Stanley express confidence that even if there is increased availability of last-generation chips, new cloud, enterprise, and sovereign customers will quickly absorb this supply. They anticipate a continued strong demand for Nvidia's products during this interim period before the Blackwell chip's release in Q4 2024. 

5. **What are the key features and potential applications of the Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell chips?**
   - The Grace Hopper superchip (GH200) is a powerful package that combines multiple sought-after H100 graphics processing units with high-speed memory, connectivity, and a central processing unit. Its successor, the GB200 (based on the Blackwell architecture), promises even greater performance, particularly in training large language models like those used by OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

6. **What are the potential implications for Amazon and other tech companies investing in AI?**
   - The delay by AWS could indicate a strategic decision to invest in the more advanced technology offered by the Grace Blackwell chip. This may impact the timing of their AI initiatives, but it also demonstrates a commitment to staying at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field. Other tech companies may follow suit, causing a temporary pause in purchases as they await the latest and greatest chip technology from Nvidia. 

7. **How has Nvidia managed supply and demand between product upgrades in the past?**
   - Nvidia has faced challenges in smoothly managing supply and demand during previous product transitions. For example, surges in demand for chips suitable for video games and cryptocurrency mining during the Covid-19 pandemic were followed by a glut of GPUs as consumers
