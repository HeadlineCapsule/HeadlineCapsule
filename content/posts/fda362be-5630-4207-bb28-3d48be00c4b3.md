# 墨西哥考虑向银行征税以增加财政收入 

**克劳迪娅·辛鲍姆（Claudia Sheinbaum）领导的墨**西哥**即将上任的政府* *正在考虑从该国利润丰厚的银行业获取更多税收收入的方法。此举旨在解决预计2023年不断增长的财政赤字问题，并使公共财政走上更可持续的道路。官员们正在讨论各行业的各种措施，包括限制税收抵扣和对**银行意外利得征税**，这些银行主要是由 BBVA 和桑坦德等大型西班牙和美国贷款机构主导的。随着高利率提升了回报，墨西哥银行业创下了利润新纪录。尽管法律改革可能具有挑战性，但政府可以在没有它们的情况下限制某些税收抵扣；一个例子是限制抵消缴纳存款保险计划的能力来抵税。1994 年金融危机后建立现行监管框架，其优先考虑的是强大的资本化，但也导致了关于鼓励放贷和竞争的辩论。任何增加征税都可能影响银行利润和股价，BBVA 对 Banco Sabadell 的出价就是一个例子。由于墨西哥寻求提高与其经合组织国家同行相比较低的税收收入，银行业被视为关键目标，围绕潜在改革产生了大量“噪音”，这些改革可能会为政府提供新的可观收入来源"。

# Mexico Eyes Tax Squeeze on Banks to Raise Revenue 

**Mexico's incoming administration, led by presidential frontrunner Claudia Sheinbaum**, is considering **options to increase tax revenue from the country's lucrative banking sector**. The move aims to address the **growing fiscal deficit** projected for 2023 and put public finances on a more sustainable path. Officials are discussing various measures across sectors, including restricting tax deductions and imposing windfall taxes on profits for banks, which are dominated by large Spanish and US lenders like BBVA and Santander. Mexico's banking sector has delivered record profits, with higher interest rates boosting returns. While legal changes may be challenging, the government could limit certain tax deductions without them; one example is limiting the ability to offset contributions to the deposit insurance scheme against tax. The existing regulatory framework, established post-1994 financial crisis, prioritizes strong capitalization but has led to debate over lending and competition encouragement. Any increases in taxation may impact banks' profits and share prices, as seen with BBVA's bid for Banco Sabadell. As Mexico seeks to increase its low tax revenue relative to OECD countries, the banking sector is viewed as a key target, creating "noise" around potential changes that could provide substantial new income streams for the government.
