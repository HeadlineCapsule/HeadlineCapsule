特朗普的禁言令在总统辩论前几天部分解除

# 摘要：

在 2024 年总统选举第一场总统辩论举行前几天，纽约法官胡安·默钱（Juan Merchan）部分解除对唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的前总统的禁言令。这一决定允许特朗普讨论他最近“封口费”审判中的证人和陪审员，但有关检察官（除地区检察官阿尔文·布拉格 [Alvin Bragg] 之外）的言论和针对默钱法官家人攻击的限制仍然存在。

# 要点：

- 禁言令是在特朗普因“封口费”审判被判犯有 34 项刑事罪名时实施的。
- 司法官胡安·默钱（Juan Merchan）解除了一些限制，理由是情况发生了变化，允许特朗普讨论证人和陪审员。
- 由于担心对陪审员的潜在威胁，有关披露陪审员身份信息的限制仍然存在。
- 在特朗普准备与美国总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）进行 2024 年第一次总统辩论之际，这一决定出台。
- 特朗普在竞选期间面临法律麻烦，违反了禁言令，导致被指控藐视法庭。
- 律师认为禁言令违宪，妨碍了有效的竞选活动。

# 附加信息：

特朗普仍然受到另一联邦案件的禁言令限制，该案件涉及他涉嫌试图阻挠 2020 年选举后和平权力移交；他还反对特别顾问杰克·史密斯（Jack Smith）要求对机密文件实施的单独禁言令。

 **Article Summary:**  

The gag order on former President Donald Trump has been partially lifted by New York Judge Juan Merchan just days before the first presidential debate in the 2024 election. This decision allows Trump to discuss witnesses and jurors from his recent "hush money" trial, but restrictions remain regarding statements about prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg and attacks on members of Judge Merchan's family.

**Key Points:**  
- The gag order was imposed during Trump's conviction for 34 criminal counts in the "hush money" trial.
- Justice Juan Merchan lifted some restrictions, citing changed circumstances and allowing Trump to discuss witnesses and jurors.
- Restrictions on disclosing identifying details about jurors remain due to concerns of potential threats against them.
- The decision comes as Trump prepares for the first presidential debate with US President Joe Biden in 2024.
- Trump has faced legal troubles and violated gag orders during his campaign, leading to contempt charges.
- Lawyers argue that the gag order is unconstitutional and hampers effective campaigning.

**Additional Information:**  

Trump remains subject to a partial gag order in another federal case related to alleged attempts to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after his 2020 election loss, as well as fighting against a separate gag order requested by special counsel Jack Smith over classified documents.
