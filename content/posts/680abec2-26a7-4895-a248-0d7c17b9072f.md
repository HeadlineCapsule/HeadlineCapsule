杠杆贷款违约激增，英国央行警告私募股权的“挑战”

# 英格兰银行对私募股权部门的挑战和潜在风险表示担忧

**摘要：**
英格兰银行（BoE）对高杠杆贷款违约上升和私募股权行业面临的挑战表示关切，这可能对英国经济产生影响。在私募股权支持的高风险借款人中，违约率飙升了250%，其中很大一部分贷款流向了由此类实体拥有的公司。英格兰银行的《金融稳定报告》强调，英国私营部门约有**10%**的工人受雇于私募股权支持的企业，总人数约为200万。

全球银行体系对私募股权活动有相当多的敞口，如果风险成为现实，可能会导致银行信贷损失。英格兰银行敦促贷款人提高与估值和杠杆水平相关的透明度和风险管理实践。随着英国于7月4日 yaklaş一次大选，工党把私募股权行业作为目标，提议增加对从资产销售中获得的收益所收取的携带利益费的税收。

报告还指出，更高的利率、缓慢的交易和IPO市场使私募股权基金很难出售或上市公司。这种情况导致公司采用净资产价值融资和股息再投资等非常规方法，从而增加对基础资产的杠杆。英格兰银行承认私募股权在为英国公司提供资金方面发挥着重要作用，但警告说，高杠杆、估值不透明、风险管理实践可变以及与高风险信贷市场的紧密联系可能会给银行和机构投资者带来损失。

**要点：**
- 由于私募股权行业面临挑战，高杠杆贷款违约率飙升了250%。
- 英格兰银行担心私募股权领域的风险可能产生溢出效应，该行业雇佣了英国私营部门约**10%**（~200万）的工人。
- 全球银行体系对私募股权活动有重大敞口，如果风险成为现实，可能会面临信贷损失。
- 英格兰银行敦促贷款人提高与估值和杠杆水平相关的透明度和风险管理实践。
- 在即将到来的大选中，工党提议增加对携带利益费的税收。
- 私募股权基金因利率上升、交易缓慢和IPO市场而面临挑战；公司采用净资产价值融资和股息再投资等非常规方法。

 **Article Summary:**  
The Bank of England (BoE) has expressed concerns over the rising defaults on leveraged loans and challenges faced by the private equity sector, which could potentially impact the UK economy. Defaults have surged 250% for risky borrowers backed by private equity, with a significant portion of these loans being extended to companies owned by such entities. The BoE's Financial Stability Report highlights that about **10%** of workers in the UK'n private sector are employed by private equity-backed firms, totaling around 2 million people.

The global banking system has substantial exposure to private equity activities, which could lead to credit losses for banks if risks materialize. The BoE is urging lenders to improve transparency and risk management practices related to valuation and leverage levels. As the UK approaches a general election on July 4, the Labour party has targeted the private equity industry by proposing increased taxes on carried interest fees received from asset sales.

The report also notes that higher interest rates, slow dealmaking, and IPO markets have made it challenging for private equity funds to sell or list companies. This situation has led firms to adopt unconventional approaches like net asset value financing and dividend recapitalizations, adding more leverage to underlying assets. The BoE acknowledges the significant role of private equity in providing funding to UK companies but warns that vulnerabilities from high leverage, opacity around valuations, variable risk management practices, and strong interconnections with risky credit markets could generate losses for banks and institutional investors.

**Key Points:**  
- Defaults on leveraged loans have surged 250% due to challenges faced by the private equity sector.
- The BoE is concerned about potential spillover effects of risks in private equity, which employs around 10% (~2 million) workers in the UK's private sector.
- Global banking system has significant exposure to private equity activities and could face credit losses if risks materialize.
- The BoE urges lenders to improve transparency and risk management practices related to valuation and leverage levels.
- Labour party proposes increased taxes on carried interest fees received from asset sales in the upcoming general election.
- Private equity funds face challenges due to higher interest rates, slow dealmaking, and IPO markets; firms adopt unconventamo approaches like net asset value financing and dividend recapitalizations.
