南非考虑组建全国统一政府

# 非洲国民大会党考虑与对手政党组建全国统一政府

**摘要：**
在非洲国民大会党（ANC）在上周的震惊选举结果中失去其30年的议会多数席位后，该党正在考虑与南非对手政党组建全国统一政府。 ANC一直在讨论各种选项，包括大联合政府和特定联盟，以组建下一届政府。然而，由于意识形态和原则的不同，并非所有政党都愿意加入这样的统一政府。

**要点：**
- 在上周的选举中失去议会多数席位后，南非非洲国民大会党（ANC）正在探索与对手政党组建全国统一政府的可能性。
- ANC一直处于谈判之中，以确定如何最好地组建下一届政府，同时考虑各种选项，例如大联合政府和特定联盟。
- 全国统一政府并不是南非的新概念; 它之前在纳尔逊·曼德拉（Nelson Mandela）1994年的第一届政府中得到过实施。
- 民主联盟（DA），以21.8%的选票成为第二大政党，已表示对加入某些不尊重宪法的政党的联盟持保留态度。
- 祖马的uMkhonto weSizwe（MK）和经济自由战士（EFF）是正在考虑纳入统一政府的政党之一; 然而，ANC内部的一些派系对其意识形态表达了担忧。
- 市场对所有政党都参与的大联合政府的可能性做出了负面反应，投资者担心这可能导致不稳定和不确定性。
- Zizi Kodwa因腐败指控而被捕，为ANC组建下一届政府增加了另一层复杂性。

 **Summary:**  
The African National Congress (ANC) is considering the formation of a national unity government with rival parties in South Africa after losing its 30-year parliamentary majority in last week's shock election result. The ANC has been discussing various options, including grand coalitions and specific alliances, to form the next government. However, not all parties are open to joining such a unity government due to differences in ideologies and principles.

**Key Points:**  
- South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) is exploring the possibility of forming a national unity government with rival parties after losing its 30-year parliamentary majority in last week's election.
- The ANC has been locked in talks to determine how best to form the next government, considering various options such as grand coalitions and specific alliances.
- A national unity government is not a new concept for South Africa; it was previously implemented during Nelson Mandela's first government in 1994.
- The Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party with 21.8% of the vote, has expressed reservations about joining a coalition with certain parties that do not respect the constitution.
- Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are among the parties being considered for inclusion in the unity government; however, some factions within the ANC have expressed concerns about their ideologies.
- The market reacted negatively to the prospect of a grand coalition involving all parties, with investors worried that it could lead to instability and uncertainty.
- Zizi Kodwa's recent arrest on corruption charges adds another layer of complexity for the ANC as they navigate forming the next government.
