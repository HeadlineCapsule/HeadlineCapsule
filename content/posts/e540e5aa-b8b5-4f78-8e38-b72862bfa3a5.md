以色列预计对哈马斯的加沙战争将持续7个月。

# 以色列预计其对加沙的哈马斯军事行动将持续七个月

**摘要：**
文章讨论了以色列的预期，即他们针对哈马斯的军事行动将持续七个月，旨在“摧毁”哈马斯在该地区的领导力量。国家安全顾问茨哈基·哈内格比重申了这一时间框架，并强调了以色列历史上的生存耐力。冲突已导致加沙内部大量伤亡和破坏，国际社会对以色列军队涉嫌战争罪行的批评不断增加。尽管面临压力，总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡坚持表示，在取得成就之前，他不会结束这场战争。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：以色列预计其针对加沙哈马斯的军事行动将持续七个月是基于哪些因素？
答案：文章提出了一些贡献因素，包括原始的战争计划将2024年定义为战斗年，以及以色列军队目前取得的进展。此外，国际社会施压以结束冲突也可能影响以色列决心在这一时间框架内实现其“摧毁”哈马斯统治加沙的目标。

2. 问题：持续的军事行动如何影响了加沙的人道主义局势和民用人口？
答案：文章强调，冲突已导致大量伤亡，根据哈马斯控制领土的卫生当局的数据，已有超过36000人死亡。此外，加沙大片地区已变成废墟，大部分人口流离失所，导致国际人道主义灾难，援助团体也如此报告。

3. 问题：如果以色列继续对加沙的哈马斯发动军事行动，尽管面临不断增加的国际批评，可能会有什么潜在后果？
答案：文章提到，以色列军队面临来自国际法院和国际刑事法院的战争罪指控，这可能导致进一步的审查和谴责。继续冲突也可能导致以色列在国际舞台上越来越被孤立，影响与其他国家和组织的外交关系。

**Summary:**  
The article discusses Israel's expectation that their military campaign against Hamas in Gaza will continue for seven more months, aiming to "destroy" Hamas as a leading power in the region. National security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi reiterates this timeframe and emphasizes patience and resilience based on historical survival of Israel. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties and destruction within Gaza, with international criticism mounting over alleged war crimes by Israeli forces. Despite the pressure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists that he will not end the war until achebts are achieved.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. Q: What factors contribute to Israel's expectation of a seven-month duration for their military campaign against Hamas in Gaza?  
A: The article suggests several contributing factors, including the original war plan that defined 2024 as a year of combat and the current progress made by Israeli forces. Additionally, international pressure to end the conflict may influence Israel's determination to achieve its goal of "destroying" Hamas's rule in Gaza within this timeframe.

2. Q: How has the ongoing military campaign impacted the humanitarian situation and civilian population in Gaza?  
A: The article highlights that the conflict has led to a significant number of casualties, with over 36,000 people killed according to health authorities in Hamas-controlled territory. Additionally, vast swathes of Gaza have been reduced to rubble and much of its population displaced, leading to an international humanitarian catastrophe as reported by aid groups.

3. Q: What are the potential consequences for Israel if they continue their military campaign against Hamas in Gaza despite mounting international criticism?  
A: The article mentions that Israeli forces have faced allegations of war crimes from both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, which could lead to further scrutiny and condemnation. Continuing the conflict may also result in increased isolation for Israel on the international stage, potentially impacting diplomatic relations with other countries and organizations.
