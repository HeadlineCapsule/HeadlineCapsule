# **Isa 季度** 资金流入额增加四倍

在 2023-24 年度的 **Isa 季度**，英国投资者对股市的投资热情高涨，与去年相比有显著增加。从 2 月 15 日起至 4 月 5 日，流入股市的净金额达 **19.3亿英镑**，较去年同期上升四倍，也是十年来最高水平。这反映出全球股市蓬勃发展的势头，诸如 **标准普尔 500 指数**、**道琼斯工业平均指数** 和 **达克斯指数** 等股指都取得了显著收益。这一趋势也体现在资金流出 **货币市场基金**，因为投资者寻求更高的收益。 

尽管 **富时 100 指数** 表现强劲，但英国投资者在 4 月从专注于英国的股基金中撤回了 **6.65 亿英镑**，这是连续第 35 个月出现资金流出。然而，2023 年第一季度的整体情况呈现出积极趋势，股本基金净投资额接近 **70 亿英镑**。英国政府正努力推动对伦敦上市公司的投资，推出了拟议中的 **"British Isa"** 等倡议，旨在解决国内外股本投资持续存在的差异。 

第一季度和 4 月，固定收益基金也保持吸引力，投资总额分别达到 **12 亿英镑** 和 **4.22 亿英镑**。同时，新兴市场基金出现净流出，结束了连续 18 个月的净投资，投资者卖出了 **1.62 亿英镑** 的资产。

# Isa season flows rise fivefold

During the 2023-24 **Isa season**, UK investors displayed a strong appetite for equities, with a significant increase in investments compared to the previous year. Between February 15 and April 5, a net amount of **£1.93 billion** flowed into equity funds, a fivefold rise year-on-year and the highest level in a decade. This shift towards **riskier assets** reflects the bullish sentiment in global stock markets, with indices such as the **S&P 500**, **Dow Jones**, and **DAX** posting notable gains. The trend was also evident in the outflow from **money market funds**, as investors sought higher returns. 

/n/n

Despite the strong performance of the **FTSE 100**, UK investors withdrew **£665 million** from UK equity-focused funds in April, marking the 35th consecutive month of outflows. However, the overall picture for the first quarter of 2023 showed a positive trend, with nearly **£7 billion** invested in equity funds on a net basis. The UK government's efforts to boost investment in London-listed companies, through initiatives like the proposed **"British Isa"**, aim to address this ongoing divergence between domestic and overseas equity investments. 

/n/n

Fixed income funds also remained attractive, with continued investments in the first quarter and April, totaling **£1.2 billion** and **£422 million**, respectively. Meanwhile, **emerging markets funds** experienced net outflows, breaking an 18-month streak of net investment as investors sold **£162 million** in holdings.
