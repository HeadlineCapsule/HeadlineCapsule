沃伦·巴菲特去世时将把巨额财富留给新基金会

# 沃伦·巴菲特的财富转移

亿万富翁投资者沃伦·巴菲特计划在去世时将其估计为 1300 亿美元的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司股票巨额财富遗赠给一个由他的三个孩子领导的新基金会。这标志着近二十年的向比尔和梅琳达盖茨基金会捐款的结束，并标志着巴菲特遗产规划中一个重要的慈善转变。

# 由孩子们领导的新的基金会

巴菲特确认，苏西、霍华德和彼得·巴菲特将担任这个新基金会的受托人，该基金会将在巴菲特去世后获得历史上最大的财富注入之一。盖茨基金会将不再从巴菲特的遗产中受益。

# 与盖茨基金会的历史渊源

巴菲特与盖茨基金会有着长期的关系，可以追溯到 2006 年他宣布年度捐款，并于 2010 年共同创立了捐赠誓言。他的贡献结构化为每年直到去世为止的伯克希尔股份的 5% 的持续承诺。

# 对慈善事业的影响

巴菲特的新的基金会成立时，将与诺和诺德斯克基金会相媲美，并超过盖茨基金会和福特基金会等其他大型慈善机构，成为全球最大的捐赠机构之一。这使它能够每年为各种全球性问题提供数亿美元的项目资金，例如医疗保健、农业发展和性别平等倡议。

# 孩子们基金会的慈善重点

巴菲特没有为他的孩子指定任何特定的慈善事业，但强调新基金会的目的应该是帮助不幸的人，并承认他和他的家人比世界其他人口享有更多的特权。

 **Warren Buffett's Wealth Transfer**  

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett plans to bequeath his vast wealth, estimated at $130 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock, to a new foundation led by his three children upon his death. This marks the end of nearly two decades of donations to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and establishes a significant philanthropic shift for Buffett's estate planning.

**New Foundation Led by Children**  

Buffett confirmed that Susie, Howard, and Peter Buffet would serve as trustees of this new foundation, which is set to receive one of the largest wealth infusions in history upon his passing. The Gates Foundation will no longer benefit from Buffett's estate after his death.

**Historical Ties with Gates Foundation**  

Buffett has had a long-standing relationship with the Gates Foundation, dating back to 2006 when he announced annual donations and later co-founded the Giving Pledge in 2010. His contributions were structured as an ongoing commitment of 5% of his Berkshire shares each year until his death.

**Impact on Philanthropy Landscape**  

Upon its launch, Buffett's new foundation will rival the Novo Nordisk Foundation and surpass other large charities like the Gates and Ford foundations in terms of endowment size. This positions it to fund billions of dollars worth of projects annually across various global issues such as healthcare, agriculture development, and gender equity initiatives.

**Philanthropic Focus for Children's Foundation**  

Buffett has not specified any particular philanthropies for his children to pursue with the new foundation. However, he emphasized that its purpose should be to help those less fortunate and acknowledged the immense privilege enjoyed by himself and his family compared to the rest of the world's population.
