# 英国议员推动在英格兰和威尔士取消堕胎罪

英国越来越多的**议员**和**女性权益倡议者**推动在英格兰和威尔士**取消堕胎罪**，并对根据一项**19 世纪法律**对女性进行调查的“激增”表示担忧。 医生和学者敦促更新**1861 年法律**，该法律仍将未经医疗授权的堕胎视为非法，使女性面临可能的监禁。 预计将于下周对**刑事司法法案**的**修正**进行表决，至少有一项修正将允许在不受政党影响的情况下进行**自由投票**。 拟议的修改旨在保护女性免遭起诉，同时仍保留**24 周的时间限制**并要求**医疗批准**。 根据民意调查，这一举措得到了大多数议员和公众的支持，被认为是保护女性权益和健康的必要步骤。 然而，反对者认为，取消堕胎罪可能会导致出于任何原因（包括**选择胎儿性别**）的堕胎增加。 政府承认这个问题很敏感，并表示任何改变都将取决于个别议员的个人判断。

# MPs in push to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales

There is a growing push from **MPs** and **women's rights campaigners** to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, with concerns over a "surge" in investigations of women under a **19th-century law**. Doctors and academics are urging an update to the **1861 law**, which still classifies abortion as illegal without medical authorization, leaving women vulnerable to potential jail sentences. **Amendments** to the **criminal justice bill** are expected to be voted on next week, with at least one amendment allowing a **free vote** without party influence. The proposed changes aim to protect women from prosecution, while still maintaining the **24-week time limit** and requiring **medical approval**. This move is supported by a majority of MPs and the public, according to polls, and is seen as a necessary step to protect women's rights and health. Opponents, however, argue that decriminalization could lead to an increase in abortions for any reason, including **sex-selective purposes**. The government has acknowledged the sensitivity of the issue and stated that any changes would be left to the conscience of individual MPs.
