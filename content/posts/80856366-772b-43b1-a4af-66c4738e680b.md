测量您的绿色投资组合的温度

**摘要：**
文章讨论了衡量公司碳足迹的挑战性任务及其对投资者维持与全球变暖目标一致的可持续投资组合的影响，尤其是防止平均温度升高超过 1.5 摄氏度。文章强调了 MSCI 的“隐含温度升高”方法被许多投资者用作工具，但同时也批评了该方法缺乏科学严谨性并依赖于可疑的数据。

文章还指出了这种方法的缺陷，例如计算过程中的假设、各国排放披露要求的不一致以及基于收入的碳预算权重的逆向结果。作者提出，如果意味着错过与公司接触以推动积极变化或投资于积极推动提高目标的基金管理人的机会，那么更冷的投资组合可能并不总是更好的选择。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题："隐含温度升高"的方法是如何运作的，它的局限性又是什么？
   答案：隐含温度升高是一种根据公司收入分配碳预算并确定每个公司在防止全球温度上升超过 1.5 摄氏度方面的剩余预算的方法。然而，由于计算过程中所做的假设和各国排放披露要求的不一致，该方法存在局限性。此外，基于收入的碳预算权重可能导致逆向结果，准确反映了公司对全球变暖目标的实际影响。

2. 问题：使用诸如“隐含温度升高”等不精确科学的方法对旨在维持可持续投资组合的投资者有何潜在后果？
   答案：使用诸如隐含温度升高等不精确的方法可能会导致投资者根据不完整或误导性信息做出决定。这可能会错过与公司接触并鼓励他们设定更好目标的机会，从而可能导致整体上更不可持续的投资组合。此外，仅仅依靠这种方法可能会导致投资者忽视评估其投资环境影响时其他重要因素。

3. 问题：投资者如何在准确测量和问责制与当前碳足迹计算方法的局限性之间取得平衡？
   答案：投资者应考虑使用多种工具和方法的组合，例如隐含温度升高与其他指标的结合，如排放披露、接触记录和股东大会上的投票模式。这种多方面的做法可以更全面地了解其投资的环境影响，同时承认任何单一测量方法的局限性。此外，随时了解碳足迹计算方法的进步并倡导改进的排放披露标准可能会随着时间的推移帮助提高准确性和问责制。

**Summary:**
The article discusses the challenging task of measuring a company's carbon footprint and its implications for investors aiming to maintain sustainable portfolebiolines aligned with global warming targets, particularly preventing an average temperature rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius. The "implied temperature rise" methodology by MSCI is highlighted as a tool used by many investors but criticized for its lack of scientific rigor and reliance on dubious data.

The article also points out the flaws in this approach, such as assumptions made during calculations, inconsistent emissions disclosure requirements across countries, and counterintuitive results due to revenue-based carbon budget weighting. The author suggests that a cooler portfolio may not always be better if it means missing out on engaging with companies for positive change or investing in fund managers who actively push for improved targets.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: How does the "implied temperature rise" methodology work, and what are its limitations?
   A: The implied temperature rise is a calculation that allocates carbon budgets to public companies based on their revenues. It then determines how much of this budget remains for each company in relation to preventing global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsieus. However, the methodology has limitations due to assumptions made during calculations and inconsistent emissions disclosure requirements across countries. Additionally, revenue-based carbon budget weighting can lead to counterintuitive results that may not accurately reflect a company's actual impact on global warming targets.
   
2. Q: What are the potential consequences of using an inexact science like "implied temperature rise" for investors aiming to maintain sustainable portfolios?
   A: Using an imprecise methodology such as implied temperature rise may lead investors to make decisions based on incomplete or misleading information. This could result in missed opportunities for engaging with companies and encouraging them to set better targets, potentially leading to a less sustainable portfolio overall. Furthermore, relying solely on this methodology might cause investors to overlook other important factors when assessing the environmental impact of their investments.
   
3. Q: How can investors balance the need for accurate measurements and accountability with the limitations of current carbon footprint calculation methods?
   A: Investors should consider using a combination of tools and approaches, such as implied temperature rise alongside other metrics like emissions disclosures, engagement records, and voting patterns at shareholder meetings. This multi-faceted approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of their investments while acknowledging the limitations of any single measurement methodology. Additionally, staying informed about advancements in carbon footprint calculation methods and advocating for improved emissions disclosure standards may help enhance accuracy and accountability over time.
