# FirstFT: Vladimir Putin replaces defence minister in unexpected shake-up

**Russian President Vladimir Putin** has replaced his **defence minister**, **Sergei Shoigu**, in a surprising move that indicates his dissatisfaction with the handling of the war in Ukraine. Shoigu, who has been moved to head Russia's security council, was once seen as a powerful figure due to his closeness to Putin. His replacement, **Andrei Belousov**, is a deputy prime minister and longtime economic adviser to Putin with no military background. This shake-up is the biggest change to Putin's security team in 15 years. 

The newsletter also covers other global news, including the **UK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's** promise of "bold ideas" ahead of elections, the **US shale oil industry** facing lawsuits over collusion claims, and the **owner of Pret A Manger** pivoting to insurance. Additionally, it mentions **Israel's battle** with Hamas, the **economic gap between Europe and the US**, and the **increase in life expectancy** in the UK since the industrial revolution.
