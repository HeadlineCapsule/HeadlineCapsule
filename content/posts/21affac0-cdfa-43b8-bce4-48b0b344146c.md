淡马锡为提高新加坡回报而寻找交易机会

# 新加坡政府投资公司（GIC）的战略：

国家投资公司淡马锡敦促当地企业更加全球化，并通过收购来增长，以此提高其 3820 亿新元投资组合的回报。该基金一直是在幕后支持它持有股份的公司（如星展银行、新加坡科技工程公司、新加坡航空和新加坡航运公司）的主要合并和收购的“幕后推手”。

# 交易活动管道：

在淡马锡的鼓励下，预计很快将宣布更多交易，这将为政府的国家预算收入做出重大贡献。这些交易旨在推动其投资组合公司在新加坡和全球的增长前景。

# 淡马锡与 GIC 的比较：

虽然淡马锡专注于在各种市场上进行公共和私人投资，其投资组合中有 54% 由新加坡公司组成，但 GIC 是新加坡的主权财富基金，负责在新加坡以外地区投资并管理国家外汇储备。

# 活跃投资者的角色：

淡马锡一直与其投资组合公司积极接触，鼓励合并和收购，以改善他们的增长前景，而不必强迫他们进行此类交易。这种方法被视为在新加坡即将举行大选之际，努力提高该基金的业绩。

# 最近的交易亮点：

最近一些涉及淡马锡支持的公司交易包括星展银行领导对 ST Telemedia Global Data Centres 的 17.5 亿美元投资以及塔塔集团旗下的印度航空公司与维斯塔拉航空公司（新加坡航空公司的合资企业）的合并。

# 淡马锡的回报：

在全球经济不确定性的背景下，淡马锡面临着政府提高其回报的压力。该基金报告了 2023 年 3 月底结束的一年内股东回报下降 5.07%，这是近年来最差的年度业绩之一。然而，它更倾向于关注长期增长，2023 年报告了三年和十年期分别上涨 7.7% 和 6% 的业绩。

# 结论：

在全球经济挑战之际，淡马锡积极追求合并和收购，以此作为提高投资组合回报的战略的一部分，同时也支持其持有股份的新加坡公司的增长前景。

 **Temasek's Strategy**: State-owned investment company Temasek is urging local companies to become more global and grow through acquiscuations as a means of boosting returns from its S$382 billion portfolio. The fund has been an influential "behind the scenes" supporter of major mergers and acquisitions by companies it holds stakes in, such as Singtel, ST Engineering, Singapore Airlines, and Sembcorp Marine.

**Deal Activity Pipeline**: More deals encouraged by Temasek are expected to be announced soon, which will contribute significantly to the government's national budget revenue. These transactions aim to supercharge the growth prospects of its portfolio companies in Singapore and globally.

**Temasek vs GIC**: While Temasek focuses on investing both publicly and privately across various markets, with 54% of its portfolio comprising Singapore-based companies, GIC is the country's sovereign wealth fund that invests outside Singapore and manages national foreign reserves.

**Activist Investor Role**: Temasek has been engaging more actively with its portfolio companies to encourage mergers and acquisitions as a way of improving their growth prospects, without necessarily forcing them into such deals. This approach is seen as an effort to enhance the fund's bottom line ahead of a looming general election in Singapore.

**Recent Deal Highlights**: Some recent transactions involving Temasek-backed companies include Singtel leading a $1.75 billion investment in ST Telemedia Global Data Centres, and the merger between Tata-owned Air India and sister airline Vistara (a joint venture with Singapore Airlines).

**Temasek's Returns**: Temasek has faced pressure from the government to improve its returns amidst global economic uncertainty. The fund reported a 5.07% drop in shareholder returns for the year ending March 2023, marking one of its worst annual results in recent times. However, it prefers to focus on long-term growth, with a rise of 7.n7% over three years and 6% over ten years reported in 2023.

**Conclusion**: Temasek is actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions as part of its strategy to boost returns from its portfolio amidst global economic challenges, while also supporting the growth prospects of Singapore-based companies it holds stakes in.
