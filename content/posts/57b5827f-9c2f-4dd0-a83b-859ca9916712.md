# 日元干预的局限性 

**日本近期** 对外汇市场的**干预**（据称**日本财务省**花费 590 亿美元提振日元对美元汇率）已证明**成效短暂**，日元汇率已回落至原有水平。这一事件凸显了单边货币干预的**挑战**和**局限性**，特别是在**经济基本面**不利的情况下。**强势美元**受**较高美国利率**和通胀的推动，预计将持续对日元造成压力。尽管日本希望货币强势有**合理的经济和政治原因**，包括提升能源和食品进口的**购买力**和支持**家庭储蓄**，但在当前形势下，过于关注日元强势可能**有失偏颇**。日元**走弱**可能刺激**通胀**，对于**日本央行**来说是可取的，因为这有助于其实现通胀目标。单边货币干预（如日本近期 590 亿美元的支出所示）最终**无效**，任何短期影响都取决于具体目标和背景。鉴于日元作为“利差交易”的偏爱工具在全球市场上的独特地位，一次性的干预可能对交易员起到警示作用，但在此之外的进一步干预很可能徒劳无功且代价高昂。

# The limits of yen intervention 

**Japan's recent intervention** in the foreign exchange market, where the **Japanese Ministry of Finance** allegedly spent $59 billion to boost the value of the yen against the US dollar, has proven to be **short-lived**, with the currency sliding back to its previous level. This episode highlights the **challenges** and **limitations** of unilateral currency intervention, particularly when **economic fundamentals** are working against it. The **strong dollar** is driven by **higher US interest rates** and inflation, which are expected to persist, putting continued pressure on the yen. While Japan has valid **economic and political reasons** for wanting a stronger currency, including **boosting purchasing power** for energy and food imports and supporting **household savings**, the focus on the yen's strength may be **misguided** in the current context. A **weaker yen** could spur **inflation**, which is a **desirable outcome** for the **Bank of Japan** to achieve its inflation target. Unilateral currency intervention, as demonstrated by Japan's recent $59 billion expenditure, is ultimately **ineffective** in the long term, and any short-term impact is dependent on the specific objectives and context. Given the yen's unique position in the global market as a favored vehicle for the "carry trade," a one-time intervention could serve as a warning to traders, but further interventions beyond that are likely to be futile and costly.
