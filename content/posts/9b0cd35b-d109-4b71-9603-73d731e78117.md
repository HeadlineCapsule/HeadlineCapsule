我们大多数人持有太多债券。

## 摘要：
大多数投资者过多地投资于**债券**和固定收益等价物，这可能不利于长期增长。作者建议采用更平衡的方法，增加对股市的配置比例可能会带来更好的长期效果。关键概念包括传统的股票与债券 **60/40 分配比例**、**诺贝尔奖得主詹姆斯·托宾（James Tobin）的公式**，用于平滑捐赠基金的年度分配额，以及采取个性化的 "支出规则"，以创建可持续的退休收入流。

## 有趣的问题：
**Q1: 从传统的重债券投资组合转向重股本投资策略有哪些潜在风险？**
A1: 远离债券为主的投资组合所面临的主要风险是波动性增加。与债券相比，股票的价值波动往往更大，因此在市场下跌时可能导致短期内更大的损失。然而，从长远来看，股本通常能提供高于债券的回报，这可能会弥补这种风险。

**Q2: 詹姆斯·托宾（James Tobin）的公式如何有助于制定更有效的投资策略？** 
A2: 詹姆斯•托宾（James Tobin）的公式帮助捐赠基金等机构通过关注长期结果而不是资产和收入的短期波动来平滑年度分配额。这种方法为股本配置提供了更大的灵活性，随着时间的推移，这可能会带来更高的回报，同时减轻市场波动的影响。

**Q3: 个人投资者在确定自己的退休 "支出规则" 时应该考虑哪些因素？** 
A3：在制定个性化的支出规则时，个人投资者应考虑他们期望的退休生活方式、预期寿命以及维持购买力的需要。他们还应该考虑到可能影响他们在退休期间整体财务稳定性的任何其他收入或资产来源。一个明智的起点是 5% 的支出率，这可以保护资产价值，同时提供足够的收入流。

## Summary:
The article discusses how most investors have too much invested in **bonds** and fixed-income equivalents, which may not be optimal for long-term growth. The author suggests that a more balanced approach with higher allocations to equities could yield better results over extended periods. Key concepts include the historical 60/40 stock-to-bond ratio, **Nobel laureate James Tobin's formula** for smoothing distributions from endowments, and adopting a personalized "spending rule" to create sustainab

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What are the potential risks associated with shifting away from traditional bond-heavy portfolios towards equity-focused investment strategies?
A1: The primary risk of moving away from a bond-heavy portfolio is increased volatility. Equities tend to have higher fluctuations in value compared to bonds, which can lead to larger short-term losses during market downturns. However, over the long term, equities generally provide higher returns than bonds, potentially compensating for this risk.

Q2: How does James Tobin's formula contribute to a more effective investment strategy?
A2: James Tobin's formula helps institutions like endowments smooth out year-to-year distributions by focusing on long-term results rather than short-term fluctuations in asset and income. This approach allows for greater flexibility in allocating resources to equities, which can lead to higher returns over time while mitigating the impact of market volatility.

Q3: What factors should individual investors consider when determining their own "spending rule" for retirement?
A3: When establishing a personalized spending rule, individual investors should take into account their desired lifestyle in retirement, expected lifespan, and the need to maintain purchasing power. They should also factor in any other sources of income or assets that can contribute to their overall financial stability during retirement. A sensible starting point is a 5% spending rate, which allows for preserving asset value while providing an adequate income stream.
