# 普京访华之旅，或揭示美国的威胁只是空想

俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京即将在连任后首次出访中国，此次访问正值俄罗斯因**入侵乌克兰**而面临制裁之际，因此意义重大。普京的目标是加强与中国的经济关系，中国已成为俄罗斯**石油、天然气和军事供应**的重要市场。作者认为，尽管美国实施了制裁和威胁，但俄罗斯和中国表现出了韧性和适应能力，俄罗斯成功地实现了金融系统的**去美元化**。在交易中使用**人民币**以及开发**SPFS**和**CIPS**等替代支付系统，体现了两国规避制裁的能力。在普京和他的经济专家团队与中国同行会晤时，他们预计将制定战略，以进一步减轻制裁的影响，并建立一个“制裁免疫的基础设施”，其中可能涉及一些较小的银行和空壳公司。虽然这些机制可能只是临时解决方案，但它们凸显了俄罗斯和中国挑战美元霸权和美国制裁有效性的决心。

# Putin’s trip to China may show US threats are wishful thinking

Russian President Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to China is significant as it is his first foreign trip since his re-election and comes at a time when Russia faces sanctions due to the **Ukraine invasion**. Putin aims to strengthen the economic ties with China, which has become a crucial market for Russian **oil, gas, and military supplies**. The author argues that despite US sanctions and threats, Russia and China have demonstrated resilience and adaptability, with Russia successfully "de-dollarizing" its financial system. The use of the **Chinese renminbi** in transactions and the development of alternative payment systems, such as **SPFS** and **CIPS**, show the countries' ability to circumvent sanctions. As Putin and his team of economic experts meet with Chinese counterparts, they are expected to devise strategies to further minimize the impact of sanctions and create a "sanctions-proof infrastructure," potentially involving smaller banks and shell companies. While these mechanisms may only be temporary solutions, they highlight the determination of Russia and China to challenge the dominance of the US dollar and the effectiveness of US sanctions.
