估值之谜

作者对股票市场的估值提出了微妙的观点，尤其关注**循环调整后的市盈率** (**CAPE**)及其对投资者的影响。文本表明，虽然高 CAPE 比率历来表明市场高估，但可能有几个因素可以证明目前的估值是合理的：

1. 自二战以来，经济周期变得不那么波动，衰退的发生频率低于以前。这可能允许更高的股票估值，因为对投资者来说，主要风险之一（衰退）不太常见。
2. 市场组成已经转向增长更快的技术公司，这些公司通常由于其未来的增长潜力而拥有更高的市盈率，这可能导致整体更高的估值水平。
3. 随着技术进步和国内国际投资者参与度的提高，市场流动性得到改善，这可能会降低波动性并支持更高的估值。
4. 自 1940 年以来，每名工人的实际利润（利润生产率）一直在上升，与股票市场的市盈率密切相关。更高的盈利能力可能证明较高的估值水平是合理的，因为它反映了公司更强劲的增长前景。

作者对这些解释中关于流动性和基于生产力的理由的部分表示怀疑，尤其是在于高估值的理由。他们还警告不要过度依赖领先科技公司的高增长率的可持续性，因为历史表明市场地位可能会迅速改变。

总之，作者承认估值在投资决策中的重要性，但同时指出，目前股票市场的估值是否合理没有明确的共识或简单的答案。他们强调了预测未来增长率和经济周期的内在复杂性和不确定性，这些因素最终会影响资产价格，即预期现金流的现值。

The author presents a nuanced view on stock market valuations, particularly focusing on the CAPE ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings) and its implications for investors. The text suggests that while high CAPE ratios have historically indicated overvaluation in the market, there are several factors at play which may justify current valuations:

1. Economic cycles have become less volatile since WWII, with recessions occurring less frequently than before. This could allow for higher stock valuations as one of the primary risks to investors (recessions) is less common.
2. The market composition has shifted towards faster-growing technology companies that typically command higher PE multiples due to their future growth potential, which may contribute to overall higher valuation levels.
3. Market liquidity has improved with technological advancements and increased participation from both domestic and international investors, potentially reducing volatebility and supporting higher valuations.
4. Real profit per worker (profit productivity) has risen since 1940, which correlates closely with the stock market's PE multiple. Higher profitability could justify elevated valuation levels as it reflects stronger growth prospects for companies.

The author expresses skepticism about some of these explanations, particularly regarding liquidity and productivity-based justifications for higher valuations. They also caution against overreliance on the sustainability of high growth rates among dominant tech companies, as history has shown that market positions can change rapidly.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the importance of valuation in investment decisions, the author suggests that there is no clear consensus or simple answer to whether current stock market valuations are justified. They emphasize the complexity and uncertainty inherent in predicting future growth rates and economic cycles, which ultimately influence asset prices as present values of expected cash flows.
