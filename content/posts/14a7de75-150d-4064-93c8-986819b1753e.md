极右翼在欧洲议会选举中取得显著进展

# 欧洲议会选举结果

最近的**欧洲议会选举** 见证了极右翼政党的显著增长，预测显示他们可能占据欧洲议会 720 个席位中的近四分之一（25%）。这比 2019 年的五分之一有所增加。法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙在初步结果显示法国国民联盟的选票是他的中间派联盟的两倍多时，呼吁举行提前议会选举。

在德国，极右翼德国另类选择党（AfD）仅次于保守的基民盟-巴伐利亚基督教社会联盟反对党，领先于肖尔茨的联合政府政党。尽管最近发生了丑闻，AfD 仍获得了 15.6% 的选票。在意大利，总理乔尔贾·梅洛尼（Giorgia Meloni）的右翼兄弟党赢得了约 28.6% 的选票，超过了大选中的得票数，巩固了她在执政联盟中的主导地位。

中间派政党在新议会中仍保持多数席位，欧洲人民党（EPP）预计将赢得 184 个席位，其次是社会民主党，获得 139 个席位，自由派重生集团获得 80 个席位，而绿党则从 2019 年的 71 个席位下降到估计的 52 个。

极右翼政党的崛起预计将使欧洲议会倾向于反移民和反环保立场。然而，中间派政党仍占多数，这可能会影响乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）作为欧盟执行机构负责人的第二个任期。

 # Summary of Article: European Parliamentary Elections Results

The recent **European parliament elections** have seen significant gains by far-right parties, with projections suggesting they could hold almost a quarter (25%) of the ebel's 720 seats. This is an increase from one fifth in 2019. The French president Emmanuel Macron called for a snap parliamentary election after early results showed France’s Rassemblement National winning more than double the vote share of his centrist alliance.

In Germany, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in second place behind the conservative CDU-CSU opposition and outperformed Scholz's coalition parties. The AfD defied recent scandals to take 15.6% of the vote. In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Brothers of Italy clinched about 28.6% of the vote, improving on its tally in the general elections and strengthening her position as a dominant figure in her governing coalition.

The centre parties retained a majority in the new parliament with the European People's Party (EPP) set to win 184 seats, followed by Socialists and Democrats at 139 seats, liberal Renew group at 80 seats, and Greens falling from 71 seats in 2019 to an estimated 52.

The rise of far-right parties is expected to tilt the European parliament towards a more anti-immigration and anti-green stance. However, centre parties still hold a majority, which could impact Ursula von der Leyen's bid for a second term as head of the EU’s executive.
