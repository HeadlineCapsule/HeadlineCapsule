医疗保健支出如何让美国就业市场容易受到特朗普胜利的影响

# 医疗保健支出与就业市场脆弱性：特朗普连任的潜在影响

这篇文章讨论了人们对**美国就业市场**的担忧，尤其是医疗保健部门。分析师警告说，由于唐纳德·特朗普获胜的潜在影响以及新冠疫情延误的医疗程序的结束，就业增长的关键驱动力可能处于危险之中。

## 要点：

- **医疗保健支出**对就业创造做出了重大贡献，在过去一年中几乎占新就业岗位的一半。仅在2023年4月，卫生和社会援助领域就增加了8.7万个就业机会，占总就业增长17.5万的近一半。
- 就业增长归因于新冠疫情后的恢复，因为患者在封锁期间寻求推迟的医疗治疗。
- **医疗程序**，如结肠镜检查和基因检测，自2019年以来大幅增加，在某些情况下，数量增长超过16%。这种激增与预期之外的保险理赔数量增加有关。
- 平价医疗法案（ACA）和医疗补助计划的扩大也发挥了作用，加强了医疗保健部门的招聘力度。《平价医疗法案》市场注册人数在2024年1月达到2100万，比2020年增长一倍。
- 医疗保健就业市场的强劲为收入增长和通货膨胀率高提供了缓冲，因为它增加了美国在职人数。然而，一些分析师质疑这种增长是否能持续下去，因为积压问题正在得到解决。
- 特朗普总统任期内试图废除《平价医疗法案》并建议削减医疗补助计划，因此特朗普可能的总统任期可能会对医疗保健资金构成风险。这一不确定性可能导致医院重新考虑招聘计划。
- 一些共和党州实施的工作要求可能会导致150万美国人失去联邦资助的保险覆盖，根据国会预算办公室的数据。

总之，医疗保健支出是就业增长和对抗高通胀等经济挑战的重要驱动力，但由于特朗普总统任期内的潜在政策变化和其他影响医疗保健资金和医疗程序需求的因素，其未来存在不确定性。

 # Summary of Article on Healthcare Spending and Job Market Vulnerability in the Context of a Potential Trump Re-election

The article discusses concerns regarding the **US job market**, particularly within the healthcare sector. Analysts warn that this key driver of employment growth may be at risk due to potential repercussions from a Donald Trump victory and the conclusion of a surge in medical procedures delayed by Covid-19.

## Key Points:

- **Healthcare spending** has been a significant contributor to job creation, accounting for nearly half of new jobs over the past year. In April 2n34 alone, health and social assistance fields added 87,000 jobs out of a total of 175,000.
- The increase in employment is attributed to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic as patients seek postponed medical treatments during lockdowns.
- **Medical procedures** such as colonoscopies and genetic testing have seen substantial increases since 2019, with volumes jumping by over 16% in some cases. This surge is linked to higher insurance claims numbers than anticipated.
- Expansion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid has also played a role in strengthening hiring within the healthcare sector. ACA marketplace enrollment reached 21 million in January 2024, up from 11 million in 2020.
- The robustness of the healthcare job market is providing resilience to income rate hikes and high inflation rates by increasing the number of working Americans. However, some analysts question whether this growth can be sustained as backlogs are cleared.
- A potential Donald Trump presidency could pose risks for healthcare funding, with previous attempts to repeal the ACA and suggestions of cutting Medicaid during his first term in office. This uncertainty may lead hospitals to reconsider hiring plans if he wins again.
- The implementation of work requirements for recipients by several Republican-leaning states could result in 1.5 million Americans losing federal funding for their coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Authority.

In conclusion, while healthcare spending has been a significant driver of job growth and resilience against economic challenges such as high inflation rates, its future is uncertain due to potential policy changes under a Trump presidency and other factors that may impact funding and demand for medical procedures.
