# **乔·拜登** 命令中国加密货币挖矿公司出售靠近美军基地的土地

**乔·拜登**总统下令一家名为 **MineOne Partners** 的中资控股公司出售其在怀俄明州的土地，因为该土地靠近一个敏感的 **美国军事基地**。这家公司被给予 **120 天**的时间来遵守命令，因为白宫认为其加密货币挖矿业务中使用 **国外采购的技术**，可能对 **国家安全** 构成风险。

这块土地靠近 **沃伦空军基地**，该基地部署有洲际核弹道导弹。**拜登** 表示，**MineOne Partners** 使用的专业设备可能被用于 **监视** 和 **间谍活动**，从而对美国的国家安全造成重大风险。这次行动凸显了美国政府对外国实体在敏感军事设施附近运营的严格审查，尤其是那些可能接触到先进技术的实体。

这起事件也引发了人们对关键基础设施安全的担忧，以及外国投资在加密货币挖矿等领域可能带来的潜在风险，这些领域通常需要大量的技术资源和专业知识。

# Joe Biden orders Chinese crypto miner to sell land near US military base

President **Joe Biden** has ordered **MineOne Partners**, a Chinese-majority owned company, to sell its land in Wyoming due to its proximity to a sensitive **US military base**. The company has been given **120 days** to comply with the order, as the White House deems the presence of their crypto-mining operation, which includes **foreign-sourced technology**, as a potential **national security risk**. 

The land in question is located near **Warren Air Force Base**, which houses nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles. **Biden** stated that the specialized equipment used by MineOne could potentially enable **surveillance** and **espionage activities**, thus posing a significant risk to American national security. This enforcement highlights the US government's heightened scrutiny of foreign-owned entities operating near sensitive military installations, particularly those with potential access to advanced technologies.
