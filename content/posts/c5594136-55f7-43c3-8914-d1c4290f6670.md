硅谷加强员工审查以应对中国间谍威胁

# 摘要：
谷歌、OpenAI 和红杉资本等硅谷科技巨头正在加强安全审查流程，因为人们越来越担心中国间谍活动的威胁。在华盛顿和北京之间的战略竞争不断升级的背景下，美国官员在过去两年一直警告公司注意这一风险。

# 要点：
- 谷歌、OpenAI 和红杉资本等科技巨头正在加强对员工的安全审查，以防止外国政府窃取知识产权。
- 美国官员近年来加大了对中国间谍威胁的警告力度。
- 红杉资本等风险投资公司鼓励其投资组合公司加强对员工的审查，因为有警告称间谍机构正在针对美国科技开发人员。
- 前国家安全顾问麦克马斯特尔强调了中国情报机构构成的真实而持续的威胁。
- 公司可以利用战略情报工具来防止国家渗透其员工和第三方供应商/供应商，例如 Strider Technologies 提供的工具。
- 美国司法部因受到种族定位批评而取消了“中国计划”项目，但该项目确实导致了像哈佛大学化学教授查尔斯·利伯这样的案件的定罪，他通过国家赞助的项目接受了来自中国的资金。

# 建议：
1. 硅谷公司应继续加强安全审查流程，并保持警惕，尤其是针对外国政府（如中国）的潜在间谍威胁。
2. 与美国国防部门签订合同时，公司应扩大尽职调查范围，以保护自己免受中国间谍活动的威胁。
3. 企业可以考虑利用战略情报工具来加强对员工和第三方供应商/供应商的审查，例如 Strider Technologies 的数据工具，该工具使用人工智能收集有关外国情报机构方法的信息。

 **Summary:** Silicon Valley tech giants like Google, OpenAI, and Sequoia Capital are enhancing their security vetting processes due to increased concerns over the threat of Chinese espionage. US officials have warned companies about this risk for the past two years amidst growing strategic competition between Washington and Beijing.

**Key Points:**
- Tech giants such as Google, OpenAI, and Sequoia Capital are stepping up security vetting of staff to prevent intellectual property theft by foreign governments.
- US officials have increased warnings about Chinese espionage threats in recent years.
- Venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital encourage portfolio companies to tighten staff vetting after warnings that spy agencies are targeting US tech developers.
- HR McMaster, former national security adviser, emphasizes the real and persistent threat from Chinese intelligence agencies.
- Companamoeba Strider Technologies offers strategic intelligence tools for businesses to prevent nation states from infiltrating their employees and third-party vendors/suppliers.
- The US Justice Department scrapped the "China Initiative" program due to criticism of racial profiling, but it led to convictions like Harvard University chemistry professor Charles Lieber's case for accepting money from China through a state-sponsored program.

**Recommendations:**
1. Silicon Valley companies should continue enhancing their security vetting processes and remain vigilant against potential espionage threats, particularly those originating from foreign governments like China.
2. Companies bidding for contracts with the US defense department should widen the scope of due diligence to protect themselves from Chinese spy threats.
3. Businesses can consider utilizing strategic intelligence tools such as Strider Technologies' data tool, which uses AI to collect information on foreign intelligence agencies' methods and helps companies implement additional screening measures for their employees and third-party vendors/suppliers.
