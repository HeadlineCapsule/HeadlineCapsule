美国警告真主党挑衅，外交官试图避免以色列和黎巴嫩战争

**美国警告真主党“挑衅”行为，外交官试图避免以色列-黎巴嫩战争**

美国发出警告称，黎巴嫩激进组织真主党可能采取挑衅行动，导致以色列和黎巴嫩之间发生意外冲突。在紧张局势不断升级的情况下，误判的风险很高。

美国国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀强调，这样的战争将对所涉及的国家以及整个中东地区造成破坏。他敦促通过外交途径防止进一步升级，并在以色列与黎巴嫩北部边界恢复持久平静。

以色列国防部长雅伊夫·加兰特目前正在华盛顿与高级官员协商，讨论其与哈马斯在加沙的持续冲突以及与黎巴嫩北部边界的紧张局势。美国加紧了外交努力，以避免以色列和真主党之间发生全面战争，这种战争可能轻易成为区域冲突。

最近的事件是，在以色列部队杀死一名真主党高级指挥官后，过去几周来，每天都发生火力交流，这促使该激进组织向以色列北部发动了报复性火箭袭击。作为回应，总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡宣布计划在加沙冲突的“强化阶段”结束后，沿黎巴嫩边界重新部署部队。

美国和以色列官员都表示，他们更倾向于通过外交途径解决问题，而不是采取军事行动。然而，如果谈判失败，他们也在为潜在的战斗场景做准备。美国已警告真主党，如果该组织继续发动袭击，它将无法阻止以色列入侵黎巴嫩。

真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉上周在电视讲话中表示，他的组织不想与以色列发生“全面战争”，但同时也警告说，在加沙冲突结束之前，不可能停火。以色列和美国官员正在通过外交途径努力避免两国之间紧张局势的进一步升级。

 **US Warns of Hizbollah 'Provocations' as Diplomats Try to Avert Israel-Lebanon War**

The US has issued a warning regarding potential provocations from the Lebanese militant group, Hizbollah, which could lead to an unwanted conflict between Israel and Lebanon. The risk of miscalculation is high amidst escalating cross-border tensions. 

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin emphasized that such a war would be detrimental for both nations involved, as well as the entire Middle East region. He urged diplomacy to prevent further escalation and restore lasting calm along Israel's northern border with Lebanon.

Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant is currently in Washington consulting senior officials about its ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza, as well as the tensions on its northern border with Lebanon. The US has intensified diplomatic efforts to avert an all-out war between Israel and Hizbollah, which could easily become a regional conflict.

Recent events have seen daily exchanges of fire escalate sharply in recent weeks following the killing of a senior Hizbollah commander by Israeli forces. This prompted retaliatory rocket attacks from the militant group into northern Israel. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to redeploy troops along the border with Lebanon once the "intensive phase" of the Gaza conflict subsides.

Both US and Israeli officials have expressed a preference for diplomatic solutions over military action. However, they are also preparing for potential combat scenarios should negotiations fail. The US has warned Hizbollah that it would not be able to restrain Israel from invading Lebanon if the group continues its attacks.

Hizbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah stated in a televised address last week that his organization does "not want total war" with Israel, but also cautioned that there could not be a ceasefire until the Gaza conflict ends. Israeli and US officials are working towards an arrangement through diplomatic means to avoid further escalation of tensions between the two nations.
