美联储高级官员警告称，美国央行可能需要再次加息

**美联储官员：如果通货膨胀持续或恶化，可能需要再次加息**

美联储（Federal Reserve）高官米歇尔·鲍曼（Michelle Bowman）警告称，如果通货膨胀水平保持目前状态或恶化，美国央行可能需要再次加息。她指出，移民和联邦政府的大量支出是导致价格上涨速度快于其他发达经济体的原因。

**要点：**
- 美联储理事米歇尔·鲍曼支持在通货膨胀未见好转时进一步加息。
- 移民和强势财政刺激被确定为导致美国持续性通胀的潜在因素。
- 美联储内部对降息的决定存在争议，一些成员预计今年不会降息，而另一些成员则预计会降息一两次，每次降幅为0.25%。
- 鉴于选民对燃料、食品和其他商品成本上涨的担忧，乔·拜登总统已将应对高通胀作为其连任竞选的重要内容。
- 美国国会预算办公室预测，美国财政赤字将占GDP的7%，达到数万亿美元。
- 鲍曼还强调了宽松的金融条件和联邦刺激措施可能增加需求并导致进度放缓或通货膨胀加速的风险。
- 另一位美联储理事丽莎·库克（Lisa Cook）预计，随着消费者对商品成本上涨变得更加容忍，与住房相关的通货膨胀将在2025年有所缓解。

**结论：**
美联储正考虑进一步加息，以应对美国持续性通胀及其对经济的潜在影响。该机构内部对降息的决定存在分歧，不同成员根据自身对经济状况的评估给出不同的预期结果。

 **Article Summary:** 
A top Federal Reserve official, Michelle Bowman, has warned that the US central bank may need to raise interest rates again if inflation remains at its current level or worsens. She cites immigration and heavy federal spending as factors likely to keep prices rising more quickly than in other rich economies.

**Key Points:**
- Michelle Bowman, a Federal Reserve governor, supports further interest rate hikes if inflation does not improve.
- Immigration and aggressive fiscal stimulus are identified as potential factors contributing to persistent US inflation.
- The Fed's decision on cutting rates is debated within the institution, with some members expecting no cuts this year while others anticipate one or two quarter-point reductions.
- President Joe Biden has made tackling high inflation a key part of his re-election campaign amid voter concerns over rising costs for fuel, food, and other goods.
- The US fiscal deficit is projected to reach eby the Congressional Budget Office at 7% of GDP this year.
- Bowman also highlights potential risks from looser financial conditions and federal stimulus adding momentum to demand, which could stall progress or cause inflation to accelerate.
- Another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, expects housing-related inflation to ease in 2025 as consumers become less tolerant of higher costs for goods.

**Conclusion:**
The Federal Reserve is considering further interest rate hikes amid concerns over persistent US inflation and its potential impact on the economy. The decision on cutting rates remains debated within the institution, with various members expecting different outcomes based on their assessment of economic conditions.
