特朗普-拜登辩论观众人数减少，选民对美国大选失去兴趣

**美国总统辩论观众人数减少**

唐纳德·特朗普和乔·拜登之间最近在CNN举办的总统辩论会比前几次选举的观众人数大幅下降。有4800万电视观众观看了这场活动，另有3000万人通过数字渠道或YouTube收看。今年，美国媒体机构的选举报道兴趣下降的趋势继续下去。

CNN为辩论制定了不寻常的规则，例如不允许现场观众和发言时麦克风被关闭。主持人扮演了背景角色，让特朗普和拜登在没有中断或实时事实核查的情况下进行对话。这种格式似乎对特朗普有利，他在90分钟的节目中提出了几项未经证实的说法。

辩论的收视率较低，给CNN带来了挑战，该网络一直在努力根据新首席执行官马克·汤普森爵士（Sir Mark Thompson）的要求复兴其品牌和业务。尽管做出了这些努力，但该网络因其在活动中的事实核查处理方式而面临批评。特朗普竞选团队利用这一点，向支持者发送了一封电子邮件，称赞CNN提供了一个平台，让他们可以“横扫”拜登。

**要点：**

1. **4800万电视观众** 观看了周四的美国总统辩论，远低于前几次选举的观众人数。

2. 该活动采用不寻常的规则，例如不允许现场观众和发言时麦克风被关闭。

3. CNN因其在辩论中的实时事实核查不足而面临批评。

4. 尽管面临挑战，但该网络仍在努力根据首席执行官马克·汤普森爵士（Sir Mark Thompson）的要求复兴其品牌。

 **Summary of US Presidential Debate Drawing Smaller Audience**

The recent presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, hosted by CNN, witnessed a significant drop in viewership compared to previous elections. The event was watched by 48 million television viewers, with an additional 30 million tuning in through digital channels or YouTube. This decline continues the trend of decreasing interest in US media outlets' election coverage this year.

CNN implemented atypical rules for the debate, such as no live audience and muted microphones when not speaking. The moderators played a background role, allowing a back-and-forth dialogue between Trump and Biden without interruption or fact-checking in real time. This format seemed to favor Trump, who made several unsubstantiated claims during the 90-minute program.

The debate's lower viewership poses challenges for CNN, which has been working on revitalizing its brand and business under new CEO Sir Mark Thompson. Despite these efforts, the network faced criticism over its handling of fact-checking during the event. The Trump campaign capitalized on this by sending an email to supporters praising CNN for providing a platform where they could "wipe the floor" with Biden.

**Key Points:**

1. **48 million television viewers** watched Thursday's US presidential debate, significantly fewer than previous elections.
2. The event featured atypical rules such as no live audience and muted microphones when not speaking.
3. CNN faced criticism for its lack of real-time fact-checking during the debate.
4. Despite challenges, the network continues to work on revitalizing its brand under CEO Sir Mark Thompson.
