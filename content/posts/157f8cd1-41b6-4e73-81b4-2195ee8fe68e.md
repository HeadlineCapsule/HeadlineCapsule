ESG成本是亚洲基金经理面临的越来越大的挑战。

## 摘要：
文章讨论了亚洲基金经理在环境、社会和治理（ESG）能力方面与欧洲和美国同行保持同步时面临的挑战。建立ESG团队和遵守可持续投资政策的相关费用不断上涨，给小型企业的利润率带来了压力。资产所有者越来越多地将ESG能力作为最低要求，但人才、技术和数据资源的竞争正在加剧。由于在获取数据和方法方面存在困难，亚洲基金经理可能难以将可持续性作为核心商业价值来接受。

## 有趣的问题：

1. **问题：**不断上涨的ESG成本如何影响与欧洲和美国大型同行相比的亚洲小型基金经理？

   - **答案：**亚洲小型基金经理在满足对ESG能力日益增长的需求方面面临更大的挑战，因为他们可用的资源较少。人才、技术和数据资源竞争加剧进一步加剧了这一问题。因此，小型企业可能难以达到资产所有者设定的最低要求，或者在与拥有更成熟的ESG能力的全球大型基金巨头相比时，在市场竞争中处于劣势。

2. **问题：**亚洲基金经理在可持续投资方面有哪些潜在优势？

   - **答案：**亚洲基金经理的一个优势可能是他们在全球投资者往往忽视的市场中的现场存在，这可以使他们识别ESG机会并与当地投资者建立信任。此外，他们可以提出“亚洲方式”的可持续投资方法，考虑到该地区气候信息披露的标准较低，从而对ESG问题提供不同的观点。

3. **问题：**亚洲基金经理如何解决获取ESG实践的数据和方法的挑战？

   - **答案：**为了克服这些挑战，亚洲基金经理可以与当地合作伙伴或联合国开发计划署等组织合作，制定针对该地区的框架和能力。他们还可以投资于建立内部专业知识，雇用在ESG事务方面经验丰富的人员，并为现有员工提供培训。通过这些方式，他们可以提高获取与亚洲背景下的可持续投资实践相关的数据和方法的能力。

4. **问题：**不遵守不断发展的ESG标准可能会给区域资产管理公司带来哪些潜在风险？

   - **答案：**不遵守快速发展的ESG标准可能会使区域资产管理公司面临严重的声誉风险，从而影响他们吸引和留住投资者的能力。此外，这可能会给从重视可持续投资实践的海外投资者那里筹集资金带来挑战。因此，这些公司可能会在市场份额上输给拥有更成熟的ESG能力的全球基金巨头。

5. **问题：**亚洲基金经理如何在保持盈利的同时平衡对ESG能力的需求和相关成本？

## Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by Asian fund managers as they try to keep up with their European and US counterparts in terms of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) capabilities. The rising costs associated with building ESG teams and complying with sustainable investing policies are putting pressure on profit margins for smaller firms. Asset owners increasingly require ESG capabilities as a minimum requirement, but the competition for talent, technology, and data resources is growing. Asian fund managers may struggle to embrace sustainability as a core business value due to difficulties in acquiring data and methodology.

## Interesting Questions:
1. **Q:** How do rising ESG costs impact smaller Asian fund managers compared to their larger European and US counterparts? 
   - **A:** Smaller Asian fund managers face a greater challenge when trying to keep up with the growing demand for ESG capabilities, as they have fewer resources available. The increased competition for talent, technology, and data resources further exacerbates this issue. As a result, smaller firms may struggle to meet minimum requirements set by asset owners or compete effectively in the marketplace against larger global fund giants with more established ESG capabilities.
   
2. **Q:** What are some potential advantages for Asian fund managers when it comes to sustainable investing? 
   - **A:** One advantage that Asian fund managers may have is their on-the-ground presence in markets often neglected by global investors, which could allow them to identify ESG opportunities and build trust with local investors. Additionally, they can propose an "Asian way" of sustainable investing that takes into account the lower standards of climate disclosures in the region, potentially leading to differentiated perspectives on ESG issues.
   
3. **Q:** How might Asian fund managers address challenges related to acquiring data and methodology for ESG practices? 
   - **A:** To overcome these challenges, Asian fund managers could collaborate with local partners or organizations like the UN Development Programme to develop region-specific frameworks and capabilities. They may also invest in building internal expertise by hiring personnel experienced in ESG matters and providing training for existing staff members. By doing so, they can improve their ability to acquire data and methodology relevant to sustainable investing practices within the Asian context.
   
4. **Q:** What are some potential risks that non-adherence to evolving ESG standards may pose for regional asset managers? 
   - **A:** Non-adherence to rapidly evolving ESG standards can expose regional asset managers to significant reputational risks, which could impact their ability to attract and retain investors. Additionally, it may create challenges in raising capital from offshore investors who prioritize sustainable investing practices. As a result, these firms may lose market share to global fund giants with more established ESG capabilities.
   
5. **Q:** How can Asian fund managers balance the need for ESG capabilities and the associated costs while maintaining profitability? 
   - **A:** To strike this balance, Asian fund managers may consider adopting a phased approach to building out their ESG capabilities, foccuing on areas that are most relevant to their investors or regions of focus. They can also explore partnerships with other firms or organizations to share resources and expertise in developing sustainable investing practices. Additionally, they should continuously monitor the evolving landscape of ESG standards and adjust their strategies accordingly to ensure long-term profitability while meeting minimum requirements set
