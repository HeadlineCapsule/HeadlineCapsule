# 投资者注意：**商业发展公司**的私人信用风险加剧 

随着美国私人信用领域面临越来越多的压力，**商业发展公司（BDCs）** 受到严格审查。**BDCs** 为中型市场企业提供贷款，但一直以来备受批评：手续费高、贷款标准松懈，而外部赞助商则优先考虑资产增长。尽管过去十年回报健康，但 **穆迪（Moody's）** 的最新报告强调了人们的担忧，尤其是贷款 **逾期** 增加，以及使用 **"支付实物选择权"** 条款，表明借款人面临压力。

有研究称，对净资产的实际收费超过 5%，因此**BDCs** 的收费结构也受到批评。业绩差异很大，一些公司表现良好，如 **Ares Management** 旗下的 BDC 股价高于净资产值，而其他公司则面临挑战，如 **FS KKR**。**BDCs** 的公开性质提供了永久资本，但私募 **BDCs**，如 **Blackstone 的 BCRED**，也正在吸引零售投资者，逐渐受到青睐。随着信用周期变得更加动荡，投资者在 **BDCs** 和他们的赞助商之间面临选择，考虑到 **BDCs** 收取的管理费，后者可能提供更好的回报。

# Investors beware: BDCs show stress in private credit 

**Business Development Companies** (**BDCs**) have come under scrutiny as the private credit sector in the US faces increased stress. BDCs, which provide loans to mid-market businesses, have been criticized for high fees and lax underwriting standards, with external sponsors prioritizing asset growth. Despite healthy returns over the past decade, recent reports from **Moody's** highlight concerns, particularly the increase in loan **nonaccruals** and the use of **"payment in kind"** toggles, indicating borrower stress. 

With a study citing effective fees on net assets exceeding 5%, BDCs have also been criticized for their fee structure. Performance varies widely, with some, like the BDC sponsored by **Ares Management**, trading above net asset value, while others, like **FS KKR**, face challenges. The public nature of BDCs provides permanent capital, but private BDCs, like **Blackstone's BCRED**, are gaining traction by attracting retail investors. As the credit cycle becomes more volatile, investors have a choice between BDCs and their sponsors, with the latter potentially offering better returns given the management fees charged by BDCs.
