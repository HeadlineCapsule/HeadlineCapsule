投资者预测法国议会将出现悬峙议会，市场因此上涨

**新闻摘要：**

法国市场上涨，欧元对美元汇率上升，因为投资者预测在周日议会选举中，玛丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）的国民联盟党（RN）赢得第一后，将出现悬峙议会。周一开市时，法国富时100指数上涨2.7%，而欧元上涨0.5%，达到1.077美元。

中间派和左翼政党同意进行有限的选举合作，以阻止极右翼掌权。他们正在考虑在数百场选举决胜轮中撤回候选人，以避免分裂反国民联盟的选票。根据《金融时报》的计算，第一轮选举产生了300多场三方决胜轮。

马克龙总统的总理加布里埃尔·阿塔勒（Gabriel Attal）表示，他们的目标很明确：阻止国民联盟在第二轮选举中获得绝对多数并执政，因为这将带来灾难性的后果。巴黎HEC商学院法律和税收教授阿明·斯坦巴赫（Armin Steinbach）认为，国民联盟下周最有可能获得相对多数席位。

如果国民联盟赢得多数席位，马克龙将不得不与约旦巴德拉（Jordan Bardella）组成不舒服的联合政府，后者将成为总理。这种“共存”的可能性从未涉及过观点如此相左的政党和领导人。

 **Article Summary:**

French markets rallied and the euro climbed against the dollar as investors predicted a hung parliament after Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN) party won first place in Sunday's parliamentary elections. The Cac cuadro index rose by 2.7% at market open on Monday, while the euro gained 0.5 to $1.077.

The centrist and left-wing parties agreed to limited electoral cooperation to block the far right from taking power. They are considering withdrawing candidates in hundreds of election runoffs to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote. The first round produced more than 300 three-way runoffs, according to Financial Times calculations.

Macron's prime minister Gabriel Attal said that their objective is clear: stopping RN from having an absolute majority in the second round and governing the country with its disastrous project. Armin Steinbach, professor of law and tax at HEC Paris business school, believes a relative majority for the RN is the most likely outcome next week.

If the RN wins a majority, Macron would be forced into an uncomfortable power-sharing arrangement with Jordan Bardella as prime minister. The possibility of such "cohabitation" has never involved parties and leaders with such contrasting views before.
