美联储高官称美国零售销售放缓增大降息概率

**新闻摘要：**
美国联邦储备委员会（Fed）高级官员阿德里娜·库格勒（Adriana Kugler）表示，由于零售销售和消费者支出放缓的迹象，货币政策可能会发生变化。根据这篇文章，有证据表明大型零售商正在降低价格以留住注重成本的消费者，这表明消费者支出持续放缓。库格勒认为，这一趋势可能导致通货膨胀率下降到Fed的2%目标，并可能使中央银行今年下调利率适当。

**要点：**
- **阿德里娜·库格勒，美国联邦储备委员会官员** 表示，零售销售放缓可能会导致通货膨胀率下降到Fed的2%目标，并增加中央银行今年下调利率的可能性。
- 零售商如Target和Walmart正在数千种商品上降低价格，因为消费者转向更实惠的产品，这表明消费者支出出现新的弱点。
- Fed最新的“点图”预测显示，预计今年将降息一次，而3月份之前则预计降息三次。
- 经济整体降温和失业率上升的其他迹象可能会影响中央银行关于利率的决定，库格勒强调了密切关注失业数据的重要性。

 **Article Summary:**  
A top US Federal Reserve official, Adriana Kugler, has indicated a potential shift in monetary policy due to signs of slowing retail sales and consumer spending. According to the article, there is evidence that big retailers are lowering prices to retain cost-conscious consumers, suggesting an ongoing deceleration in consumer spending. Kugler bels this trend may lead to a decrease in inflation towards the Fed's 2% goal and could make it appropriate for the central bank to cut interest rates later this year.

**Key Points:**  
- **Adriana Kugler, US Federal Reserve official**, suggests that slowing retail sales may lead to a decrease in inflation towards the Fed's 2% goal and an increase in chances of rate cuts by the central bank this year.
- Retailers like Target and Walmart are lowering prices on thousands of items as consumers trade down to more affordable products, indicating new weaknesses in consumer spending.
- The Fed's latest "dot-plot" projections show a decrease from three rate cuts previously forecasted in March to just one this year.
- Other signs of cooling across the economy and an increase in jobless rates may influence the central bank's decision on interest rates, with Kugler emphasizing the importance of monitoring unemployment data closely.
