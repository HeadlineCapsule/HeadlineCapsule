# 撤资股份：效果如何？

**撤资** 作为一种推动政治、环境或社会变革的策略，是一个复杂和漫长的过程，需要全面的方法。虽然它可以提高目标公司的 **资本成本** 并放大推动变革的声音，但其有效性往往取决于配套的策略，如制裁和政策支持。撤资运动的成功依赖于一个 "宏观 "策略和大量投资者的参与。

撤资是一场长期游戏，股份的抛售过程需要谨慎管理和分阶段进行，以避免全面倾销，这可能会损害投资者的利益。化石燃料行业的目标明确，在撤资运动方面取得了一些成功，但即便如此，像俄罗斯-乌克兰冲突这样的外部因素仍会影响石油价格和股价。

最近对 **迷因股** 和由社区推动的投资现象的关注为这一讨论增加了新的复杂层面。AMC Entertainment 公司的案例凸显了如何利用 "Ape "形象的社区驱动方法来影响股价，尽管该公司面临财务困境和即将到来的债务重组。

撤资策略的有效性最终取决于其是否能够带来持久变革，这需要足够数量的投资者和协调良好的方法，从多个角度解决目标问题。

# Divesting Shares: Does It Work? 

**Divestment** as a strategy to influence political, environmental, or social change is a complex and lengthy process that requires a comprehensive approach. While it can increase the targeted companies' **cost of capital** and amplify voices driving change, its effectiveness is often dependent on accompanying strategies such as sanctions and political will. The success of divestment campaigns relies on a "big picture" strategy and a significant mass sign-up by investors. 

Divestment is a long-term game, and the process of offloading shares is carefully managed and staggered to avoid wholesale dumping, which could be detrimental to investors. The fossil fuel industry, with its clear targets, has seen some success with divestment campaigns, but even then, external factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict can influence oil prices and share values. 

The recent focus on **meme stocks** and the community-driven investment phenomenon adds a new layer of complexity to the discussion. The case of AMC Entertainment highlights how a community-driven approach, leveraging the "Ape" avatar, can influence stock prices despite the company's financial struggles and impending debt restructuring. 

The effectiveness of divestment as a strategy ultimately lies in its ability to create lasting change, which requires a critical mass of investors and a well-coordinated approach that addresses the targeted issue from multiple angles.
