工党将就提高私募股权老板税收的计划进行咨询。

**工党对私募股权老板征税的计划**

由基尔·斯塔默爵士领导的工党宣布，它打算咨询一项可能导致对私募股权老板征收更高税收的计划。这一举措是该党“创造财富”的更广泛承诺的一部分，并将纳入他们的选举宣言。

**要点：**
- 工党领袖基尔·斯塔默承诺将创造财富置于其选举宣言的核心。
- 该计划涉及就对私募股权老板征收更高税收进行咨询，目标是“随行权益”税收漏洞。
- 影子财政大臣瑞秋·里夫斯此前曾呼吁增加4.4亿英镑对私募股权部门的征税，并相信如果实施该计划，不会出现从英国外流的情况。
- 目前，私募股权高管收到的“随行权益”付款按28%的资本收益税率征税，但工党可能会提出在该税率和最高所得税税率45%之间进行妥协。
- 斯塔默和里夫斯认为，对私募股权老板征收更高税收不会与他们的亲商消息相冲突。

**其他关键政策：**
- 工党的曼彻斯特宣言包括一项“让英国再次建设”的计划，其中包括旨在在多年低迷的生产力后刺激英国经济增长的规划和能源改革。
- 将创建一家名为Great British Energy的国家拥有的公司，以及一个国家财富基金，以实现重工业脱碳。
- 工党计划推出一项10年基础设施战略，并通过权力下放从威斯敏斯特转移权力。
- 该党的“为劳动人民的新交易”就业改革一揽子计划将得到强调，第一任期计划采取六项关键措施：经济稳定、缩短国民保健服务等待时间、成立边境安全司令部、建立Great British Energy、打击反社会行为以及招募6500名新教师。
- 影子国防大臣约翰·希利宣布，国防将是工党增长使命的核心，并计划改革国防采购和更新英国的国防工业战略。

 **Labour Party's Plan for Taxing Private Equity Bosses**

The Labour party, led by Sir Keir Starmer, has announced its intention to consult on a plan that could result in higher taxes being imposed on private equity bosses. This move is part of the party's broader commitment to "wealth creation" and will be included in their election manifesto.

**Key Points:**
- Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pledges to put wealth creation at heart of his election manifesto.
- The plan involves consulting on imposing higher taxes on private equity bosses, targeting the "carried interest" tax loophole.
- Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously called for an increase in taxes on the private equity sector by £440mn and is confident that there will be no exodus from the UK if such a plan were to be implemented.
- The current "carried interest" payments received by private equity executives are taxed at 28% capital gangs tax rate, but Labour may propose a compromise between this rate and the top er income tax of 45%.
- Starmer and Reeves argue that higher taxes on private equity bosses will not conflict with their pro-business message.

**Other Key Policies:**
- The Labour party's manifesto launch in Manchester includes a plan to "get Britain building again," which involves planning and energy reforms aimed at stimulating UK economic growth after years of sluggish productivity.
- A new state-owned company called Great British Energy will be created, along with a National Wealth Fund for decarbonizing heavy industry.
- Labour plans to introduce a 10-year infrastructure strategy and shift power away from Westminster through devolution.
- The party's "New Deal for Working People" package of employment reforms will be highlighted, with six key steps planned in the first term: economic stability, cutting NHS waiting times, launching a Border Security Command, setting up Great British Energy, cracking down on antisocial behavior, and recruiting 6,500 new teachers.
- Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey has announced that defence will be at the heart of Labour's mission for growth, with plans to reform defense procurement and update the UK's defense industrial strategy.
