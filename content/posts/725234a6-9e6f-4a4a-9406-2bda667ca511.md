铜价将飙升至每吨 4万美元，顶级交易员安德兰德称。

## 摘要： 

对冲基金经理皮埃尔·安杜兰（Pierre Andurand）预测，**铜价** 在未来几年内可能上涨至每吨4万美元，原因是需求增加且全球库存量低。这一预测是在他之前看涨石油的押注去年导致重大损失后做出的。自今年年初以来，铜价已经上涨了近20%，一度达到每吨1.1万美元。安杜兰将预期的需求增长归因于电气化（包括电动汽车、太阳能电池板、风电场）、军事用途和数据中心等因素。他还指出，开发一座新矿山大约需要15年时间，这可能无法满足不断增长的需求。

## 值得思考的问题： 

**Q:皮埃尔·安杜兰对铜价将达到每吨4万美元预测是基于哪些因素？**  
**A:** 该预测的主要依据是全球对铜的需求预计将增加，因为铜在能源转型、电动汽车、太阳能电池板、风电场等行业以及军事用途和数据中心中发挥着关键作用。此外，安杜兰认为供应难以跟上需求增长，因为开发新的矿山通常需要15年时间，这意味着仅靠提高采矿努力水平可能无法满足不断增长的需求。

**Q:皮埃尔·安杜兰对铜价的预测与他对石油价格的之前预测有何不同？**  
**A:** 与他去年看涨石油的押注所造成的重大损失形成对比，安杜兰现在对潜在的供应中断及其对商品价格的影响抱以更谨慎的态度。他曾预测油价将上涨至每桶140美元，但承认了从预期但未发生的供应中断中吸取了痛苦教训。因此，他不再期待原油价格大幅上涨，并认为地缘政治风险对石油供应稳定性影响不大。

**Q:除了铜之外，皮埃尔·安杜兰还看好哪些大宗商品？原因是什么？**  
**A:** 除铜之外，安杜兰还看好可可和铝价。今年年初至4月中旬，可可价格已经翻了两倍，这归因于供应链中断、气候变化以及象牙海岸和加纳等主要生产国政治不稳定等因素。与铜类似，由于铝可以替代各种应用中的红色金属，因此预计其价格也会上涨，从而导致建筑、运输和包装等行业的需求增加。

## Summary:
Hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand predicts that **copper prices** could rise to $40,000 a tonne within the next few years due to increasing demand and low global stockpiles. This forecast comes after his previous bullish oil bets resulted in significant losses last year. The price of copper has already risen by almost eby 20% this year, reaching $11,000 a tonne at one point. Andurand attributes the expected demand growth to factors such as **electrification** (including electric vehicles, solar panels, wind farms), military usage, and data centers. He also notes that it takes approximately 15 years to develop a new mine, which may not be sufficient to meet rising demand.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: What factors contribute to Pierre Andurand's prediction of copper prices reaching $40,000 per tonne?
A: The primary factor contributing to this prediction is the expected increase in global demand for copper due to its critical role in various sectors such as energy transition (electric vehicles, solar panels, wind farms), military usage, and data centers. Additionally, Andurand believes that supply struggles to keep up with demand because it takes around 15 years to develop a new mine, making it difficult for the industry to meet rising demand through increased mining efforts alone.

Q: How does Pierre Andurand's prediction of copper prices compare to his previous predictions on oil prices?
A: In contrast to his bullish oil bets that resulted in significant losses last year, Andurand is now more cautious about potential supply disruptions and their impact on commodity prices. He previously predicted oil prices would rise to $140 a barrel but acknowledges the painful lessons learned from expecting supply disruption that did not occur. As such, he no longer expects a large run-up in crude prices and believes geopolitical risks have had little impact on oil supply stability.

Q: What other commodities does Pierre Andurand hold bullish views on, and what are the reasons behind these predictions?
A: In addition to copper, Andurand holds a bullish view on cocoa and aluminum prices. Cocoa prices have tripled from the start of this year until mid-April due to factors such as supply chain disruptions caused by climate change and political instability in major producing countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana. Aluminum, similar to copper, is expected to rise in price because it can be substituted for the red metal in various applications, leading to increased demand from industries such as construction, transportation, and packaging.
