查佩尔必须因BHS倒闭支付至少5000万英镑

# 法院判决多米尼克·查佩尔（Dominic Chappell）必须因英国零售商BHS倒闭而偿还至少5000万英镑。

高等法院裁定，他试图“掠夺”该公司，并因不当交易、渎职和违反信托责任而负有责任。查佩尔在接管BHS时缺乏管理大型零售商的经验，现在必须支付2150万英镑的不当交易索赔，以及1750万英镑的违反信托责任费用，再加上费用和利息。该命令需经法官最终批准。

法院还裁定，其他两名前董事因BHS倒闭而分别负有至少1800万英镑的责任。查佩尔声称由于资金短缺和健康问题，他没有获得法律咨询，但法官裁定他未能充分应对针对他的指控。

 **Summary:** 

The High Court ruled that Dominic Chappell must repay a minimum of £50mn due to his involvement in the collapse of BHS, a UK retailer. The court found that he had sought to "plunder" the company and was liable for wrongful trading, misfeasance, and breach of fiduciary duty. Chappell, who lacked experience in running large retailers when he took charge of BHS, must pay £21.5mn for a wrongful trading claim, £ 17.5mn for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest. The order is subject to final approval from the judge.

The court also found that two other former directors were liable for at least £18mn each in connection with their roles in BHS's collapse. Chappell claimed he had no legal counsel due to lack of funds and raised health concerns, but the judge ruled that he failed to adequately address any allegations against him.
