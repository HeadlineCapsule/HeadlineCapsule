# **以色列5名士兵在加沙激烈战斗中被误伤致死**

**五名以色列伞兵** 在周三晚上的**误伤事件中丧生** ，当时以色列国防军（**IDF**）正在加沙地带对哈马斯开展地面作战行动。事件发生时，一辆**以色列坦克** 在贾巴利亚（加沙北部的一个难民营）人口稠密的城市地区发生激烈战斗时，可能由于**误认** 而两次向伞兵开火。自10月下旬地面行动开始以来，包括误伤事件在内，因事故死亡的以色列士兵人数已增至49人。

以色列国防军在北部加沙的废墟地区与哈马斯武装分子进行**近身作战** 时面临挑战，并因未经正确识别目标而开火受到人权组织的批评。此前发生的其他误伤事件，包括造成联合国和国际援助人员死亡的误伤事件，使以色列国防军面临压力，并因此作出道歉和检讨。

与此同时，以色列与哈马斯的冲突升级，以及以色列与黎巴嫩和真主党北部边境的紧张局势加剧，给本杰明·内塔尼亚胡总理带来了政治上的审视，他因缺乏战时战略和在加沙战后治理问题上的优柔寡断而受到批评。

# Friendly fire kills 5 Israeli soldiers amid intense fighting in Gaza

**Five Israeli paratroopers** were killed in a **friendly-fire incident** on Wednesday night, as the Israel Defense Forces (**IDF**) continue their ground combat operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The incident occurred when an **Israeli tank** fired twice on the paratroopers, likely due to **misidentification** during fierce fighting in a dense urban area of Jabalia, a northern Gaza refugee camp. This brings the toll of Israeli soldiers killed in accidents, including friendly fire, to 49 since the start of ground operations in late October. 

The IDF faces challenges in targeting Hamas militants in **close-quarters combat** in devastated areas of northern Gaza, and has been criticized by human rights groups for opening fire without proper target identification. This incident follows other recent friendly-fire events, including the fatal shooting of international UN and aid staff, which have strained relations and prompted apologies and reviews from the IDF. 

The escalation of conflict with Hamas, as well as increased tensions on Israel's northern border with Lebanon and Hezbollah, comes at a time of political scrutiny for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been criticized for his lack of wartime strategy and indecision regarding postwar governance in Gaza.
