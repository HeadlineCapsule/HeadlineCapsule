美国监管机构就波音公司对机门调查的披露采取了处罚措施

# 美国监管机构制裁波音公司

国家运输安全委员会（NTSB）因波音公司公然违反调查法规和关于调查一架飞机在飞行中失去门板事件的签署协议而对其进行制裁。该制造商披露了有关该询问的信息，包括对其原因的猜测，导致美国监管机构采取了这一行动。

# 波音公司失去获取调查信息的渠道

由于受到制裁，波音公司将无法获得NTSB在对1月份涉及737 Max飞机事故的调查中发现的任何调查信息。该飞机制造商此前曾举行简报会，向记者介绍了其质量改进努力，并就超越了NTSB作为调查信息来源的角色而道歉。

# 波音公司面临多项调查

该事件进一步 strain 了波音公司与联邦航空管理局（FAA）和司法部的关系。该公司目前因该事件而面临多项调查。

# NTSB传唤波音公司参加听证会

除了失去获取NTSB调查信息的渠道外，波音公司还被该机构传唤参加8月的听证会。该公司曾邀请记者参观其西雅图附近的设施，并听取高管关于其在事件后如何改善安全和质量措施的计划。

# 初步报告发现门板上缺少螺栓

NTSB的一份初步报告显示，用于固定门板的四个螺栓缺失，导致737 Max在起飞后不久从机身脱离。

 **US Regulators Sanction Boeing**  

The National Transportaturation Safety Board (NTSB) sanctioned Boeing for blatantly violating investigative regulations and a signed agreement governing the investigation into an incident where a door panel blew off a jet mid-flight. The manufacturer's disclosure of information about the inquiry, including speculation on its cause, led to this action by US regulators.

**Boeing Loses Access to Investigative Information**  

As a result of the sanction, Boeing will lose access to any investigative information uncovered by the NTSB during their investigation into the January accident involving the 737 Max aircraft. The plane maker had previously held a briefing with journalists detailing its quality improvement efforts and apologized for overstepping the NTSB's role as the source of investigative information.

**Boeing Faces Multiple Investigations**  

The incident has further strained relations between Boeing and government agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Justice. The company is currently facing multiple investigations in light of this event.

**NTSB Subpoenas Boeing for Hearing**  

In addition to losing access to information from the NTSB's investigation, Boeing has been subpoenaed by the agency to appear at a hearing in August. The company had invited reporters to tour its facilities near Seattle and hear from top executives about how it intends to improve safety and quality measures following this incident.

**Preliminary Report Finds Missing Bolts on Door Panel**  

A preliminary report by the NTSB found that four bolts meant to secure the door panel were missing, which led to its violent detachment from the fuselage of the 737 Max shortly after take-off.
