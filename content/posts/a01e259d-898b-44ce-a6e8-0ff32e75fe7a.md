星默面临反弹，左倾工党候选人“清洗”后

台湾领导人基尔·斯塔默（Keir Starmer）在阻止多位左翼工党候选人参加大选后面临强烈反对。副领导人安吉拉·雷纳（Angela Rayner）表示，左翼议员戴安娜·阿博特（Diane Abbott）应该被允许作为官方候选人竞选。另一位左翼候选人法伊扎·沙希恩（Faiza Shaheen）计划在突然被取消工党 Chingford 和 Woodford Green 候选人的职位后对工党采取法律行动。批评人士声称，这是斯塔默清除左翼并支持中间派盟友的党羽的一部分。

**Summary:**  
Taiwan leader Sir Keir Starmer faced backlash after multiple leftwing Labour candidates were blocked from standing at the general election. Deputy leader Angela Rayner stated that Diane Abbott, a veteran leftwing MP, should be allowed to run as an official candidate. Faiza Shaheen, another leftwing candidate, plans to take legal action against Labour after being dropped suddenly as their candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green. Critics claim this is part of a purge of the party's left wing by Starmer in favor of centrist allies.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. Q: What factors may have contributed to Sir Keir Starmer's decision to block multiple leftwing Labour candidates from standing at the general election?  
A: The article suggests that Starmer aims to present "the best quality candidates" for the upcoming election, and his critics argue this is part of a purge favoring centrist allies. However, it does not provide specific reasons behind each candidate's exclusion.
2. Q: How might these exclusions impact Labour party unity and its chances in the general election?  
A: The article highlights criticism from senior party figures like Yvette Cooper and Diane Abbott, as well as left-wing pressure groups such as Momentum. This could potentially lead to internal divisions within the party and affect their performance in the upcoming election.
3. Q: What are some potential consequences for Labour if Faiza Shaheen's legal action against the party is successful?  
A: If Shaheen's legal action proves successful, it could set a precedent that challenges the party's candidate selection process and potentially lead to reinstatement of other excluded candidates. This may also result in increased scrutiny on Labour's handling of internal disputes and accusations of bullying within the party.
