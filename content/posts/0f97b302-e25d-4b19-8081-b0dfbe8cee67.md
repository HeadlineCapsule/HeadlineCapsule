阿根廷败诉，需向对冲基金支付15亿美元

# 摘要：
本文讨论了阿根廷最近遭遇的挫折，因为其对向四家对冲基金支付15亿美元的判决提出的上诉被伦敦法院驳回。这一裁决对杰夫·米莱（Javier Milei）的现金紧缺政府不利，该政府面临着前外国投资者的多项法律挑战。

# 要点：
- 阿根廷对向对冲基金支付15亿美元的判决提出的上诉被伦敦法院驳回。
- 这一裁决对杰夫·米莱（Javier Milei）现金紧缺的政府不利，该政府面临着前外国投资者的多项法律挑战。
- 2013年，阿根廷改变了计算GDP的方式，并认为不需要支付与GDP增长挂钩的欧元证券的利息。
- Palladian Partners、HBK Master Fund、Hirsh Group和Virtual Emerald International Limited持有这些受英国法律管辖的证券的大约数量。他们于2019年对阿根廷提起诉讼，要求因损失获得赔偿。
- 法院于2023年裁定对冲基金胜诉。
- 阿根廷经济目前正经历严重的经济危机，通货膨胀高企，外汇储备低迷。向对冲基金支付款项可能会影响其偿还其他债务的能力，并损害阿根廷人民的利益。
- 自克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德斯·德基什内尔（Cristina Fernández de Kirchner）政府（2007-2015）以来，该国一直面临着前投资者的多项法律挑战。去年，纽约法院裁定阿根廷有责任向国家能源公司YPF的两名前股东支付160亿美元。
- Latam Advisors的塞巴斯蒂安·马里尔（Sebastián Maril）认为，这一裁决证明了阿根廷的法律策略无效，并建议与判决债权人就未来的还款时间表进行谈判。
- 阿根廷不太可能在短期内支付13.3亿欧元加上利息的全额判决，因为其外汇储备几乎为零。

 **Summary:**  
The article discusses Argentina's recent setback as its appeal against a $1.5 billion payment to four hedge funds was rejected by a London court. The ruling is detrimental for Javier Milei’s cash-strapped government, which faces multiple legal challenges from former foreign investors.

**Key Points:**  
- Argentina's appeal against the $1.5 billion payment to hedge funds was rejected by a London court.
- The ruling is a setback for Javier Milei’s cash-strapped government, which faces multiple legal challenges from former foreign investors.
- In 2013, Argentina changed the way it calculates GDP and argued that it did not need to pay interest on euro-denominated securities tied to GDP growth.
- Palladian Partners, HBK Master Fund, Hirsh Group, and Virtual Emerald International Limited hold about amoents of these securities governed by English law. They brought a case against Argentina in 2019 asking for compensation due to losses.
- The court ruled in favor of the hedge funds in 2023.
- Argentina's economy is currently experiencing severe economic crisis, with high inflation and low foreign exchange reserves. Paying the hedge funds could affect its ability to service other debts and cause harm to the people of Argentina.
- The country has faced several legal challenges from former investors dating back to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's government (2007-2015). Last year, a New York court ruled that Argentina was liable to pay $16 billion to two former shareholders of state energy company YPF.
- Sebastián Maril from Latam Advisors suggests that the ruling is proof that Argentina's legal strategy is not working and recommends negotiating with judgment creditors for a payment timeline in the future.
- It is unlikely that Argentina will be able to pay the full judgment of €1.33 billion plus interest in the short term, as its foreign reserves are hovering around zero.
