马克龙表示乌克兰应该能够使用西方武器打击俄罗斯

**摘要：**
法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）呼吁允许乌克兰使用西方武器攻击俄罗斯的军事目标，成为呼吁取消基辅支持者设定的针对限制的最高级别北约领导人。他区分了从正在发射导弹的军事基地和其他俄罗斯境内目标进行打击之间的不同。乌克兰官员认为，取消这些限制至关重要，因为他们相信这将使他们能够更好地保卫自己免受俄罗斯袭击，特别是在哈尔科夫省。

**有趣的问题：**

1. **问题：允许乌克兰使用西方提供的武器针对俄罗斯境内的军事基地有什么影响？**
   **答案：** 允许乌克兰使用西方提供的武器针对俄罗斯境内的军事基地可能会升级冲突，导致北约和俄罗斯之间发生更广泛的对抗。这种行动也可能导致莫斯科采取报复性措施，正如俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京所暗示的那样。

2. **问题：马克龙如何证明他允许乌克兰针对俄罗斯境内特定军事基地的立场是正当的？**
   **答案：** 马克龙认为，由于俄罗斯已经组织起来以攻击乌克兰领土的方式，因此乌克兰使用西方提供的武器进行回应并不是升级。他认为这种方法使乌克兰能够在不超越国际法下可接受的行动界限的情况下保卫自己。

3. **问题：如果北约成员国决定向乌克兰提供先进的武器，例如远程导弹，可能会有什么潜在后果？**
   **答案：** 如果北约成员国选择向乌克兰提供先进的武器，如远程导弹，可能会严重升级冲突。这种行动可能会挑起俄罗斯对乌克兰和北约成员国的报复性措施。此外，人们担心这种升级可能会导致“严重的后果”，正如俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京所警告的那样。

4. **问题：其他北约成员国如何回应马克龙关于取消使用西方提供的武器针对俄罗斯的限制的呼吁？**
   **答案：** 虽然德国总理奥拉夫·朔尔茨（Olaf Scholz）表示支持乌克兰，称乌克兰有权根据国际法保卫自己并打击俄罗斯的目标，但德国没有向乌克兰提供任何远程导弹。其他北约成员国也对取消使用西方提供的武器针对俄罗斯军事基地的限制持谨慎态度。

5. **问题：乌克兰官员认为由于目前的限制，“手脚被捆绑”地战斗有什么意义？**
   **答案：** “手脚被捆绑地战斗”这一短语强调了乌克兰在保卫自己免受俄罗斯袭击时所感受到的不利地位。通过取消对西方提供的武器的目标限制，乌克兰官员认为他们将能够更好地保卫自己并保护他们的领土免受进一步的侵略。这一论点突出了重新考虑北约成员国对乌克兰防御战略中武器使用限制的紧迫性。

**Summary:**
French President Emmanuel Macron has called for Ukraine to be allowed to use western weapons against military sites in Russia, becoming the most senior Nato leader to ask for targeting restrictions set by Kyiv’s backers to be lifted. He distinguishes between striking military sites from which missiles are being fired and other targets within Russia. Ukrainian officials argue that lifting these restrictions is crucial as they believe it would allow them to better defend themselves against Russian attacks, particularly in the Kharkiv province.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. **Q: What implications could arise from allowing Ukraine to target military sites within Russia using western-supplied weapons?**  
A: Allowing Ukraine to target military sites within Russia with western-supplied weapons may escalate the conflict, potentially leading to a broader confrontation between NATO and Russia. This action might also result in retaliatory measures from Moscow, as suggested by Russian President Vladimir Putin'amoeba.
2. **Q: How does Macron justify his stance on allowing Ukraine to target specific military sites within Russia?**  
A: Macron justifies his position by arguing that since Russia is already organizing itself in a manner that involves attacking Ukrainian territory, it would not be an escalation for Ukraine to respond with western-supplied weapons. He believes this approach allows Ukraine to defend itself without overstepping the line of acceptable action under international law.
3. **Q: What are some potential consequences if NATO members decide to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry, such as long-range missiles?**  
A: If NATO members choose to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry like long-range missiles, it could lead to a significant escalation of the conflict. This action might provoke Russia into taking retaliatory measures against both Ukraine and NATO member states. Additionally, there is concern that such an escalation may result in "serious consequences," as warned by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
4. **Q: How have other NATO members responded to Macron's call for lifting restrictions on the use of western-supplied weapons against Russia?**  
A: While German Chancellor Olaf Scholz signaled support for Ukraine, stating that it has every right under international law to defend itself and hit targets in Russia if necessary, Germany has not supplied Ukraine with any long-range missiles. Other NATO members have also been cautious about lifting restrictions on the use of western-supplied weapons against Russian military sites.
5. **Q: What is the significance of Ukrainian officials' argument that they are fighting "with one arm tied behind their back" due to current restrictions?**  
A: The phrase "fighting with one arm tied behind their back" emphasizes the perceived disadvantage Ukraine faces in defending itself against Russian attacks. By lifting targeting restrictions on western-supplied weapons, Ukrainian officials argue that they would be better equipped to defend themselves and protect their territory from further aggression. This argument highlights the urgency of reconsiderating current limitations imposed by NATO members on weapon usage in Ukraine's defense strategy.
