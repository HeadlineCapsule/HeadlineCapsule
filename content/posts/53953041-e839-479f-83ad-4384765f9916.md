分裂美国太阳能行业的贸易争端

这个案件是 Hanwha 和 First Solar 主导的请愿者企图扼杀美国竞争对手的行为。它使美国的太阳能组件制造商相互对立，并危及美国的太阳能制造业**就业**和投资。”总部设在美国的加拿大太阳能公司副总裁安德鲁·威廉姆斯（Andrew Williams）说道。该公司在得克萨斯州经营一家电池板工厂，并计划于 2025 年耗资 8 亿美元在印第安纳州开设一家电池厂。

"令人担忧的是，我们未能执行自己的法律，任由中国控制太阳能供应链，扼杀对部署至关重要的美国制造业，"布莱特比尔在向《能源源头》提供的一份声明中说。

This case is an attempt by petitioners, led by Hanwha and First Solar to stifle US competition. It pits American solar manufacturer against American solar manufacturer and puts American solar manufacturing jobs and investment at risk," said Andrew Williams, vice-president at Canadian Solar, which operates a panel factory in Texas and plans to open an $800mn cell factory in Indiana in 2025.
"What is concerning is that we have failed to enforce our own laws, allowing China to control the solar supply chain and shut down US manufacturing, which is critical to deployment," Brightbill said in a statement to Energy Source.
