# 新医疗技术已然到来，但何时能走进您的诊所？

**生物学**、**数据科学**和**社会学**的融合，在**人工智能（AI）**的辅助下，正引领医学领域创新疗法发展。这种综合发展正创造一个 "新一代工具"，其意义可能与抗生素的发现不相上下。英国医学科学院院长安德鲁·莫里斯强调了维持体系信任的重要性，并将之与国际金融转账系统Swift相比较。

然而，医学界采用新技术一向缓慢，例如，人类基因组草图虽曾引发广泛兴奋，但实际对诊所的影响却有限。疫情加速了RNA疫苗和Covid检测等部分技术的应用，但其他进步，如**基因组学**，仍待全面融入日常医疗保健。

**达维德·温科夫**，杜伦大学生物科学教授，他指出了"循证研究"的必要性，以及解释**基因组测序**数据以用于患者治疗的挑战。他以高血压为例，强调了可测量、可治疗和可理解病症的重要性。

**神经技术**，如**脑机接口（BCI）**，是一个缓慢但稳步发展的未来领域。尽管最初的成功吸引了世界的关注，但研究人员有意放慢步伐，专注于对少数志愿者进行密集监测。脑机接口先驱莱·霍奇伯格估计，目前全球仅50名志愿者接受过长期脑机接口植入，但他预测，成功临床试验和更广泛的应用指日可待。

# New medical technologies are here. But when will they reach your GP? 

**The fusion of** **biology**, **data science**, and **sociology**, aided by **artificial intelligence (AI)**, is revolutionizing the field of medicine with a pipeline of innovative treatments. This synthesis is creating a "generation of new tools" that could mark an inflection point in medicine, comparable to the discovery of antibiotics. Andrew Morris, president of the UK Academy of Medical Sciences, emphasizes the importance of maintaining trust in the system, drawing parallels with the international financial transfer system, Swift. 

However, the adoption of new technologies in medicine has historically been slow, as exemplified by the gap between the excitement around the first draft of the human genome and its actual impact in clinics. The pandemic has accelerated the use of some technologies, such as RNA vaccines and Covid tests, but other advancements, like **genomics**, have yet to be fully integrated into routine healthcare. 

**David Weinkove**, bioscience professor at Durham University, highlights the need for "evidence-based research" and the challenge of interpreting **genome sequencing** data for patient treatment. He emphasizes the importance of measurable, treatable, and understandable conditions, using high blood pressure as an example. 

**Neurotechnology**, such as **brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)**, is a futuristic field that has been developing slowly but steadily since the early 2000s. While initial successes captured the world's attention, researchers have deliberately progressed slowly, focusing on intensive monitoring of a small number of volunteers. Leigh Hochberg, a pioneer in BCI, estimates that only 50 volunteers worldwide have received long-term BCI implants to date but predicts that successful clinical trials and wider availability are just a few years away.
