马克·鲁特向维克多·奥班提供交易，因为他寻求担任北约最高职务

**荷兰首相马克·鲁特向匈牙利总理维克多·奥班提供交易**

荷兰首相**马克·鲁特**向**匈牙利总理维克多·奥班**提议了一笔交易，试图确保他在任命鲁特为下任北约秘书长方面的支持。在32个成员国中的29个国家（包括美国、英国、法国和德国等大国）的支持下，荷兰首相面临着奥班的反对，他是联盟中的亲俄领导人。

为了获得匈牙利对任命他的批准，鲁特承诺，在他的任期内，如果北约支持乌克兰的活动发生在成员领土之外，匈牙利将有选择退出这些活动的选择权。这一让步旨在解决奥班对西方支持乌克兰的担忧，因为俄罗斯正在发动全面入侵。

两位领导人在布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟领导人晚宴期间举行了会谈，鲁特确认他将写信给奥班，详细说明他们的讨论要点。虽然荷兰首相没有为过去在峰会上关于奥班的言论道歉，但他们同意专注于北约内的未来合作。

鲁特作为秘书长的任命仍需要联盟所有32个成员国的统一支持。匈牙利是与斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚一起持反对意见的国家之一。然而，随着这一新协议的达成，人们希望奥班将取消对鲁特任命的阻碍。

荷兰首相还保证，海牙的新政府将在欧洲和北约的外交政策中继续支持乌克兰。

 **Summary of Article: Dutch PM Mark Rutte Offers Deal to Hungarian Counterpart Viktor Orbán**

Dutch Prime Minister **Mark Rutte** has proposed a deal to **Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán** in an attempt to secure his support for Rutte's appointment as the next secretary-general of NATO. The Dutch PM, who is backed by 29 out of 32 member countries including major powers like the US, UK, France, and Germany, has faced opposition from Orbán, a pro-Russia leader within the alliance.

In order to gain Hungary's approval for his appointment, Rutte promised that under his tenure as secretary-general, Hungary would have an opt-out option for NATO activities supporting Ukraine if they occur outside of its member territories. This concession aims to address Orbán's concerns about western support for Ukraine amid Russia'cuffs full-scale invasion.

The two leaders held talks during an EU leaders’ dinner in Brussels, and Rutte confirmed that he would write to Orbán detailing their discussion points. Although the Dutch PM did not apologize for past remarks about Orbán at previous summits, they agreed to focus on future cooperation within NATO.

Rutte's appointment as secretary-general still requires unanimous support from all 32 member countries of the alliance. Hungary is one of the remaining holdouts alongside Slovakia and Romania. However, with this new deal in place, there are hopes that Orbán will lift his block on Rutte's appointment.

The Dutch PM also reassured that the planned new government in The Hague would continue to support Ukraine when it comes to foreign policy within Europe and NATO.
