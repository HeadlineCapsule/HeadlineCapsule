# 工党在疲惫的党务人员对休假限制表示不满后放宽了假期限制

**工党** **工作人员** 表示，该党领导层决定放宽对休假的限制，他们对此感到宽慰。这一转变表明，该党并不预计英国首相 **里希·苏纳克** 在 **议会夏季休会期** 之前会宣布 **大选** 。此举是在本月初 **地方选举竞选** 期间，工作人员抱怨由于休假受限而精疲力竭后做出的。

**工党最初对休假的限制** 是在预期可能会提前举行大选的情况下实施的，这一点在去年 **12 月发给工作人员的备忘录** 中有所暗示。然而，随着最新的更新，员工不再限于 **最低限度的假期** ，可以享受超过 **连续两天的假期** 。尽管该党放松了立场，但工作人员仍需做好在短时间内应对 **选举竞选** 的准备。

这一进展反映出该党的评估认为在 **7 月之前** 举行大选的可能性不大，这与 **保守党** 的做法形成对比，保守党并未实施类似的休假限制。下一次选举的时间仍由苏纳克决定，他表示倾向于在今年下半年举行选举，这是一种 "工作假设"。

# Labour loosens holiday limit after tired party staff members balk at curbs

Labour **staff members** are expressing relief as the party leadership has decided to **loosen restrictions** on taking holidays. This shift indicates that the party does not anticipate a **general election** to be called by UK Prime Minister **Rishi Sunak** before **parliament's summer recess**. The decision comes after **staffer complaints** about exhaustion due to restricted leave during the **local election campaign** earlier this month. 

**Labour's initial restrictions** on leave were implemented in anticipation of a potential surprise early election, as indicated in a **December memo** to staff. However, with the latest update, employees are no longer limited to a **minimum amount of holiday** and can take more than **two consecutive days off**. While the party has relaxed its stance, staff have been cautioned to remain prepared for the possibility of **short-notice election campaigning**. 

This development reflects the party's assessment that an election before **July** is improbable, contrasting the approach of the **Conservative Party**, which has not implemented similar holiday restrictions. The timing of the next election remains at Sunak's discretion, with his stated "working assumption" favoring the second half of the year.
