埃文·杰尔斯科维奇因间谍罪在俄罗斯受审

《华尔街日报》记者埃文·杰尔斯科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）因间谍罪在俄罗斯面临审判，与此同时，美国正努力通过囚犯交换来争取他的释放。俄罗斯总检察长办公室在他于叶卡捷琳堡被捕一年多后对他提起诉讼。杰尔斯科维奇被关押在莫斯科的列福尔托夫监狱，该监狱由俄罗斯安全局 FSB 管理。

审判很可能秘密进行，间谍罪最高可判处 20 年监禁。检察官声称他受 CIA 的指派采取了“谨慎的秘密行动”，但没有公开提供他的有罪证据。美国和《华尔街日报》都表示这些指控是毫无根据的。

美国官员正试图通过交换被西方关押的俄罗斯囚犯来确保杰尔斯科维奇获释，例如保罗·惠兰（Paul Whelan）和瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫（Vadim Krasikov）。然而，由于各种复杂情况，迄今为止这些努力均未成功。俄罗斯之前曾因定罪和判刑而与知名美国公民进行过囚犯交换。

关键点：
- 《华尔街日报》记者埃文·杰尔斯科维奇在俄罗斯面临间谍罪指控
- 秘密审判可能导致最高 20 年监禁
- 指控基于涉嫌的 CIA 任务；美国和《华尔街日报》否认有罪
- 美国寻求与俄罗斯进行囚犯交换，涉及保罗·惠兰和瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫
- 俄罗斯之前曾与西方进行过囚犯交换

 **Summary:**
Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, is to be tried on espionage charges in Russia amidst efforts by the United States for his release through prisoner exchange. The Russian prosecutor-general's office filed an indictment against him more than a year after his arrest in Ekaterinburg. Gershkovich has been held at Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, run by Russia's FSB security service.

The trial is likely to be conducted secretly and could result in up to 20 years of imprisonment for espionage charges. Prosecutors claim that he used "careful measures of clandestine activity" on an assignment from the CIA, but have not provided evidence of his guilt publicly. The US and WSJ maintain that the charges are baseless.

US officials are attempting to secure Gershkovich's release in exchange for Russian prisoners held in the West, such as Paul Whelan and Vadim Krasikov. However, efforts have been unsuccessful so far due to various complications. Russia has previously engaged in prisoner swaps with prominent US citizens after conviction and sentencing.

**Key Points:**
- Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich faces espionage charges in Russia
- Secret trial likely, up to 20 years imprisonment for espionage
- Charges based on alleged CIA assignment; US and WSJ deny guilt
- US seeks prisoner exchange with Russia involving Paul Whelan and Vadim Krasikov
- Previous instances of Russian prisoner swaps with the West
