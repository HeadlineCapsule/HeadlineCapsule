绿色和平组织称，工党应打破财政规则以资助能源转型。

## 摘要： 

**绿色和平英国分部** 敦促工党打破财政规则，大规模举债以支持绿色增长，并批评工党的石油和天然气许可立场是“虚伪”的。影子财政大臣 Rachel Reeves 承诺会迎合里希·苏纳克的目标，减少国债，但绿色和平组织建议打破这些规则可以重振经济。工党计划通过对石油和天然气行业征税来投资于一家清洁能源公司，同时支持工人从化石燃料行业转型。

工党誓言不会授予北海新许可证；然而，他们将遵守现有的许可证。如果英国想要达到气候目标，绿色和平组织认为这是一种虚伪的行为。该组织还威胁要对工党关于 Rosebank 石油和天然气田开发的决定采取法律行动。


## 值得关注的问题： 

**Q1:** 根据绿色和平组织的说法，打破财政规则如何潜在地影响经济?
**A1:** 根据 Greenpeace UK 的 Areeba Hamid 表示，打破财政规则可以使工党有更多的资金投资于绿色增长计划，支持工人从化石燃料行业转型。这种增加的开支将通过创造就业机会和促进可持续能源来源来帮助重振疲软的经济。

**Q2:** 围绕工党的石油和天然气许可立场存在什么争议?
**A2:** 工党决定不再颁发新的北海化石燃料勘探许可证，但会尊重现有的许可证，对此，绿色和平英国分部认为这是“虚伪”的。他们认为，如果该党认真对待气候目标，也应该重新考虑开发 Rosebank 石油和天然气田。

**Q3:** 面对潜在的工党政府关于化石燃料开发的决定，绿色和平组织将如何应对?
**A3：** 如果工党政府继续开发 Rosebank 石油和天然气田，绿色和平英国分部计划采取法律行动，声称这一决定不符合减少温室气体排放的国家目标。他们还筹集资金，为抵御壳牌等化石燃料公司发起的诉讼做好准备。

## Summary:
In the article, **Greenpeace UK** urges the Labour Party to break fiscal rules for borrowing on a large scale to support green growth and criticizes their stance as "hypocritical" regarding oil and gas licenses. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged to match Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's target of reducing national debt, but Greenpeace suggests breaking these rules could revitalize the economy. Labour plans to invest in a clean power company funded by taxing oil and gas sectors while supporting workers transition from fossil fuels.

Labour has vowed not to grant new licenses for North Sea exploration; however, they will honor existing ones. Greenpeace argues that this is hypocritical if the UK aims to meet climate targets. The organization also threatens legal action against Labour's decision on Rosebank oil and gas field development.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How does breaking fiscal rules potentially impact the economy, according to Greenpeace?
A1: According to Areeba Hamid from Greenpeace UK, breaking fiscal rules could allow Labour to invest more in green growth initiatives and support workers transitioning away from fossil fuels. This increased spending would help revitalize a sluggish economy by creating jobs and promoting sustainable energy sources.

Q2: What is the controversy surrounding Labour's stance on oil and gas licenses?
A2: The controversy lies in Labour's decision to not grant new North Sea fossil fuel exploration licenses but still honor existing ones, which Greenpeace UK considers "hypocritical." They argue that if the party is serious about meeting climate targets, it should also reconsider developing the Rosebank oil and gas field.

Q3: How does Greenpeace plan to respond to a potential Labour government's decisions on fossil fuel development?
A3: If a Labour government proceeds with the development of the Rosebank oil and gas field, Greenpeace UK plans to take legal action against it, claiming that such a decision is incompatible with national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They have also raised funds to defend themselves against lawsuits from fossil fuel companies like Shell.
