# 苏纳克的最新重新竞选活动是愚蠢的

英国首相里希·苏纳克（**Rishi Sunak**）重新打造了自己的形象，成为“**安全先生**”，强调**国家安全**以及他驾驭一个“艰难和危险的世界”的能力。 这一策略针对的是现在举棋不定的 **2019 年保守党选民**、考虑改革或弃权的选民。保守党策略已从赢得选举转向保住尽可能多的席位，有多达 200 个选区被认为脆弱。苏纳克的消息可能不会得到大多数选民的共鸣，因为他的支持率处于创纪录的低点，但它旨在团结保守党的基本盘。这篇文章还涉及工资增长、寻找英国科技巨头、国际学生入学人数因签证限制而下降，以及政府对无家可归者和提前释放高危罪犯的“严厉”措施的逆转。

# Sunak’s latest relaunch is daft

Rishi Sunak, the UK Prime Minister, has rebranded himself as **Mr. Security**, emphasizing national security and his ability to navigate a "tough and dangerous world." This strategy targets **Conservative voters** from 2019 who are now undecided, considering Reform, or abstaining. The Conservative Party's strategy has shifted from winning the election to saving as many seats as possible, with up to 200 constituencies considered vulnerable. Sunak's message may not resonate with most voters, as his approval rating is at a record low, but it aims to reunite the Conservative base. The article also touches on wage growth, the hunt for a British tech giant, declining international student enrollment due to visa restrictions, and the government's reversal on "draconian" measures for the homeless and early release of high-risk offenders.
