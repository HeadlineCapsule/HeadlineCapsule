# 新签证规则迫使汇丰银行和德勤撤回在英国的**工作邀约**

**汇丰银行**和**德勤**撤回了在英国向**外国毕业生**发出的工作邀约，原因是英国政府最近实施了更严格的**签证规则**，包括提高了**技术工人签证**的**薪资门槛**。这一决定影响了数十名即将到职的员工，尤其是汇丰银行在谢菲尔德的“数字创新”毕业生项目，以及德勤秋季入职的约35人。英国政府此举旨在降低合法移民水平，但这让企业措手不及，也让毕业生感到失望，其中一些人花了大笔钱在英国接受教育。**移民咨询委员会**警告政府不要废除毕业生签证计划，该计划是允许海外学生毕业后在英国工作的一项单独计划。这个问题是选民关注的一个重要问题，而保守党政府已经面临着充满挑战的选举前景。

# New visa rules force HSBC and Deloitte to withdraw UK job offers

**HSBC** and **Deloitte** have withdrawn job offers from **foreign graduates** in the UK due to the government's recent implementation of stricter **visa rules**, which include higher **salary thresholds** for skilled worker visas. This decision has affected dozens of incoming staff, particularly in HSBC's "digital innovation" graduate program in Sheffield and about 35 people in Deloitte's autumn intake. The government's move aims to reduce legal migration levels, but it has left companies scrambling and graduates disappointed, some of whom spent significant amounts on UK education. The **Migration Advisory Committee** has warned the government against abolishing the graduate visa program, a separate scheme allowing overseas students to work in the UK post-graduation. This issue is a significant concern for voters, and the conservative government is already facing a challenging electoral landscape.
