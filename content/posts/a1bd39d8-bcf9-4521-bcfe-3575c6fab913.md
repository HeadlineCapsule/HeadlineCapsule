## 为什么中国不愿意做出急需的变革 

**中国的政治和经济政策都不容易改变**，该国领导人倾向于**将重点放在工业支持上，而不是消费者赋权**。虽然有积极的迹象，例如出口增加支撑了经济增长，但更广泛的政策问题依然存在。尽管试图稳定房地产行业，中国仍未通过财政转移或改善公共服务和社会保障来增强消费者的能力。相反，他们加倍地强调 **供应侧支持**，这可能会导致产能过剩和全球贸易紧张局势。这种不愿意改变现状既受到政治因素的影响，也受到地缘政治因素的影响。执政的共产党希望避免1989年由于通货膨胀而引发起义事件重演，他们的列宁主义核心价值观优先考虑将资源调动起来以实现社会经济转型，而不是个人消费。中国的领导人认为**消费者驱动资本主义**会导致去工业化和其他问题，如民粹主义的兴起。因此，他们倾向于将刺激措施投入制造业部门，该部门在中国被认为是“实体经济”的代名词。这种自给自足的重点是毛泽东思想的遗留影响，而他的继任者放松了这一立场，但这更多出于必要性而不是意识形态上的转变。北京不愿意接受消费者赋权可能会在国内和国际上造成不利后果，但它仍坚持其工业支持战略，凸显出中国投资者面临的独特挑战。

# Why China is reluctant to make a much-needed shift 

**China's political and economic policies are resistant to change**, with the country's leaders preferring to **focus on industrial support over consumer empowerment**. While there have been positive signs, such as an increase in exports supporting economic growth, a broader structural issue remains. Despite attempts to stabilize the property sector, China has failed to empower consumers through fiscal transfers or improved public services and social safety nets. Instead, they've doubled down on **supply-side support**, which may lead to overcapacity and global trade tensions. This resistance to change is driven by both political and geopolitical concerns. The ruling Communist Party aims to avoid a repeat of the 1989 uprising caused partly by inflation, and their Leninist core values prioritize mobilizing resources for social-economic transformation rather than individual consumption. China's leaders see **consumer-driven capitalism** as leading to deindustrialization and other issues like populist ferment. As such, they prefer to channel stimulus into manufacturing, a sector synonymous with the "real economy" in China. This focus on self-sufficiency is a legacy of Mao Zedong, and while his successors relaxed this stance, it was out of necessity rather than ideological shift. Beijing's reluctance to embrace consumer empowerment may have negative consequences domestically and internationally, but it remains committed to its industrial support strategy, highlighting the unique challenges facing investors in China.
