特斯拉试图将伊隆·马斯克薪酬诉讼中律师的奖励从52亿美元降至1360万美元

# 特斯拉提出法院文件，建议成功挑战埃隆·马斯克 560 亿美元薪酬的律师仅获得 1360 万美元，而不是要求的 52 亿美元。

## 关键要点：
- 特斯拉声称，挑战马斯克薪酬方案的拟议 52 亿美元律师费相当于“有史以来最高的小时费率”。
- 该公司认为，原始裁决的假定收益是治疗性的或无法量化的，并指出所要求的奖励金额是以前任何法律费用的一倍多。
- 特斯拉在文件中表示，这一非凡的要求违背了特拉华州的判例法，扭曲了基本经济学，并试图规避法院实施的公平性检查。
- 该公司的计算表明，该金额相当于伯克希尔·利托维茨（Bernstein Litowitz）和两家支持性律师事务所每小时 288 美元的费用，这可能会使他们成为特斯拉前三大的股东。
- 在特拉华州，律师通常必须说服法院在案件结案后增加多少价值才能确定他们的费用。
- 特斯拉下周年度股东大会的投票结果仍不确定，可能会影响马斯克与公司的未来关系。

 **Summary:**  
Tesla has filed a court document proposing that lawyers who successfully challenged Elon Musk's $56bn pay package should receive only $13.6mn instead of the requested $5.2bn award. The carmaker argues that this amount is more in line with Delaware legal history and fairness checks imposed by courts, as well as basic economics.

**Key Points:**  
- Tesla claims a proposed $5.2bn lawyer fee for challenging Musk's pay package amounts to "the highest hourly rate in history."
- The company argues that the supposed benefits from the original ruling are therapeutic or unquantifiable and points out that the requested award would be 17 times larger than any previous legal fee.
- Tesla's filing states that this extraordinary request defies established Delaware case law, mangles basic economics, and seeks to evade fairness checks imposed by courts.
- The company also calculates the sum as equivalent to $288,00 per hour for Bernstein Litowitz and two supporting law firms, potentially making them top-three Tesla shareholders.
- In Delaware, lawyers typically have to convince a court of how much value they added after a case is concluded to determine their fee.
- The outcome of the vote at Tesla's annual meeting next week remains uncertain and may impact Musk's future with the company.
