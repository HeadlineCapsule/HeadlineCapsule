调查未发现在FTX破产案中聘用Sullivan＆Cromwell存在“错误”

# FTX破产案：法院指定调查免除苏利文与克伦威尔律师事务所的利益冲突嫌疑 

**摘要：**  
根据法院命令，对FTX破产案的调查证明华尔街律所苏利文与克伦威尔（**S&C**）没有存在损害其重组建议的、需要回避的**利益冲突**。独立审查人罗伯特·克利里（Robert Cleary）未发现任何证据表明 S＆C 在 FTX 破产申请前知晓该交易所的欺诈行为或忽视了警告信号。不过，他建议进一步调查涉及S&C的两笔破产前交易，并指出由于加密消息应用 **Signal** 等原因导致沟通不畅。 

**有趣的问题：**  
**1.Q：克利里的报告如何影响人们对苏利文与克伦威尔律所作为FTX破产案顾问角色的看法？**  
*A: 报告免除了 S&C 大多数的利益冲突和知晓 FTX 欺诈行为的指控。这一发现可能有助于恢复外界对其专业水准和诚信的信心，尽管之前一些账户持有者和法学教授曾提出过指控。然而，建议进一步调查涉及S＆C的两笔破产前交易，这意味着将继续严格审查律所在FTX破产案中的角色，其声誉可能会受到影响*。 

**2.Q：像 Signal 这样的加密消息应用对法律调查有何影响，未来如何应对？**  
*A: 加密消息应用程序的使用给法律调查人员查阅案件所涉方之间完整沟通记录带来挑战。在FTX破产调查中，克利里指出，由于 S&C 的部分律师通过会自动删除信息的 Signal 应用与 FTX 员工保持联系，可能无法获得他们互动的全貌。这一问题凸显了法律从业者在调查期间透明披露通信方法的必要性，未来可能会因此加强对加密消息应用程序的审查或监管*。 

**3.Q：苏利文与克伦威尔律所处理FTX破产案对其在法律界声誉有何影响，尤其是利益冲突方面？**  
*A: 克利里的报告免除了 S&C 在担任 FTX 重组顾问时存在需要回避的利益冲突的大多数嫌疑，但并未完全驳回所有指控。建议进一步调查的两笔涉及S＆C的破产前交易意味着将继续对其角色进行严格审查，声誉可能在法律界受到影响。此外，FTX 前首席执行官约翰·雷（John Ray）指控 S&C 在破产前淡化其与 FTX 的工作关系，这也可能会影响律所的声誉。不过，如果S＆C能够成功应对这些挑战，并在未来案件中表现出透明度，他们仍有可能减轻任何长期的声誉损害*。

**Summary:**  
A court-ordered investigation into FTX's bankruptcy absolved Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C) of disqualifying conflicts of interest that would have undermined its restructuring advice to the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange. The independent examiner, Robert Cleary, found no evidence suggesting S&C knew about fraud at FTX or ignored red flags before the bankruptcy filing. However, he recommended further inquiry into two pre-bankruptcy transactions involving S&C and noted gaps in communication due to encrypted messaging platforms like Signal.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. **Q:** How did Robert Cleary's report impact the perception of Sullivan & Cromwell's role as FTX’s bankruptcy counsel?  
    *A:* The report largely absolved S&C from conflicts of interest and allegations that it knew about fraud at FTX. This finding may help restore confidence in S&C's expertise and integrity, despite previous accusations by some accountholders and law professors. However, the recommendation for further inquiry into two pre-bankruptcy transactions involving S&C leaves room for continued scrutiny of their role as FTX’s bankruptcy counsel.
   
2. **Q:** What are the implications of encrypted messaging platforms like Signal on legal investigations, and how might this affect future cases?  
    *A:* The use of encrypted messaging platforms can create challenges for legal investigators in accessing complete communication records between parties involved in a case. In FTX's bankruptcy investigation, Cleary noted that some S&C lawyers were in touch with FTX employees on Signal, which auto-deletes messages and may not provide the full context of their interactions. This issue highlights the need for legal professionals to be transparent about their communication methods during investigations and could lead to increased scrutiny or regulation of encrypted messaging platforms in future cases.
   
3. **Q:** How might Sullivan & Cromwell's handling of FTX’s bankruptcy affect its reputation within the legal community, particularly regarding conflicts of interest?  
    *A:* While Cleary's report largely absolved S&C from disqualifying conflicts of interest in their role as FTX'cuestructuring counsel, it did not completely dismiss all allegations against them. The recommendation for further inquiry into two pre-bankruptcy transactions involving S&C leaves room for continued scrutiny and potential reputational damage within the legal community. Additionally, accusations by John Ray, FTX's former CEO, that S&C played down its work with FTX before bankruptcy may also impact their reputation. However, if S&C can successfully navigate these challenges and demonstrate transparency in future cases, they may be able to miteigate any long-term reputational damage.
