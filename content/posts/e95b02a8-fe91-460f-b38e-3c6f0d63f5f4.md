拜登的G7外交政策成功希望因加沙战争而受挫

# 拜登总统在G7峰会上的外交政策成功因加沙和乌克兰的挑战而受挫

**摘要：**

拜登总统在G7峰会上展现了美国实力，支持乌克兰对抗俄罗斯军队，但在处理以色列-哈马斯冲突时面临左派的批评。加沙局势复杂化了拜登将自己塑造成一位致力于民主的世界领袖的努力，因为全球威权主义正在崛起。

**要点：**

1. **G7峰会和外交政策成功：** 拜登总统在G7峰会上展示了美国实力，尤其是支持乌克兰对抗俄罗斯军队。他与乌克兰总统泽连斯基签署了为期10年的安全协议，并从G7国家为乌克兰国防获得了500亿美元。

2. **加沙的挑战：** 以色列-哈马斯战争在选民中引发了反弹，他们对巴勒斯坦平民伤亡人数和拜登支持以色列军事行动感到担忧。他的以色列和哈马斯之间的和平计划没有得到多大关注，影响了他的外交政策地位。

3. **与特朗普的比较：** 2021年从阿富汗混乱撤军导致人们对拜登处理外交政策的能力的民意调查下降。批评者认为，自特朗普离职以来，世界变得更加危险和不稳定，而支持者则强调特朗普与美国盟友之间的紧张关系以及他对威权主义领导人的钦佩。

4. **对2024年选举的影响：** 特朗普在即将到来的选举中击败拜登的前景受到外交政策问题的影响，人们担心美国将在11月大选中展现出何种面貌——是拥抱民主，还是倾向于威权主义。

 **Summary:**  
President Biden's foreign policy success at the G7 summit was undermined by challenges in Gaza and Ukraine. While he demonstrated decisive leadership in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression, his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict has faced criticism from voters on the left. The situation in Gaza complicates Biden's efforts to project himself as a world leader devoted to democracy amidst rising authoritarianism.

**Key Points:**  
1. **G7 Summit and Foreign Policy Successes:** President Biden aimed to showcase American power at the G7 summit, particularly in supporting Ukraine against Russian forces. He signed a 10-year security pact with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and secured $50bn from G7 countries for Ukraine's defense.
2. **Challenges in Gaza:** The Israel-Hamas war has triggered backlash among some voters, who are concerned about the level of Palestinian civilian casualties and Biden's support for Israel's military campaign. His peace plan between Israel and Hamas gained little traction, affecting his foreign policy standing.
3. **Comparison with Trump:** The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 contributed to a decline in polling on Biden's handling of foreign policy. Critics argue that the world has become more dangerous and unstable since Trump left office, while supporters highlight tensions between Trump and US allies as well as his admiration for authoritarian leaders.
4. **Impact on 2024 Election:** The prospect of a Trump victory over Biden in the upcoming election is influenced by foreign policy issues, with concerns about which version of America will show up at the polls this November – one that embraces democracy or one drawn to authoritarianism.

Recommended  
Biden's plea for Americans to fight for US democracy after D-Day commemorations indirectly targeted Trump, emphasizing the importance of defending democracy and standing up against aggression both at home and abroad.
