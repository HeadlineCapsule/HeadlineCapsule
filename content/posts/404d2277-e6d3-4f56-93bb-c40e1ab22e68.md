分析师警告：美国借贷狂潮或将引发市场动荡

# 分析师警告美国借贷狂潮可能导致市场紧张

由于向乌克兰和以色列提供一揽子援助计划，美国面临着预算赤字大幅增加。国会预算办公室预测，美国本财政年度的赤字将达到 1.9 万亿美元，高于其 2 月预测的 1.9 万亿美元。这种借贷狂潮可能会迫使美联储提前结束量化紧缩，从而扰乱货币市场，并使抗击通货膨胀的努力复杂化。

分析师警告说，美国将需要通过短期债务工具（如国库券）来资助这一赤字。到今年年底，这些国库券的未偿还总存量预计将达到创纪录的 6.2 万亿美元，高于 2023 年底的 5.7 万亿美元。这种转向短期融资可能会给资金市场带来压力，并引发人们对谁会购买这些国库券的担忧。

在过去的 15 年里，美国财政部一直增加对债务融资的依赖，自金融危机以来，财政部市场的规模已增长了五倍。然而，随着一些到期日较长的国库券拍卖的需求达到创纪录的规模，分析师们担心谁会购买所有提供的债务。

美联储退出市场可能会危及量化紧缩工作，并可能导致 2019 年 9 月回购危机的重演，当时隔夜贷款利率短暂飙升超过 10%。分析师警告说，如果美国向市场倾泻国库券，可能会迫使提前结束量化紧缩。

 **Article Summary:**
US Borrowing Binge Risks Market Strains, Analysts Warn

The United States is facing a significant increase in its budget deficit due to aid packages for Ukraine and Israel. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the US deficit will rise to $1.9tn this fiscal year, up from their February prediction of $1.ninety billion. This borrowing binge may force the Federal Reserve to end quantitative tightening earlier than planned, potentially disrupting money markets and complicating efforts against inflation.

Analysts warn that the US will need to fund this deficit with short-term debt instruments like Treasury bills. The total outstanding stock of these bills is expected to reach an all-time high of $6.2tn by year's end, up from $5.7tn at the end of 2023. This shift towards short-term financing may strain funding markets and raise concerns about who will buy them.

The US Treasury has been increasing its reliance on debt financing over the past 15 years, with the size of the Treasury market quintupling since the financial crisis. However, as demand for longer-dated Treasury auctions reaches record sizes at some maturities, analysts are concerned about who will buy all the debt on offer.

The Federal Reserve's pullback from the market could jeopardize quantitative tightening efforts and potentially lead to a repeat of the September 2019 repo crisis when overnight lending rates briefly spiked above 10%. Analysts warn that if the US floods the market with Treasury bills, it may force an earlier end to quantitative tightening.
