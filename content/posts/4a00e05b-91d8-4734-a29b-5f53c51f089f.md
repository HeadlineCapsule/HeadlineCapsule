# 英国投资者洽谈收购蒂斯赛德国际机场 49% 股份

**英国投资者**Michael Flacks 正在洽谈收购 **蒂斯赛德国际机场** **49% 的股份**，计划将该机场打造成 **货运、维修和维护中心**。该机场于 **2019 年** 由 **Lord Ben Houchen 收归国有**，但一直处于亏损状态，多次需要 **当地公共部门** 提供资金援助。 Flacks 作为擅长 **企业重组** 的交易撮合者，打算改变机场以乘客航班为主的经营方向，对该交易的估值与当地政府五年前支付的价格相同： **4000 万英镑**。他强调这笔交易具有重大长期投资潜力，目标是通过探索新方向，使机场实现盈利。拟议交易将授予 Flacks **运营控制权**，而 **当地议会** 将保持静默合伙人身份。 Flacks 还强调了他最近收购的附近的可用于 **可再生能源生产** 和 **电池存储** 投资的场地。该机场对该地区具有政治意义，尽管其他公司也有兴趣，但当地官员打算让机场保持公共所有制。

# British investor in talks to buy 49% share in Teesside International Airport

Michael Flacks, a **British investor**, is in negotiations to acquire a **49% stake** in **Teesside International Airport**, with plans to transform it into a **cargo, repair, and maintenance hub**. The airport, nationalized in **2019** by **Lord Ben Houchen**, has continued to incur losses, requiring multiple bailouts from the **local public sector**. Flacks, a dealmaker specializing in **corporate turnarounds**, intends to shift the airport's focus away from passenger flights, valuing the deal at the same price paid by the local government five years ago: **£40 million**. He emphasizes the potential for significant long-term investment, with a goal of making the airport profitable by exploring new directions. The proposed deal would grant Flacks **operational control**, while the **local councils** would remain as silent partners. Flacks also highlights his recent acquisition of a nearby site for investments in **renewable energy production** and **battery storage**. The airport holds political significance for the region, and while there has been interest from other firms, local officials intend to keep the airport under public ownership.
