# 社会动荡影响员工，企业调整以适应 

**社会动荡**，包括 **2019冠状病毒病大流行和乔治·弗洛伊德在2020年被谋杀后的抗议活动**，促使公司重新评估其对员工健康的态度。美国一家总部设在明尼阿波利斯附近的数据安全公司 Entrust 看到其员工的心理健康索赔和绩效投诉激增，这驱使其加强了 **健康计划**。他们推出了诸如与心理健康教练的一对一会谈、冥想研讨会和社会活动等服务。这种转变突显出人们越来越认识到外部事件对雇员福祉的影响。

根据就业法律事务所 Littler 的一项调查，去年员工因心理健康问题而请求休假或调整工作安排的数量增加了 **74%**。因此，公司正转向实施广泛的企业健康计划；去年美国 80% 的员工人数超过 200 人的企业提供了此类项目。这些举措涵盖了各种福利，如体重管理门诊和生物识别筛查，但最初是出于企业医疗保健费用的节省考虑提出的。 

然而，批评人士认为，一些工人可能更倾向于灵活的工作安排或现金奖金，而不是这些健康方面的额外待遇。尽管如此，支持者仍然强调其对留住员工、减少保险索赔和病假方面带来的积极影响。Entrust 在推行该计划过程中就遇到了这种分歧；由于利用率低，他们取消了初步提供的短期咨询和现场健身房等服务，而侧重于睡眠和营养的活动则得到了员工的高度参与和积极反馈，这凸显出根据员工需求量身定制此类计划的至关重要性。 

这种转向关注雇员健康的转变表明人们越来越认识到 **心理健康** 支持对维持一支能够应对社会动荡带来的挑战的健康劳动力至关重要。

# Companies adjust as social upheaval takes its toll on workers 

**Social unrest**, including the **COVID-19 pandemic and protests following George Floyd's murder in 2020**, has prompted companies to reevaluate their approach to employee wellness. Entrust, a US data security company based near Minneapolis, witnessed a surge in mental health claims and performance complaints from its workers, driving them to enhance their **wellness programmes**. They introduced offerings such as one-on-one sessions with mental health coaches, meditation seminars, and social activities. This shift underscores the growing recognition of the impact of external events on employee well-being.

As per a survey by employment law firm Littler, there has been a **74% increase** in staff requests for leaves or accommodations related to mental health issues over the past year. Consequently, companies are turning to expansive corporate wellness initiatives as solutions; 80% of US businesses with over 200 employees provided such programs last year. These initiatives cover various benefits like weight management clinics and biometric screenings but initially stemmed from a cost-saving perspective for businesses regarding healthcare costs. 

However, critics argue that flexible work arrangements or cash bonuses might be preferred by some workers instead of these wellness perks. Still, supporters tout the positive impact on employee retention rates and reduced insurance claims and sick days. Entrust's own journey with their program highlights this divide; while initial offerings like short-term counseling and onsite gyms were scrapped due to low uptake, initiatives focused on sleep and nutrition saw high engagement and positive feedback from employees, underscoring the importance of tailoring such programs to employee needs. 

This shift in focus towards employee wellness is indicative of a broader recognition that **mental health** support is critical for maintaining a healthy workforce capable of withstanding social upheaval's challenges.
