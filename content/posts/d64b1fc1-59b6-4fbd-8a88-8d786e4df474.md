# 在拜登任期内大赚的石油巨头为何讨厌他？

尽管美国总统乔·拜登任期内美国 **石油和天然气** 行业利润和产量创下纪录，但该行业生产商却颇感不满，并资助特朗普的竞选活动。该行业认为拜登对 **气候变化** 和环境监管的关注是对自己的威胁，有些人甚至声称这将导致行业的毁灭。这种看法使得拜登在米德兰（Texas）等产油地区颇不受欢迎。

然而，总统对 **石油生产** 的影响力有限，华盛顿控制之外的市场力量发挥着更重要的作用。尽管拜登实施了针对该行业的政策，但也同时要求增加生产，以应对 **汽油价格** 上涨并支持欧洲减少对俄罗斯天然气的依赖。

该行业反对拜登的原因是担心他在潜在的第二任期内会造成长期损害，并担忧资本外逃和生产减少。这导致该行业及其支持者发起了一场资金充足的运动，以推动 **石油天然气开发** 并反对拜登的气候政策。这一争议凸显了能源政策、经济利益和环境问题之间的复杂相互作用，尽管担心特朗普潜在的关税战争及其政策不可预测，该行业仍资助特朗普的竞选活动。

# Big Oil boomed under Biden. So why does it hate him?

Despite record-breaking profits and production levels in the US **oil and gas** industry during President Joe Biden's term, there is significant discontent among producers, who are funding Trump's campaign. The industry perceives Biden's focus on **climate change** and environmental regulations as a threat, with some claiming it will lead to the sector's ruin. This perception has made Biden unpopular in oil-producing regions like Midland, Texas. 

However, the ability of the president to influence **oil production** is limited, and market forces beyond Washington's control play a more significant role. While Biden has implemented policies targeting the industry, these have coexisted with requests for increased production to counter high **petrol prices** and support Europe in reducing its reliance on Russian gas. 

The industry's opposition to Biden is driven by fears of long-term damage under a potential second term, with concerns about capital flight and reduced production. This has led to a well-funded campaign by the industry and its supporters to promote increased **oil and gas development** and oppose Biden's climate policies. The dispute highlights the complex interplay between energy policy, economic interests, and environmental concerns, with the industry funding Trump's campaign despite concerns about his potential tariff wars and the unpredictability of his policies.
