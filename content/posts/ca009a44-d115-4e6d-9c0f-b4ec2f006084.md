# **OpenAI**联合创始人兼首席科学家**Ilya Sutskever**离职

**OpenAI** 的 **联合创始人** 和 **首席科学家** Ilya Sutskever 已离开公司，这位 **人工智能（AI）** 领域的杰出人物的离职标志着一个重大的变化。这次离职发生在一次失败的政变企图之后六个月，当时 Sutskever 与其他人试图罢免 CEO Sam Altman。这家总部位于旧金山的初创公司估值超过800亿美元，一直处于**生成AI**领域的前沿，而 Sutskever 在其早期主导地位中发挥了关键作用。他的离职，以及与他密切合作研究“对齐”的高级研究员 Jan Leike 的离职，引发了人们对该公司以及该领域未来方向的疑问。Sutskever 的缺席在 OpenAI 最近的更新中非常明显，他的门生 Jakub Pachocki 现在将担任首席科学家。随着 Sutskever 暗示新的项目，他的离职将对 OpenAI 和更广泛的 AI 社区产生何种影响仍有待观察。

# OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever departs

Ilya Sutskever, a **co-founder** and **chief scientist** of OpenAI, has left the company, marking a significant change for the prominent figure in the field of **artificial intelligence (AI)**. This exit comes six months after a failed coup attempt where Sutskever and others sought to oust CEO Sam Altman. The San Francisco-based start-up, valued at over $80 billion, has been at the forefront of **generative AI**, with Sutskever playing a key role in its early dominance. His departure, along with that of senior researcher Jan Leike, who worked closely with Sutskever on "alignment," raises questions about the future direction of the company and the field. Sutskever's absence was notable during OpenAI's recent updates, and his mentee, Jakub Pachocki, will now take on the role of chief scientist. As Sutskever hints at new projects, the impact of his departure on OpenAI and the wider AI community remains to be seen.
