西班牙旅游业创纪录，赶超法国

## 摘要：
去年，西班牙的国际访问量创历史新高，首次超过8500万人次，成为继法国之后世界上第二受欢迎的旅游目的地。这股**旅游热潮**带来了经济利益，但也引发了一些西班牙人对“**旅游恐惧症**”的担忧，原因包括丑陋的度假村、租金上涨、游客的不良行为和水资源过度使用等问题。对此，地方政府采取了一系列措施来应对这些负面影响，如征收**旅游税**、禁止新建度假房、严格管控 Airbnb 式短租以及减少酒店床位数量等。西班牙工业与贸易部长强调了促进经济、环境和社会可持续发展的“优质”旅游业的重要性。

## 有趣的问题：
1. 去年西班牙国际访问量超过8500万人次有哪些因素贡献?
   回答：西班牙游客数量创纪录是由多个因素共同推动的。首先，该国一直在与法国竞争“世界顶级旅游目的地”的称号。此外，西班牙作为美食胜地和丰富的文化景点也吸引了更多的美食爱好者和文化游客。中东战争也使原本可能前往土耳其、突尼斯和埃及等国家的旅行者转而选择西班牙。

2. 西班牙人的“旅游恐惧症”有何表现?
   回答：**旅游恐惧症**（tourism-phobia）一词用来描述西班牙人对游客的反感，原因包括新建的丑陋度假村、租金飙升、不良行为和水资源过度使用等问题。这种情绪在加那利群岛和巴利阿里群岛等热门旅游目的地尤为强烈，当地居民抗议过度旅游及其对社区造成的负面影响。

3. 地方政府采取了哪些措施来应对“旅游恐惧症”和管理游客流量?
   回答：西班牙地方政府实施了多种措施来减轻过度旅游带来的负面影响，包括征收**旅游税**、禁止新建度假房、严格管控 Airbnb 式短租、减少酒店床位数量等。此外，圣塞瓦斯蒂安等城市还限制了旅行团规模，以缓解人行道拥挤问题；巴塞罗那市长则誓言要消除旧城区内的游客公寓。

## Summary:
Spain achieved a record number of international visitors last year, surpassing 85 million people for the first time and becoming the world's second-most visited country after France. This tourism boom has brought economic benefits but also sparked "tourism-phobia" among some Spaniards due to issues such as unsightly resorts, rising rental prices, bad behavior, and overuse of water resources. In response, local governments have implemented measures like tourism taxes, bans on new holiday accommodations, and strict regulations on Airbnb-style rentals. Spain's Minister of Tourism and Industry emphasized the need for "quality" tourism that is sustainable in economic, environmental, and social terms.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: What factors contributed to Spain surpassing 85 million international visitors last year?
   A: Several factors played a role in Spain's record-breaking number of tourists. Firstly, the country has been actively competing with France for the title of "world's top tourist destination." Additionally, Spain's reputation as a culinary hub and its rich cultural attractions have attracted more foodies and cultural tourists. The war in the Middle East also redirected travelers who might have otherwise visited countries like Turkey, Tunisia, and Egypt.
   
2. Q: How has "tourism-phobia" manifested among some Spaniards?
   A: Tourism-phobia is a term used to describe the backlash against tourists in Spain due to various issues such as unsightly new resorts, soaring rental prices, bad behavior, and overuse of water resources. This sentiment has been particularly strong in hotspots like the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, where residents have protested against excessive tourism and its negative impact on their communities.
   
3. Q: What measures are local governments taking to address "tourism-phobia" and manage the influx of visitors?
   A: Local governments in Spain have implemented various measures to curb the negative effects of excessive tourism, including imposing tourism taxes, banning new holiday accommodations, enforcing strict regulations on Airbnb-style rentals, and reducing the number of tourist beds. Additionally, some cities like San Sebastián have limited the size of tour groups to reduce pavement congestion, while Barcelona's mayor has vowed to eliminate tourist apartments in the old town.
