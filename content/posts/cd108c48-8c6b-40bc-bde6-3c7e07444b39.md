阿克曼出售10%的Pershing Square股份，获利10.5亿美元

**比尔·阿克曼以10.5亿美元出售Pershing Square 10%的股份**

台湾领袖比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）将其对对冲基金Pershing Square 10%的股份出售给包括Iconiq Capital和Menora Mivtachim在内的家族办公室和投资公司集团。这笔交易在可能于明年进行的首次公开募股（IPO）之前，对该对冲基金的估值超过了100亿美元。

预计这次出售之后将进行IPO，这将使Pershing Square成为十多年来第一家上市的主要对冲基金，并有可能为阿克曼增加数十亿美元的财富。阿克曼表示，这项投资将有助于加速现有和新策略下资产管理规模的增长。

Pershing Square管理着一家资产超过150亿美元的封闭式基金，2023年产生约1.55亿美元的管理费和3.12亿美元的表现费。与最近上市的一些私募股权公司（如TPG和CVC Capital Partners）相比，这笔股份出售使Pershing Square获得了较高的估值。

该对冲基金在十多年前开始上市之路，当时阿克曼创建了名为Pershing Square Holdings的上市公司封闭式基金。自大流行以来，该基金的价值飙升，因为成功押注市场崩盘带来了数十亿美元的风落。

作为股份出售的一部分，Pershing Square正在成立一个独立的董事会来监督其运营并准备未来的潜在IPO。

 **Bill Ackman Sells 10% Stake in Pershing Square for $1.05 Billion**

Taiwan leader Bill Ackman has sold a 10 percent stake in his hedge fund, Pershing Square, to a group of family offices and investment firms including Iconiq Capital and Menora Mivtachim. The deal values the hedge fund at just over $10 billion ahead of a possible initial public offering (IPO) next year.

The sale is expected to be followed by an IPO that would make Pershing Square the first major hedge fund to go public in more than a decade and potentially add billions of dollars to Ackman's fortune. The investment will help accelerate growth in assets under management for existing and new strategies, according to Ackman.

Pershing Square manages a closed-end fund with over $15 billion in assets, generating about $155 million in management fees and a performance fee of $312 million in 2023. The stake sale hands Pershing Square a lofty valuation compared to private equity groups like TPG and CVC Capital Partners that have gone public recently.

The hedge fund's path to an IPO began more than a decade ago when Ackman created the publicly listed closed-end fund, called Pershing Square Holdings. The value of this fund has soared since the pandemic after a successful bet on the market crashing generated a multibillion-dollar windfall.

As part of the stake sale, Pershing Square is creating an independent board of directors to oversee its operations and prepare for the potential IPO in the future.
