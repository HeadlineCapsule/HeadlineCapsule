# 巴西环境机构的罢工开始打击经济关键领域 

巴西**环境执法机构**4000 名公职人员发起的**罢工**正导致该国经济受到重大干扰。劳工停工导致对**环境侵权**行为的罚款急剧下降，现在正影响**汽车**、**石油和天然气**以及**电力生产**等关键行业。这次罢工要求提高工资和改善工作条件，正影响着巴西的总体国家增长，并可能对该国的**生物群落**和**森林砍伐**率产生负面影响。

罢工已经持续了五个月，导致进口汽车的积压，等待巴西环境部的行政机构 Ibama 的批准。这影响了全国汽车制造商协会，有 47,000 辆汽车滞留在港口。**石油和天然气行业**也受到影响，由于勘探许可证的减少，税收损失达 10 亿巴西雷亚尔。

数十个电力生产项目被搁置，罢工威胁破坏**路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦**总统促进环境保护和主办 2024 年**联合国 COP30 气候峰会**的努力。环保人士警告说，现场代理人员的缺席可能导致生物群落破坏和森林砍伐增加，逆转 2023 年取得的成就。

随着罢工继续进行，且未达成任何协议，巴西的经济和环境后果正变得越来越严重。

# Strike at Brazil's Environmental Agencies Starts to Hit Key Parts of Economy 

A **strike** by Brazil's **environmental enforcement agencies**, involving 4,000 public servants, is causing significant disruptions to the country's economy. The labor stoppage has resulted in a sharp decline in fines for **environmental infringements** and is now affecting key sectors such as **automotive**, **oil and gas**, and **electricity generation**. The strike, which demands better wages and working conditions, is impacting Brazil's overall national growth and could have negative consequences for the country's **biomes** and **deforestation** rates. 

The strike has been ongoing for five months and has led to a backlog of imported cars awaiting approval from Ibama, the administrative arm of the Ministry of Environment. This has affected the National Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, with 47,000 vehicles stuck in ports. The **oil and gas industry** has also been impacted, with a loss of BRL$1bn in tax revenue due to a decrease in exploration licenses. 

Dozens of electricity generation projects are on hold, and the strike threatens to undermine President **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's** efforts to promote environmental protection and host the **UN COP30 climate summit** in 2024. Environmentalists warn that the absence of field agents could lead to an increase in biome destruction and deforestation, reversing the successes achieved in 2023. 

As the strike continues with no agreement in sight, the economic and environmental consequences for Brazil are becoming increasingly severe.
