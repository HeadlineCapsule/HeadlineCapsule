# 中国消费通胀在经济缓慢复苏中略有上升

中国**消费通胀**在 4 月略有上升，表明经济缓慢但持续复苏。**消费者价格指数（Consumer Price Index）**同比上涨**0.3%**，其中**能源、教育和旅游**成本上升，而**食品价格**下降。这标志着**连续第三个月**出现消费通胀，表明**国内需求稳定**，尽管**房地产市场**举步维艰。消费者支出的改善与习近平主席重振制造业的重点相一致，尤其是在**高科技行业**，以抵消房地产行业的放缓。然而，**生产者价格指数（Producer Price Index）**继续下降，同比下降**2.5%**，表明**制造业价格**仍处于低位，影响着**利润率**。这引发了**西方领导人**对廉价中国进口商品的担忧，**欧盟**和美国已采取措施保护其市场。中国出口产品，尤其是**电动汽车**和**绿色能源**行业的产品，面临着更高的关税和日益紧张的贸易局势。习近平主席驳斥了这些担忧，认为中国的出口在全球通胀背景下是有益的。消费者和工厂通胀趋势的差异凸显了中国经济复苏的复杂性，一方面国内需求呈现出改善迹象，另一方面外部贸易紧张局势依然存在。

# China's consumer inflation edges upward in a slow economic recovery

China's **consumer inflation** rose slightly in April, indicating a slow but steady economic recovery. The **consumer price index** increased by **0.3% year-over-year**, with **energy, education, and tourism** costs rising while **food prices** fell. This marks the **third consecutive month** of consumer inflation, suggesting a **stabilization of domestic demand** despite the struggling **real estate market**. The improvement in consumer spending is aligned with President Xi Jinping's focus on **reviving manufacturing**, especially in **high-tech industries**, to offset the slowdown in the property sector. However, the **producer price index** continued to decline, falling by **-2.5% year-over-year**, indicating that **manufacturing sector prices** remain low, impacting **profit margins**. This has sparked concerns among **Western leaders** about cheap Chinese imports, with the **EU** and the **US** taking steps to protect their markets. Chinese exports, particularly in the **electric vehicle** and **green energy** sectors, are facing increased tariffs and trade tensions. President Xi has dismissed these concerns, arguing that China's exports are beneficial in the context of global inflation. The contrasting trends in consumer and factory inflation highlight the complex nature of China's economic recovery, with domestic demand showing signs of improvement while external trade tensions persist.
