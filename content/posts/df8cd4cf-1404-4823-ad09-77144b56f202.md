# **新兴市场垃圾债券** 在主权债券市场中表现优异 

**新兴市场主权债券**（具有**垃圾评级**）在 2024 年的表现优于其他主权债务市场，包括美国国债，尽管受到了美国高借贷成本的影响。这要归功于**全球经济**的韧性、**大宗商品价格**的上涨，以及**国际货币基金组织**等贷款机构的支持。这些债券为投资者带来的总回报达到 4.9%，而美国国债则损失了 3.3%。

尼日利亚、安哥拉和赞比亚等国受益于大宗商品价格上涨，而国际货币基金组织的支持则为深陷债务困境的斯里兰卡和赞比亚等国提供了帮助。投资者对持有风险较高的新兴市场主权债券所要求的风险溢价一直保持稳定，表明这些市场的基本面正在改善。通常情况下，发达国家更高的债券收益率会对发展中国家产生负面影响，但今年流入新兴市场债务基金的资金流出被流入美国高收益债务基金的资金所抵消。

投资者预计这些趋势将逆转，资本将回流到新兴市场，特别是美国企业的前景如果恶化。阿根廷、斯里兰卡、加纳和赞比亚等国在国内改革和重组谈判方面取得的进展，增强了新兴经济体的韧性。**国际货币基金组织**和其他官方债权人的大力支持也降低了 2024 年主权债务违约的可能性，进一步稳定了市场。

高收益新兴市场国家的强劲表现提振了摩根大通更广泛的外币新兴市场主权债券指数，使其表现优于高评级全球债券指数。尽管预测新兴市场的经济增长会略有放缓，但这种积极的表现预计将持续。然而，由于美元走强以及央行降息能力受限，**当地货币新兴市场债券**表现不佳。

# Emerging market junk bonds are top performers in sovereign debt markets 

**Emerging market sovereign bonds** with **junk ratings** have outperformed other sovereign debt markets in 2024, including US Treasury bonds, despite the impact of high US borrowing costs. This performance is attributed to the resilience of the **global economy**, higher **commodity prices**, and support from lenders like the **IMF**. The total return for investors in these bonds reached 4.9%, while US Treasury bonds saw a loss of 3.3%.

/n/n

Countries like Nigeria, Angola, and Zambia have benefited from higher commodity prices, while support from the IMF has aided those in debt distress, such as Sri Lanka and Zambia. The premium demanded by investors for holding riskier emerging market sovereign bonds has remained stable, indicating improving fundamentals in these markets. Usually, higher bond yields in developed countries negatively impact developing countries, but this year, the outflows from emerging market debt funds have been offset by inflows into US high-yield debt funds.

/n/n

Investors expect these trends to reverse, with capital flowing back into emerging markets, particularly if the outlook for US corporates deteriorates. The progress on domestic reforms and restructuring talks in several countries, such as Argentina, Sri Lanka, Ghana, and Zambia, has contributed to the resilience of emerging economies. Significant support from the IMF and other official creditors has also reduced the likelihood of sovereign debt defaults in 2024, providing further stability to the market.

/n/n

The strong performance of high-yield emerging market countries has lifted JPMorgan's broader foreign currency EM sovereign bond index, outperforming the index of high-grade global bonds. This positive performance is expected to continue, despite forecasts of slightly lower economic growth across emerging markets. However, **local currency EM bonds** have underperformed due to the strength of the US dollar and constraints on central banks' ability to cut interest rates.
