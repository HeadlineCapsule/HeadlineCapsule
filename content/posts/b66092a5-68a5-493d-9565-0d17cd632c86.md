# 英国税务海关总署再次因糟糕的客户服务而受到警告

**英国国会议员和税务专家**呼吁大幅改善**英国税务机关**的客户服务，并增加向**英国税务海关总署（HMRC）**提供的资金，此前**英国国家审计署（NAO）**发布了一份严厉的报告。该报告显示，英国税务海关总署的客户服务处于“下降螺旋”中，纳税人在 2022-23 年度花费了高达 700 万小时的等待时间。这一问题引起了**财政部特选委员会**和**英格兰及威尔士特许会计师协会**的关注，他们也加入了呼吁改善的行列。

这些问题归咎于多种因素，包括资金压力、裁员以及通过鼓励**在线税务管理**以实现**成本削减**。英国国家审计署强调，2019-20 年至 2023-24 年间，客户服务人员减少了 9%，同时自 2019-20 年以来，实际支出削减了 6%。英国税务海关总署被要求进一步节省开支，导致计划在 2024-25 年将客户服务人数减少 14%。

---

尽管英国政府最近承诺追加 5100 万英镑的资金，但专家认为这不足以解决该问题。他们强调，需要为纳税人提供广为宣传和方便获取的建议和支持，尤其是考虑到纳税人数的增加和当前**自动化数字服务**的局限性。呼吁改进还扩展到了英国税务海关总署的数字化服务，这些服务目前不可靠且不足以满足纳税人的需求。

该摘要强调了专家和立法者之间的一种共识，即英国税务海关总署需要更多资源和改进的数字服务，以有效地为纳税人服务并实现其收款目标。

# HMRC Warned Again on Poor Customer Service 

**MPs and tax experts** have called for a significant improvement in the **UK tax authority's** customer service and additional funding for the **HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)**, following a critical report from the **National Audit Office (NAO)**. The NAO's report revealed that HMRC's customer service was in a "declining spiral," with taxpayers spending a staggering 7 million hours on hold in 2022-23. This issue has caught the attention of both the **Treasury select committee** and the **Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales**, who have joined the call for improvements. 

---

The issues have been attributed to factors such as funding pressures, job cuts, and a push for **cost reduction** by encouraging **online tax management**. The NAO highlighted a 9% decrease in customer service staff between 2019-20 and 2023-24, along with a real-terms cut in spending of 6% since 2019-20. HMRC has been tasked with finding further savings, leading to plans for a 14% reduction in customer service numbers in 2024-25.

While the government has recently pledged an additional £51 million in funding, experts argue that this is insufficient to address the scale of the problem. They emphasize the need for well-publicized, accessible advice and support for taxpayers, especially given the increasing number of taxpayers and the current limitations of **automated digital services**. The call for improvement also extends to HMRC's digital offerings, which are currently unreliable and insufficient to meet taxpayer needs.

The summary highlights the consensus among experts and lawmakers that HMRC requires more resources and improved digital services to effectively serve taxpayers and meet its collection targets.
