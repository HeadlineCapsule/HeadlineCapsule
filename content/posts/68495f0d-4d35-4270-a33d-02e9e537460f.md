比尔·盖茨：别对人工智能能源消耗“反应过度”

# 比尔·盖茨为科技巨头对人工智能系统的投资辩护，称这将最终促进清洁电力的发展。

**新闻摘要：** 比尔·盖茨为科技巨头对能源密集型人工智能（AI）系统的投资辩护，称这将最终导致清洁电力蓬勃发展。他敦促环保主义者和政府不要过度反应对新生成AI系统能源消耗的担忧。数据中心预计将推动全球电力使用量增加2-6%，但盖茨相信它们也可能加速6%以上的排放减少。

**关键要点：**
- 比尔·盖茨为科技巨头对人工智能系统的投资及其对清洁电力增长的影响辩护。
- 数据中心可能会增加2-6%的全球电力消耗，但也可能加速排放减少。
- 科技公司愿意支付“绿色溢价”来购买清洁能源，从而推动其发展。
- 担心是否有足够的绿色电力满足不断增长的需求，以及如何在2050年实现碳中和的目标。

 **Article Summary:** Bill Gates defends Big Tech's investment in power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) systems, stating that it will ultimately lead to a boom in clean electricity. He urges environmentalists and governcuors not to overreact to concerns about the energy consumption of new generative AI systems. Data centers are expected to drive global electricity usage up by 2-6%, but Gates believes they could also accelerate more than a 6% reduction in emissions.

Microsoft co-founder and Breakthrough Energy group founder, Bill Gates, argues that tech companies will pay a "green premium" for clean energy as they seek new power sources, which is helping to drive its development and deployment. The Breakthrough Energy Summit featured speakers such as Prince William, former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi, and John Podesta.

However, Gates expresses concern about the availability of enough electricity needed for growing demand while cleaning up sectors like cement and steel. He suggests that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 may be unrealistic, proposing an additional 10 to 15 years as a more feasible timeline.

**Key Points:**
- Bill Gates defends Big Tech's investment in AI systems and their impact on clean electricity growth.
- Data centers may increase global electricity usage by 2-6%, but could also accelerate emissions reduction.
- Tech companies are willing to pay a "green premium" for clean energy, driving its development.
- Concerns about the availability of sufficient green electricity and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
