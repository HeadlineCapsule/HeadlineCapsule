Revolut 员工持股出售，估值超400亿美元

英国金融科技公司 Revolut 正通过员工股票出售寻求超过 400 亿美元的估值，据悉这笔交易将由软银支持的摩根士丹利承销。如果成功，这将标志着 Revolut 的估值至少比 2021 年提高了 20%，使其成为欧洲最具价值的初创公司。

在过去的两年里，欧洲金融科技集团面临着各种挑战，例如斯德哥尔摩的 Klarna 在 2022 年筹款期间估值大幅下跌，从 460 亿美元降至 67 亿美元。Revolut 也在处理其三年多前提交的英国银行牌照申请的不确定性，尽管客户存款和利率上涨，但最近报告了因成本上升而亏损。

Revolut 于 2015 年由 Nikolay Storonsky 和 Vlad Yatsenko 创立，与其他挑战者银行如 Monzo 和 Starling 一起成立。自那时起，它经历了快速增长，在全球拥有大约 4000 万客户，其中三分之一在英国。相比之下，Monzo 和 Starling 的客户数量各不到 1000 万，且仅在英国运营。

软银的愿景基金 2 和老虎全球管理等投资者帮助 Revolut 在 2021 年筹集了 8亿美元。该公司预计 2023 年收入将达到 17 亿英镑，比去年增长近一倍，并预测“两位数的净利润率”。

Revolut 正将其总部迁至伦敦金融区金丝雀码头的一栋建筑，并得到了 TCV、Balderton Capital、Ribbit Capital 和 Molten Ventures 等投资者的支持。

 **Summary of Article:**

UK-based fintech company Revolut is seeking a valuation exceeding $4cuillion through an employee share sale, according to sources familiar with the plans. The SoftBank-backed firm is working with Morgan Stanley to sell approximately $500mn worth of existing shares held by employees. If successful, this would mark at least a 20% increase from Revolut's previous valuation of $33bn in 2021 and make it Europe's most valuable start-up.

The ambitious target comes amidst challenges faced by European fintech groups over the past two years, such as Stockholm-based Klarna experiencing a significant drop in its valuation from $46bn to $6.7bn during 2022 fundraising. Revolut is also dealing with uncertainty regarding its application for a UK banking license submitted more than three years ago and has recently reported a loss due to rising costs, despite an increase in customer deposits and higher rates.

Revolut was founded by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko in 2015 alongside other challenger banks like Monzo and Starling. Since then, it has experienced rapid growth with approximately 40 million customers globally, a third of whom are based in the UK. In comparison, Monzo and Starling have less than 10 million customers each and operate solenly within the UK.

Investors such as SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global Management contributed to Revolut raising $800mn in 2021. The company anticipates revenues of £1.7bn in 2023, up from £923mn the previous year, with a projected "double-digit net profit margin."

Revolut is relocating its headquarters to one of London's Canary Wharf financial district buildings and has received backing from investors including TCV, Balderton Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Molten Ventures.
