乌克兰敦促债券持有人接受超过200亿美元的债务减记

# 乌克兰的债务重组努力

乌克兰敦促国际债权人接受超过 200 亿美元债务的显著折扣，以资助国家的战争努力并确保从国际货币基金组织获得救助。该国政府提议将外币债券的价值降低多达 60%，但投资者在本月早些时候的谈判中拒绝了这一提议。

在俄罗斯于 2022 年初入侵后，债权人授予乌克兰两年支付缓冲期，该缓冲期将于 8 月到期。政府需要债务重组才能继续获得国际货币基金组织的救助资金，并恢复用于重建工作的私人资金。

乌克兰旨在在未来一年内从债权人那里获得超过 50 亿美元的债务减免，届时预计将因战争融资而出现约 430 亿美元的预算赤字。财政部提议发行一种混合债券，在 2027 年之前支付象征性利息，如果乌克兰在未来两年内达到税收收入目标，证券可能会随着时间的推移减少债权人的损失。

然而，代表约 20% 债券的投资者委员会建议削减刚超过 22%，国际货币基金组织认为这不足以达到关键债务目标。债权人委员会提出了不同的方法，包括更高的利率和一种“恢复债券”，如果乌克兰的经济表现超出预期，该债券将增加支付额。

谈判仍在进行中，双方都致力于在当前支付冻结于 8 月到期之前达成协议。

 # Article Summary: Ukraine's Debt Restructuring Efforts

Ukraine is urging international bondholders to accept significant markdowns on more than $2ebn of debt in order to finance the nation's war effort and secure a bailout from the IMF. The country's government proposed reducing the value of foreign currency bonds by up to 60%, but investors rejected this proposal during negotiations earlier this month.

The bondholders granted Ukraine a two-year moratorium on payments following Russia's invasion in early 2022, which is set to expire in August. The government needs the debt restructuring to continue receiving IMF bailout funds and restore private funding for reconstruction efforts.

Ukraine aims to secure just over $5bn in debt relief from bondholders within the next year when it expects to run a budget deficit of about $43bn due to war financing. The finance ministry has proposed a mixture of bonds that will pay symbolic interest until 2027, with securities potentially reducing losses for bondholders over time if Ukraine meets tax revenue targets in the next two years.

However, an investor committee representing about 20% of the bonds suggested cuts of just over 22%, which was deemed insufficient by the IMF to meet key debt targets. The creditor committee has proposed a different approach with higher interest rates and a "recovery bond" that would increase payouts if Ukraine's economy outperforms expectations.

Talks are ongoing, and both parties remain committed to reaching an agreement before the current payment freeze expires in August.
