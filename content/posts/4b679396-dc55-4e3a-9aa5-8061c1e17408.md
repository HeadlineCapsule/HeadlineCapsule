# 保守党人抓住 GDP 反弹的机会，向心怀不满的选民宣扬经济复苏

**保守党**抓住了英国积极的经济增长数据，将其作为该国经济复苏和选举前景可能提振的信号。在最近地方选举失利后，**季度国内生产总值（GDP）**增长 0.6%，加上**英格兰银行**对潜在降息的鼓励性言论，给保守党带来了急需的喘息机会。这一数据表明英国已经摆脱了**技术性衰退**。

**财政大臣杰里米·亨特**宣布，自**新冠肺炎**疫情以来，英国经济首次“恢复全面健康”。与此同时，**唐宁街**内部人士暗示，由于增长强劲，今年晚些时候可能还会进一步**减税**。然而，包括前**英格兰银行**利率制定者迈克尔·桑德斯在内的经济学家警告称，英国尚未摆脱长期的**低增长陷阱**，**人均 GDP** 仍然落后。

选民们仍在从最近的**通货膨胀危机**中复苏，而**民意调查人员**预测，**首相里希·苏纳克**将难以仅凭增长数据在选举中获得显著动力。阻碍经济增长的根本因素，如**英国脱欧**和低投资，依然存在。作为亨特企业税改革重点的**商业投资**在 2024 年第一季度小幅增长 0.9%，自 2022 年初以来增长 9.8%，表明政府的税收激励措施可能正在产生积极影响。

**标普全球采购经理指数**显示，**建筑业**在 4 月恢复增长，而**服务业**则继续扩张。**消费者信心**也在同一个月上升了 2 个百分点。这些积极迹象，加上降息预期，可能成为苏纳克和保守党在即将到来的选举之前的一个有利因素。

亨特对**国民保险**减免和较低利率将提振选民信心的乐观态度，反映在他对第一季度数据将导致全年的**GDP 增长预测**上调的预测上。**唐宁街**的一位官员表示，经济持续改善可以为进一步减税铺平道路，减税是政府刺激增长的首要任务。

然而，YouGov 的民意调查显示，公众对保守党管理经济的能力仍缺乏信心，**工党**在经济信任度方面始终领先。前首相伊丽莎白·特拉斯 2022 年的“迷你”**预算**继续困扰着保守党，苏纳克在恢复人们对其经济管理的信心方面面临着一场艰苦的战斗。

虽然英国第一季度的经济增长令人鼓舞，但该国仍深陷增长乏力的泥潭，产出与去年持平，仅略高于两年前。**人均 GDP** 这一生活水平的重要指标仍低于疫情前水平，根据**预算责任办公室**的数据，**实际家庭可支配收入**预计要到 2025-26 年才会恢复。

民意调查公司 JL Partners 的汤姆·卢博克警告称，宣称经济仅基于 0.6% 的**GDP** 增长而出现反弹是“相当危险的”，因为许多选民仍在应对生活成本危机带来的压力。卢博克表示，公众对经济改善的说法仍然“极为不接受”。

# Tories seize on GDP rebound as they sell recovery story to sour electorate

**The Conservative Party** has seized on positive UK economic growth data, positioning it as a sign of the country's recovery and a potential boost for their election prospects. The 0.6% quarterly **GDP** rise, coupled with encouraging remarks from the **Bank of England** about potential interest rate cuts, has offered a much-needed reprieve for the Tories following their recent local election setbacks. This data indicates that the UK has emerged from a **technical recession**.

**Chancellor Jeremy Hunt** proclaimed that the economy is "returning to full health" for the first time since the **COVID-19** pandemic. Meanwhile, **Downing Street** insiders hinted at the possibility of additional **tax cuts** later this year, fueled by stronger growth. However, economists, including former **Bank of England** rate-setter Michael Saunders, cautioned that the UK has not escaped its long-term **low-growth trap**, with **GDP per head** still lagging.

Voters are still reeling from the recent **inflationary crisis**, and **pollsters** predict that **Prime Minister Rishi Sunak** will struggle to gain significant electoral momentum from the growth data alone. The underlying factors hindering economic growth, such as **Brexit** and low investment, persist. **Business investment**, a key focus of Hunt's corporate tax reforms, showed a modest increase of 0.9% in Q1 2024 and 9.8% since the start of 2022, suggesting that the government's tax incentives may be having a positive impact.

The **S&P Global purchasing manager indices** indicated that the **construction sector** returned to growth in April, while the **services sector** continued to expand. **Consumer confidence** also rose by two points in the same month. These positive signs, along with expectations of interest rate cuts, present a potential tailwind for Sunak and the Conservatives ahead of the upcoming election.

Hunt's optimism about the impact of **national insurance** reductions and lower interest rates on voter sentiment is reflected in his prediction that the first-quarter numbers will lead to upgrades in full-year **GDP growth forecasts**. A **Downing Street** official suggested that continued economic improvement could pave the way for further tax cuts, a priority for the government in stimulating growth.

However, the public's perception of the Conservatives' economic competence remains damaged, as evidenced by YouGov polling that shows the **Labour Party** consistently leading on economic trust. The legacy of former Prime Minister Liz Truss's "mini" **Budget** in 2022 continues to haunt the Conservatives, and Sunak faces an uphill battle to restore faith in their economic stewardship.

While the UK's economic growth in the first quarter is encouraging, the country remains mired in a period of sluggish growth, with output barely changed from the previous year and only marginally higher than two years ago. **GDP per capita**, a crucial indicator of living standards, lags pre-pandemic levels, and **real household disposable income** is not expected to recover until 2025-26, according to the **Office for Budget Responsibility**.

Tom Lubbock of JL Partners, a polling firm, warned that declaring an economic turnaround based on the 0.6% **GDP** increase could be "pretty dangerous," as many voters continue to feel the strain of the cost-of-living crisis. The public's mood, according to Lubbock, remains "extremely unreceptive" to claims of economic improvement.
