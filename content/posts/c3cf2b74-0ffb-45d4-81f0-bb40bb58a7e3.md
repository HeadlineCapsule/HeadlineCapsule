# 《体育画报》的争端揭示了**变现**品牌的潜在陷阱

2019 年，**真实品牌集团**(Authentic Brands Group) 以 1.1 亿美元收购了著名但陷入困境的《*体育画报(Sports Illustrated)*》杂志，该公司专门从事知识产权的收购和**变现**。 Authentic 拥有多个知名的时尚和名人品牌，打算将 SI 打造为涵盖体育博彩和票务销售的 **生活方式品牌**。

他们与媒体巨头 Arena Group 签署了授权协议，出版 SI 版本，由 Arena 赚取广告收入并支付版权费给 Authentic。然而，Arena 未能支付近期一笔 375 万美元的季度款项，导致 Authentic 起诉对方追讨未付款项以及他们认为应得的一笔 4500 万美元解约费。

这一情况凸显了**变现**有价值但陷入困境品牌所面临的挑战。虽然真实品牌集团 (Authentic) 在品牌复兴方面拥有成功的业绩和科学的方法，但在有效创收与通过过度激进的策略或牺牲内容质量而损害品牌声誉之间存在微妙的平衡。据报道，《体育画报》在 Authentic 推动**商业化**的过程中遭受了新闻诚信受损的问题。

随着真实品牌集团 (Authent Incumbents) 最近吸引了以200亿美元估值公司的投资，公司面临着确保其模式持续成功以及 Arena 等合作伙伴履行承诺的压力。然而，正如这一事件所表明的那样，找到能够在创收和品牌诚信之间取得平衡的合适合作伙伴绝非易事，一旦出现失误，很容易就会损害品牌来之不易的地位。

# Sports Illustrated fight shows pitfalls in **monetizing** brands 

**Authentic Brands Group**, a company specializing in acquiring and monetizing intellectual property, has run into issues with its purchase of the iconic but struggling **Sports Illustrated (SI)** magazine. Authentic, which owns several well-known fashion and celebrity brands, bought SI for over $110 million in 2019, intending to turn it into a **lifestyle brand** encompassing sports betting and ticket sales. 

They signed a licensing deal with media conglomerate Arena Group to publish an SI version, with Arena earning ad revenue while paying royalties to Authentic. However, Arena failed to make a recent quarterly payment of $3.75 million, leading Authentic to sue for the missed payment and a $45 million termination fee it believes it is owed. 

This situation highlights the challenges in **monetizing** beloved but troubled brands. While Authentic has a track record of success and a scientific approach to brand revival, there can be a fine line between effective revenue generation and tarnishing a brand's reputation through overly aggressive tactics or sacrificing quality content. In the case of SI, its journalistic integrity has reportedly suffered as Authentic pushes for more **commercialization**. 

With Authentic having recently attracted investments that valued the company at $20 billion, there is pressure to ensure their model continues to succeed and that partners like Arena deliver on their commitments. However, as this situation demonstrates, finding suitable partners who can balance revenue generation with brand integrity is no easy task, and missteps can quickly erode a brand's hard-earned stature.
