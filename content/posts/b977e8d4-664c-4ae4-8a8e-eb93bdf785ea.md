# 阿鲁普公司在香港深伪视频会议骗局中损失2500万美元

**总部位于英国的工程集团** Arup 在香港遭遇了一起复杂的**深伪**骗局，损失高达 2 亿港元（约合 2500 万美元）。**香港警方**此前披露了此事件，称其为全球最大的**深伪骗局**之一，但未透露公司名称。

骗局涉及诈骗者利用**数位克隆版本**冒充一名高级经理（首席财务官）在视频会议中欺骗员工，并授权进行财务转帐。此次事件凸显了当**深伪**技术（由**人工智能生成的极其逼真的内容**）被网络罪犯利用时，对组织或政府所构成的严重威胁。

Arup 确认了骗局中使用了虚假的声音和图像，但坚称其内部系统仍然安全可靠，业务和财务保持稳定。香港警方仍在调查此案，目前尚无逮捕行动。

该事件导致 Arup 东亚区主席 Andy Lee 离职，由 Michael Kwok 接任。Lee 称是因为有“新的机会”而决定离职。Arup 全球首席信息官 Rob Greig 强调了深伪骗局的日益复杂性，并表示希望他们的经历能提高人们对这类不断演变的威胁的认识。

此次骗局凸显了各企业和银行亟需加强网络安全措施，以及立法机构有必要解决人们对新兴骗局手法（如深伪技术）缺乏认识的问题。

# Arup lost $25mn in Hong Kong deepfake video conference scam

**UK-based engineering group** Arup, employing 18,000 people worldwide with annual revenues exceeding £2bn, fell victim to a sophisticated deepfake scam, losing HK$200mn ($25mn). The **Hong Kong police** had previously disclosed the incident as one of the world's largest **deepfake scams**, without identifying the company. 

The scam involved fraudsters using a **digitally cloned version** of a senior manager, the CFO, to deceive staff and authorize financial transfers during a video conference. This incident underscores the grave threat posed by **deepfakes**—**hyper-realistic content generated using artificial intelligence**—when exploited by cybercriminals to target organizations or governments. 

Arup, while confirming the use of fake voices and images, maintained that their internal systems remained secure and unaffected, ensuring business continuity and financial stability. Hong Kong police are still investigating the case, with no arrests made yet. 

The incident led to the departure of Arup's East Asia chair, Andy Lee, who was replaced by Michael Kwok. Lee cited a "new opportunity" as his reason for leaving. Arup's global chief information officer, Rob Greig, emphasized the increasing sophistication of deepfake scams and expressed hopes that their experience would raise awareness of such evolving threats. 

This scam highlights the critical need for corporations and banks to enhance cybersecurity measures and for legislators to address the lack of awareness surrounding emerging scam tactics, such as deepfakes.
