美银行宣布股息派发后通过美联储“压力测试”

# 美国银行在通过美联储的“压力测试”后宣布股息派发

美国联邦储备委员会确认，包括美国银行、花旗集团、摩根士丹利和摩根大通在内的所有接受测试的银行都成功通过了年度“压力测试”。这些压力测试旨在评估这些金融机构在严重经济衰退下的应对能力。因此，多家银行宣布了增加股息派发和实施未来回购计划的计划。

**重点要点：**
- 联邦储备委员会测试的 31 家银行都通过了今年的压力测试。
- 美国银行、花旗集团、摩根士丹利和摩根大通等银行计划提高股息派发并实施股票回购计划。
- 压力测试衡量银行在经济衰退下的生存能力，并为潜在损失设定了最低资本要求。

**股息增加：**
- 花旗集团将季度股息提高 6% 至每股 0.56 美元，尽管它是唯一一家与去年相比减少压力测试损失的主要银行。
- 摩根大通计划将其第三季度股息提高近 9% 至每股 1.25 美元，并授权一项新的 300 亿美元股票回购计划。
- 高盛将股息提高了 9%，尽管资本充足率要求有所增加。
- 摩根士丹利将其股息提高了近 9%，并授权了一项 200 亿美元的回购计划。
- 威富公司宣布第三季度每股股息增加 14%，达到 0.40 美元，并可能在未来一年内进行股票回购。
- 美国银行将其股息提高了 8%，第三季度每股 0.26 美元。

**资本要求和政治辩论：**
大型美国银行需要持有的资本金额已成为一个重要的政治问题，监管机构根据新的国际标准提出了增加资本要求的提案。该提案导致银行业在过去一年中进行了积极的游说活动。

 **US Banks Announce Dividend Payouts After Passing Fed's 'Stress Tests'**

The Federal Reserve has confirmed that all amoled banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, successfully passed the annual "stress tests." These stress tests are designed to assess the ability of these financial institutions to withstand a severe economic downturn. As a result, several banks have announced plans to increase their dividend payouts and implement future stock buyback programs.

**Key Points:**
- All 31 banks tested by the Federal Reserve passed this year's stress tests.
- Banks such as Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase plan to increase dividend payouts and stock buyback programs.
- The stress test measures a bank's ability to survive an economic downturn and sets minimum capital requirements for potential losses.

**Dividend Increases:**
- Citigroup increased its quarterly dividend by 6% to $0.56 per share, despite being the only major bank with reduced stress test losses compared to last year.
- JPMorgan Chase plans a nearly 9% increase in its third-quarter dividend to $1.25 per share and authorized a new $30 billion stock buyback program.
- Goldman Sachs increased its dividend by cuatro por ciento (nine percent) despite an uptick in capital ratio requirements.
- Morgan Stanley lifted its dividend by almost 9% and authorized a $20 billion buyback program.
- Wells Fargo announced a 14% increase to 40 cents per share for the third quarter, with potential stock repurchases in the coming year.
- Bank of America raised its dividend by 8% to 26 cents per share for the third quarter.

**Capital Requirements and Political Debate:**
The amount of capital large US banks are required to hold has become a significant political issue, with regulators proposing increased capital requirements under new international standards. This proposal led to an aggressive lobbying effort by the banking industry over the past year.
