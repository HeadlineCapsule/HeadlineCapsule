拜登在D日讲话中警告民主面临的威胁

**乔·拜登总统的“D日”演讲**

在纪念“D日”96周年的演讲中，美国总统乔·拜登敦促美国人捍卫民主，并学习美国军队在第二次世界大战期间表现出的勇气。这次讲话是在诺曼底的“Pointe du Hoc”进行的，这是1944年6月6日数千名美军登陆的地方。

**要点：**
- 拜登唤起了“D日”的精神，以强调他对民主和对手政治政策的担忧。
- 他没有提及前总统唐纳德·特朗普的名字，但暗示了在美国和海外捍卫民主权利，并提到了1月6日对国会大厦的袭击威胁到民主。
- 拜登批评了特朗普的“美国优先”外交政策立场，包括威胁退出北约或停止支持乌克兰。他质疑“D日”老兵是否希望美国今天独自行动。
- 演讲地点具有象征意义，因为前总统罗纳德·里根也在1984年在“Pointe du Hoc”发表了激动人心的演讲，呼吁美国人为他们的理想而站起来。

**拜登与乌克兰总统沃洛德米尔·泽连斯基的会面：**
- 拜登与乌克兰总统会面，并为由于与特朗普有关的共和党孤立主义派别而导致的美国支持延迟表示歉意。
- 泽连斯基认为最近的援助交付“非常重要”，强调这对乌克兰人民感到自己并不孤单至关重要。

 **President Joe Biden's D-Day Speech**  

During a speech commemorating the ninety-sixth anniversary of D-Day, President Joe Biden urged Americans to uphold democracy and draw on the bravery exhibited by US forces during World War II. The address took place at Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, where thousands of American troops landed on June 6, 1944.

**Key Points:**  
- Biden invoked the spirit of D-Day to highlight concerns about democracy and policies of his political opponent.
- He did not mention former President Donald Trump by name but alluded to defending democratic rights in the US and abroad, referencing the January 6th attack on the Capitol as a threat to democracy.
- Biden criticized Trump's "America First" foreign policy stance, including threats to withdraw from NATO or cease support for Ukraine. He questioned whether D-Day veterans would want America to go it alone today.
- The location of the speech held symbolic significance as former President Ronald Reagan also delivered a rousing address at Pointe du Hoc in 1984, calling on Americans to stand up for their ideals.

**Biden's Meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:**  
- Biden met with the Ukrainian president and apologized for delays in US support due to an isolationist wing within the Republican party connected to Trump.
- The recent aid deliveries were deemed "very important" by Zelenskyy, emphasizing that it was necessary for the feeling of their people not being alone.
