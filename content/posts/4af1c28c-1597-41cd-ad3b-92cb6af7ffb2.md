挪威石油基金将投票反对埃克森美孚，以维护股东权益

**摘要：**
挪威1.5万亿美元的主权财富基金Norges Bank Investment Management（NBIM）宣布，将反对ExxonMobil首席董事Jay Hooley在公司5月29日年度股东大会上的连任。这一决定是由于对股东权利和诉讼的担忧，ExxonMobil发起了诉讼，起诉两个关注气候问题的股东团体，以阻止他们提出的关于加强温室气体排放削减措施的决议。该案在投资者中引发了对美国股东民主的潜在影响的担忧，并促使大型投资者向Exxon的董事施压，要求他们在年度会议上投反对票。

**有趣的问题：**

1. Norges Bank Investment Management的决定如何反映了金融界对股东权利的广泛担忧？
   - 答案：挪威主权财富基金决定反对ExxonMobil董事Jay Hooley的连任，突显了投资者对股东民主面临潜在威胁的日益担忧。这种担忧是由Exxon对关注气候问题的股东团体提起诉讼所引发的，该诉讼引发了对美国股东权利受到更广泛攻击的担忧，并可能对小型投资者提出动议（尤其是与气候问题相关的动议）产生寒蝉效应。

2. ExxonMobil起诉两个关注气候问题的股东团体的意义是什么？
   - 答案：ExxonMobil起诉美国投资顾问Arjuna Capital和总部位于阿姆斯特丹的Follow This，标志着公司行为可能发生转变，即限制股东对公司政策的影响力。通过挑战要求加强温室气体排放削减措施的决议，Exxon正在试图限制股东权利，并有可能改变代理人征求意见程序的规则。

3. 这种情况可能会对未来的企业治理实践产生什么影响？
   - 答案：此案的结果可能为公司如何回应股东决议（尤其是与气候变化或其他社会问题相关的决议）设定先例。如果ExxonMobil的诉讼成功，法院裁定限制股东权利，则可能会鼓励更多公司对活跃投资者采取类似行动。这可能会导致企业治理实践的转变，优先考虑保护高管决策而不是解决股东对气候变化和社会责任等关键问题的关切。

**Summary:**  
Norway's $1.5tn sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), has announced its intention to vote against the re-election of ExxonMobil’s lead director Jay Hooley at the company's annual meeting on May 29th. This decision is a result of concerns over shareholder rights and litigation initiated by ExxonMobil, which filed a lawsuit against two climate-focused shareholder groups to block their resolution demanding more action on greenhouse gas emissions reduction.

A: The lawsuit filed by ExxonMobil against US investment adviser Arjuna Capital and Amsterdam-based Follow This signifies a potential shift in corporate behavior towards limiting the influence of shareholders on company policies.
