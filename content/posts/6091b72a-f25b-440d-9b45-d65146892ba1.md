# Siemens Energy Announces New Chief and Job Cuts to Revive Wind Business 

**Siemens Energy** announced a leadership change and strategic adjustments for its wind turbine business, Siemens Gamesa, as part of a turnaround plan to address recent challenges. The company's shares rose 13% following the announcement of a fourfold increase in quarterly group **operating profit** and an improved full-year revenue growth forecast. 

**/n**/n**Vinod Philip**, the incoming CEO of Siemens Gamesa, will oversee **cost-cutting measures**, including **job cuts**, aimed at restoring the division's financial health. The company's suspension of sales for two troubled turbine models due to engineering defects had resulted in significant losses and prompted a government bailout. Siemens Energy raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to 10-12%, up from the previous 3-7% estimate, signaling optimism in the turnaround.**/n**/n

The company attributes the robust quarterly results to the performance of its **Grid Technologies** and **Transformation of Industry** divisions, with Siemens Gamesa expected to significantly contribute to revenue growth in the second half. Siemens Gamesa will focus on streamlining operations, targeting Europe and the US markets, and increasing production capacity at key sites. The wider wind industry, despite facing pressure from rising interest rates and supply chain issues, continues to experience high demand, with a record 117 gigawatts of new capacity installed last year.
