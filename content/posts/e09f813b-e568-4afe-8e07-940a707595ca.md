德国人工智能国防初创公司赫尔辛格即将将估值翻三番至45亿美元

**德国人工智能国防初创公司 Helsing 即将三倍估值** 

赫尔辛格是一家总部位于慕尼黑的欧洲国防科技初创公司，目前正在与硅谷投资者 Accel 和 Lightspeed Venture Partners 进行谈判，计划筹集近 5 亿美元资金。这笔交易将使赫尔辛格的估值达到 **45 亿美元**，在全球冲突导致对军事供应商的私人投资激增的情况下，其价值在一年内翻了三番。

Accel 和 Lightspeed 预计将与现有支持者 General Catalyst 一起加入这一轮新投资者。如果成功，赫尔辛格将成为欧洲最有价值的人工智能初创公司之一，突显了传统风险资本家对国防科技公司的兴趣日益浓厚。

赫尔辛格成立于 2021 年，专门开发基于人工智能的软件，用于处理传感器和武器系统产生的大量数据，以提供实时战场情报并辅助军事决策。该公司还在利用其软件为乌克兰无人机开发人工智能能力。

赫尔辛格此前于 9 月宣布的筹款活动筹集了 2.09 亿欧元，估值约为 15 亿欧元。然而，正在讨论的新一轮筹款将使公司估值达到 **50 亿美元**，包括新筹集的资金。这使赫尔辛格与巴黎人工智能初创公司 Mistral 等其他高估值的欧洲科技公司并驾齐驱，后者最近获得了近 60 亿欧元的估值。

现代战争从传统硬件转向软件定义技术，导致国家国防预算增加，风险投资者对该领域的兴趣日益浓厚。今年，北约开始将其新的 10 亿欧元“创新基金”投资于欧洲科技公司。赫尔辛格还与德国莱茵金属和瑞典阿莫巴萨博等成熟的欧洲国防承包商合作，将人工智能集成到战斗机等现有平台中。

一些人认为赫尔辛格是欧洲对安杜里尔的回应，这是一家总部位于加利福尼亚的国防科技初创公司，预计下个月将在 125 亿美元的估值下完成 15 亿美元的筹款活动。

 **German AI Defence Start-Up Helsing Set to Triple Valuation**  

Helsing, a European defence technology start-up based in Munich, is currently engaged in talks with Silicon Valley investors Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners for an almost $500 million fundraising round. This deal would raise Helsing's valuation to **$4.5 billion**, tripling its worth within a year amidst the surge of private investments in military suppliers due to global conflicts.

Accel and Lightspeed are expected to be joined by General Catalyst, an existing backer, as new investors in this round. If successful, Helsing would become one of Europe's most valuable artificial intelligence start-ups, highlighting the growing interest from traditional venture capitalists for defence tech companies.

Founded in 2021, Helsing specializes in AI-based software that processes vast amounts of data generated by sensors and weapons systems to provide real-time battlefield intelligence and aid military decision-making. The company's software is also being utilized for developing AI capabilities for drones in Ukraine.

Helsing's previous fundraising round, announced in September, raised €209 million at a valuation of about €1.5 billion. However, the new round under discussion would value the company at **$5 billion**, including the fresh capital being raised. This places Helsing alongside other highly valued European tech companies such as Paris-based Mistral, an AI start-up that recently secured a valuation of almost €6 billion.

The shift in modern warfare from traditional hardware to software-defined technologies has led to increased defence spending by nation states and venture investors' growing interest in the sector. This year, Nato began investing its new €1bn "innovation fund" in European tech companies. Helsing has also partnered with established European defence contractors like Germany's Rheinmetall and Sweden'amoeba Saab to integrate AI into existing platforms such as fighter jets.

Helsing is seen by some as Europe's answer to Anduril, a California-based defence tech start-up set to close a $1.5 billion fundraising round next month at a valuation of **$12.5 billion**.
