BHP 的「最终」出价似乎不足以打动英美资源集团。

# BHP收购**英美资源集团**(Anglo American)的第三次及“最终”报价

## 摘要：
为了收购竞争对手矿商**英美资源集团**，BHP提出了第三轮以及"最终"报价，每股英美资源集团股份将获得0.886股BHP股份。与之前报价相比有所增加，但交易结构仍较为复杂，投资者面临分离公司资产时未知的风险。随着双方继续就缓解方案和**风险管理策略**进行谈判，英国**收购委员会**(Takeover Panel)的最后期限也被延长。

## 引人深思的问题：

**Q1: BHP的“最终”报价为何未被英美资源集团接受？**
**A1:** 主要原因在于交易结构复杂，使投资者面临分离公司资产时的未知风险和成本。此外，与其它潜在竞标或BHP可能提出的修订方案相比，该报价可能被认为不够丰厚，无法充分解决英美资源集团的担忧。

**Q2: 延期最后期限将如何影响BHP与英美资源集团之间的谈判？** 
**A2:** 英国收购委员会（Takeover Panel）延长最终期限为双方提供了更多讨论时间，或许能促使一方提出修订报价或是达成风险缓解策略协议。这段额外时间也可能为其他竞标者创造机会，影响英美资源集团的决策过程。 

**Q3: 南非** **公共投资公司**在此次收购企图中扮演何种角色？其要求又将如何影响结果?** 
**A3:** 身为南非国营企业的**公共投资公司(Public Investment Corporation)**是英美资源集团的主要股东，持有12%股份。他们对BHP提案的"重大修订"要求表明目前报价未能令其满意，并可能影响其他投资者，甚至英美资源集团董事会层面。若其要求与其他股东方一致，可能会增加双方达成更有利于英美资源集团利益协议的压力

## Summary:
In an attempt to acquire rival miner **Anglo American**, BHP has made a third and "final" offer of 0.886 shares for each Anglo share, representing a modest increase from previous offers. However, the structure remains complex, with investors exposed to unknown risks in separating company assets. The UK Takeover Panel deadline was extended as both companies continue negotiations over mitebutting proposals and risk management strategies.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What are some potential reasons for BHP's "final" offer not being accepted by Anglo American?
A1: The primary reason is the complex structure of the deal, which leaves investors exposed to unknown risks and costs in separating company assets. Additionally, the offer may be perceived as insufficient compared to other potential offers or a revised proposal from BHP that could better address Anglo's concerns.

Q2: How might the extended deadline impact negotiations between BHP and Anglo American?
A2: The extension of the UK Takeover Panel deadline allows for more time for both companies to engage in further discussions, potentially leading to a revised offer or agreement on risk mitigation strategies. This additional time may also open up opportunities for other parties to present competing offers that could influence Anglo's decision-making process.

Q3: What role does the Public Investment Corporation play in this acquisition attempt, and how might their demands affect the outcome?
A3: The South Africa's state-owned **Public Investment Corporation** is a significant shareholder of Anglo American, holding 12% of its shares. Their demand for a "meaningful revision" to BHP's proposal indicates that they are not satisfied with the current offer and may influence other investors or even the board of directors at Anglo American. If their demands align with those of other shareholders, it could lead to increased pressure on both companies to reach a more favorable agreement for Anglo's stakehold
