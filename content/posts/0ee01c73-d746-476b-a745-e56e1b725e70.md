美国真的从欧洲转移了绿色投资吗？

# 欧盟直接投资概况

欧盟的直接投资环境呈现出 outbound 和 inbound 公告显著增长的景象，尤其是在可再生能源和半导体/电子行业。然而，美国仍然看到这些投资更多地指向其国内项目，而不是来自像欧盟这样的其他国家。

# 欧盟国际直接投资净头寸

自疫情以来，欧盟的国际直接投资净头寸相对稳定，与前几年相比略有偏向内向投资流动。这表明尽管资本可能不会大量流向美国，但欧盟的政策框架仍然对其具有吸引力。

# 直接投资流动的波动性

直接投资流动的波动性和缺乏季度详细数据使人很难得出关于短期趋势或波动的明确结论。然而，欧盟国际直接投资净头寸的总体稳定性表明，资本没有从欧洲大量流出到像美国这样的国家。

# 欧盟经济的出口顺差

欧盟经济的大额出口顺差在其投资模式和资本流动中发挥着作用。为了在不减少出口的情况下增加国内投资，欧盟需要专注于在国内提高消费和资本投资水平。这将需要从仅依靠贸易平衡改善转向培养一个鼓励该地区内投资增长的环境。

# 彼得森研究所的报告

雅各布·基尔基戈德（Jacob Kirkegaard）撰写的彼得森研究所报告深入探讨了欧盟和中国在电动汽车领域的贸易和投资发展，表明两个地区之间蓬勃合作的潜力。

# 爱沙尼亚立法

爱沙尼亚已通过立法，允许没收俄罗斯的主权资产以造福乌克兰，这表明即使俄罗斯在爱沙尼亚持有的此类资产不多，这种行动在实践上和法律上是可行的。

1. The EU's direct investment landscape has seen a significant increase in both outbound and inbound announcements, particularly in renewables and semiconductors/electronics sectors. However, the US still sees more of these investments directed towards its own domestic projects rather than being sourced from other countries like the EU.

2. The overall net international FDI position of the EU has remained relatively stable since the pandemic, with a slight shift in favor of inward investment flows compared to previous years. This indicates that while there may not be significant capital diversion towards the US, the EU's policy framework is still maintaining its attractiveness for direct investments.

3. The volatility in measured direct investment flows and the lack of detailed data on a quarterly basis make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about short-term trends or fluctuations. However, the overall stability of EU's net international FDI position suggests that there is no significant capital outflow from Europe towards other countries like the US.

4. The large export surplus of the EU economy plays a role in its investment patterns and capital flows. To boost domestic investments without reducing exports, the EU needs to focus on increasing consumption alongside higher levels of capital investment at home. This would require a shift from relying solely on trade balance improvements towards fostering an environment that encourages increased investment within the region.

5. The Peterson Institute's report by Jacob Kirkegaard provides nuanced insights into EU-China trade and investment developments in electric vehicles, indicating potential for a thriving collaborative relationship between the two regions.

6. Estonia has passed legislation allowing for the confiscation of Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine, demonstrating that such actions are practically and legally feasible even if there aren't many such assets held by Russia in Estonia.
