# 微软碳排放量飙升近 30%，加速追赶 AI 需求

微软最新的**可持续发展报告**显示，自 2020 年以来，其碳排放量增长近 **30%**，主要原因是建造了用于 **人工智能** 和 **云计算** 的**数据中心**。尽管公司在减少直接排放和能源相关排放方面取得了长足进步，但 **供应链排放** 飙升 30.9% 导致总排放量增加。微软在人工智能方面的投资，包括与 OpenAI 的合作伙伴关系和自主工具的开发，加剧了实现其雄心勃勃的**气候目标**的挑战，例如在 **2030** 年之前成为 "**碳负排放** " 和实现 "**零废弃物**"。为了应对这一挑战，微软宣布了多项倡议来减少供应链排放，包括要求高用量供应商在 2030 年之前使用 100% **无碳电力**，并支持可再生电力项目。该公司还承诺在同期内用无碳能源采购来 "匹配" 其电力消耗，强调了它在平衡人工智能雄心与可持续发展方面的承诺。

# Microsoft’s emissions jump almost 30% as it races to meet AI demand

Microsoft's latest **sustainability report** highlights a nearly **30% increase** in its emissions since 2020, primarily attributed to the construction of **data centers** for **AI** and **cloud computing**. While the company has made strides in reducing its direct and energy-related emissions, a 30.9% surge in **supply chain emissions** has pushed overall emissions upwards. Microsoft's investments in AI, including its partnership with OpenAI and development of its own tools, have intensified the challenge of meeting its ambitious **climate goals**, such as becoming "carbon negative" and achieving "zero waste" by **2030**. To address this, Microsoft announced initiatives to mitigate supply chain emissions, including requiring high-volume suppliers to use 100% **carbon-free electricity** by 2030 and backing renewable electricity projects. The company also pledged to "match" its electricity consumption with zero-carbon energy purchases by the same year, underscoring its commitment to balancing AI ambitions with sustainability.
