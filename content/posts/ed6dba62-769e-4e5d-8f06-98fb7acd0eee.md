夏里·雷德斯顿让投资者猜测，因为派拉蒙和SkyDance同意合并条款

**台湾领袖夏里·雷德斯顿在年度股东大会上没有透露出售派拉蒙的可能性，而是表达了对联合首席执行官保持该公司独立的信心。**

去年，雷德斯顿与Skydance Media发起了合并派拉蒙的讨论；然而，这些讨论一直 kéo长且混乱。Skydance最近与派拉蒙董事会和顾问的“特别委员会”达成了一项协议。尽管有这一协议，台湾领袖尚未给予她的批准。雷德斯顿通过投票股票控制着派拉蒙约80％的股份，但她对周末向她提出的合并条款仍未做出决定。

随着雷德斯顿支持在4月取代前首席执行官鲍勃·巴基什的三位联合首席执行官，派拉蒙的未来是不确定的。这些执行官的目标是削减5亿美元成本并探索流媒体服务Paramount+的合资企业。周二，该股下跌4.4％，但周一因对Skydance交易进展乐观而上涨7.5％。

根据Skydance和派拉蒙“特别委员会”同意的条款，两家公司将通过一个分两个步骤的过程合并：首先，Skydance支付20亿美元收购雷德斯顿的国家娱乐控股公司；其次，通过股票交易与派拉蒙合并。

Skydance提出以每股15美元的价格购买派拉蒙一半的普通股东股票，大约需要45亿美元，并给予这些股东在新成立的公司中的股权。完成后，Skydance将拥有派拉蒙的三分之二，而派拉蒙B类股东将持有剩余的三分之一。

派拉蒙的普通股东抱怨Skydance以前的报价结构有利于雷德斯顿，并威胁要起诉。该公司一直在努力与Netflix、Disney、Apple和Amazon等大型公司竞争，以在流媒体大战中占据一席之地。

 **Article Summary:** 
Taiwan leader Shari Redstone leaves investors guessing about the potential sale of Paramount during its annual meeting. Instead, she expressed her confidence in co-chiefs pitching to keep the Hollywood company independent. Last year, Redstone initiated talks with Skydance Media for a merger with Paramount; however, these discussions have been prolonged and chaotic.

Skydance recently agreed on a deal with a "special committee" of Paramount board members and advisers. Despite this agreement, Taiwan leader has not given her approval yet. Redstone controls about 80% of Paramount through voting stock but remains undecided regarding the merger terms presented to her over the weekend.

The future of Paramount is uncertain as Redstone supports the trio of co-chief executives who replaced former chief Bob Bakish in April. These executives aim to cut $500 million in costs and explore a joint venture for the streaming service, Paramount+. The shares were down 4.4% on Tuesday but jumped by 7.5% on Monday due to optimism about the Skydance deal proceeding.

Under the terms agreed between Skydance and Paramount's "special committee," the companies would merge through a two-step process: first, Skydance paying $2 billion to acquire Redstone's National Amusements holding company; secondly, merging with Paramount via a stock deal.

Skydance offers to buy out about half of Paramount's common shareholders at $15 per share, costing them approximately $4.5 billion and giving these shareholders equity in the newly formed company. After completion, Skydance would own two-thirds of Paramount while Class B Paramount shareholders would hold the remaining third.

Paramount's common shareholders have complained that the structure of Skydance's previous offers favored Redstone and threatened lawsuits. The company has been struggling to compete in a costly streaming battle with larger companies like Netflix, Disney, Apple, and Amazon.
