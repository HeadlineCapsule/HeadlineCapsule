# 中国在欧盟周边国家的投资远超美国 

**中国**在**欧洲复兴开发银行**（EBRD）的36个业务地区国家的投资大幅增长，2023年，这些国家**新建项目**的投资来源中有近39%来自中国。这一数字较2022年的5.1%大幅增加，与20年前的0.6%相比更是显著增长。EBRD首席经济学家**贝塔·亚沃奇克**将这一增长归因于中国在潜在贸易壁垒面前实施的**生产地点多元化**战略，以及对美国补贴的利用。 

亚沃奇克强调，这一趋势与美国在20世纪80年代针对日本汽车制造商采取的做法类似，这表明欧盟可以采取吸引中国制造商的策略，而不是实施阻碍措施。由于布鲁塞尔对受补贴的中国企业的立场，中国在欧盟中部和东部成员国的**外国直接投资**相对落后，但在其他地区则占主导地位。 

EBRD的报告还提到了该地区各国面临的经济挑战，包括持续的通货膨胀和俄罗斯-乌克兰冲突的影响。该行略微下调了2024年的GDP预测，称中欧和波罗的海国家的增长势头减弱，部分原因是德国经济放缓。报告还指出，东欧国家面临的另一阻碍是过去两年中不断上升的借贷成本。

# China 'Dwarfs' US Investments in EU Neighbourhood Countries 

**Chinese investments** in 36 countries where the **European Bank of Reconstruction and Development** (EBRD) operates have surged, with nearly 39% of their combined **greenfield investments** originating from China in 2023. This marks a significant increase from 5.1% in 2022 and a stark contrast to 0.6% 20 years ago. The EBRD's chief economist, **Beata Javorcik**, attributes this surge to China's strategy to **diversify production locations** in the face of potential trade barriers and take advantage of US subsidies. 

Javorcik highlights that this trend is similar to the US approach with Japanese carmakers in the 1980s, suggesting that the EU could attract Chinese manufacturers rather than impose blocking measures. While China's **foreign direct investment** (FDI) lags in the EU's central and eastern member states due to Brussels' stance on subsidized Chinese companies, it dominates in other regions. 

The EBRD report also touches on the economic challenges faced by countries in its regions, including persistent inflation and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The bank has slightly lowered its GDP forecast for 2024, citing weakening growth in central Europe and the Baltic states, partly due to the slowdown in Germany's economy. The rise in borrowing costs over the past two years is also noted as a hindrance for countries in eastern Europe.
