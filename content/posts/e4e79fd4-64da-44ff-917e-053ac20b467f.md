美国试图通过中国切断俄罗斯战争机器的供应

**摘要：**
在柏林的一次演讲中，**美国财政部副部长沃利·阿迪莫** 敦促乌克兰的盟友和西方企业停止通过中国向俄罗斯国防工业供应关键部件。美国威胁说，如果有中国公司供应这些商品，将对其实施二级制裁。根据基辅经济学校的数据，**中国占俄罗斯双重用途高科技产品进口的近三分之二**，但用于俄罗斯武器的大多数进口部件都是西方制造的。

美国还关注可能促进这些交易的银行，并希望他们加强尽职调查工作。欧洲中央银行已警告欧元区贷款机构，如果它们在俄罗斯的业务没有迅速退出，可能会受到美国的二级制裁。

**有趣的问题：**

Q1: 中国作为俄罗斯关键部件供应商的角色可能会如何影响其与西方国家的关系，尤其是与美国的关系？
A1: 如果中国继续供应这些部件，可能会导致与中国西方国家的关系紧张。美国已威胁说，如果发现有中国公司正在协助俄罗斯的国防工业，将对其实施二级制裁。这可能会导致两国之间的贸易和外交关系恶化，以及中国企业可能面临的经济后果。

Q2: 银行可以采取哪些措施来加强涉及双重用途商品的交易的尽职调查？
A2: 银行可以通过实施更严格的合规协议、对参与此类交易的客户和 counterparty 进行彻底的背景调查、更密切地监控可疑活动以及与国际监管机构合作来加强尽职调查。通过这些措施，他们可以帮助执行针对俄罗斯等国家的制裁，防止为可能用于支持军事努力的双重用途商品提供资金。

Q3: 俄罗斯越来越依赖中国供应商为其提供关键部件，这可能会如何影响其国防工业和整体战争努力？
A3: 随着俄罗斯增加对中国的依赖，如果两国关系恶化或实施二级制裁，俄罗斯可能会变得更加脆弱。这可能导致供应链中断，影响俄罗斯国防工业有效维护和升级武器的能力。此外，由于国际压力和出口管制，俄罗斯在寻找这些关键部件的其他来源时可能会遇到困难。

**Summary:**  
In a speech in Berlin, **US deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo** urged Ukraine's allies and western businesses to halt the flow of critical components for Russia's defense industry through China. The US has threatened secondary sanctions against Chinese companies supplying these goods. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, while **China accounts for almost two-thirds of Russia’s imports** of dual-use high-technology goods, most imported components used in Russian weaponry are of western origin.

The US is also focusing on banks that may be facilitating these transactions and wants them to enhance their due diligence efforts. The European Central Bank has warned Eurozone lenders with Russian operations about potential secondary sanctions from the US if they do not exit Russia quickly enough.

**Interesting Questions:**  
Q1: How might China's role as a supplier of critical components to Russia impact its relationship with Western countries, particularly the United States?  
A1: If China continues to supply these components, it risks straining relations with Western nations. The US has threatened secondary sanctions against Chinese companies found to be assisting Russia’s defense industry. This could lead to a deterioration in trade and diplomatic ties between the two countries, as well as potential economic repercussions for China if its businesses are targeted by these sanctions.

Q2: What measures can banks take to enhance their due diligence efforts when it comes to transactions involving dual-use goods?  
A2: Banks can implement stricter compliance protocols, conduct thorough background checks on clients and counterparties involved in such transactions, monitor for suspicious activity more closely, and collaborate with international regulatory bodies. By doing so, they can help enforce sanctions against countries like Russia by preventing the financing of dual-use goods that could be used to support military efforts.

Q3: How might Russia's increased reliance on Chinese suppliers for critical components affect its defense industry and overall war effort?  
A3: As Russia increases its dependence on China for these vital supplies, it may become more vulnerable if the relationship between the two countries deteriorates or if secondary sanctions are imposed. This could lead to disruptions in the supply chain, impacting the Russian defense industry's ability to maintain and upgrade weaponry effectively. Additionally, Russia might face challenges sourcing alternative suppliers for these critical components due to international pressure and export controls.
