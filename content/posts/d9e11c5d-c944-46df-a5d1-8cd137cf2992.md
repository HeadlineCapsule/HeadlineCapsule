旧金山联储主席称科技创业者可助城市避免“毁灭性循环”

旧金山联储主席玛丽·达利敦促科技创业者让员工回归工作

旧金山联邦储备银行行长玛丽·达利（Mary Daly）呼吁该市的科技创业者在中空的办公室中迎回员工，以避免经济“灾难循环”并复兴旧金山市中心。

**办公空置和经济风险：**

旧金山的办公空置率美国主要城市中最高，达到37%，这主要是因为新冠疫情期间技术公司转向远程工作，而这些公司长期以来一直推动着该市的经济发展。联邦储备将商业房地产价值下降视为美国金融体系面临的最大风险之一。

**公私合作与复兴努力：**

达利强调了公私合作伙伴关系在复兴旧金山市中心方面的必要性，使之成为家庭和游客都喜爱的魅力之地。她鼓励科技创业者与其员工讨论必要的变化，并促进恢复线下工作。

**人工智能初创企业和经济潜力：**

达利还指出了OpenAI和Anthropic等人工智能初创企业对旧金山商业房地产市场和整体生产率的积极影响。她相信这些公司可以在解决无家可归者和药物过量死亡等社会问题的同时改善该市的经济。

**通货膨胀和货币政策：**

除了关注复兴旧金山市中心外，达利还对通货膨胀采取了鹰派立场，强调美国联邦储备致力于在不破坏经济的情况下恢复价格稳定。本月早些时候，美联储表示预计2023年只会降息一次，将借贷成本维持在5.25%至5.5%之间。

总之，玛丽·达利敦促旧金山的科技创业者让员工回归工作，作为避免经济“灾难循环”和复兴该市市中心区域的集体努力的一部分。她强调了公私合作伙伴关系的重要性，并强调了人工智能初创企业对当地经济的积极影响，同时解决了美联储对通货膨胀和货币政策的担忧。

 **San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly Urges Tech Founders to Bring Employees Back**  

Mary Daly, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, has called on technology founders in the city to bring their employees back to work amid record-high office vacancies. She emphasized that this collective effort is necessary to avoid an economic "doom loop" and regenerate downtown San Francisco.

**Office Vacancies & Economic Risks:**  
San Francisco faces the highest office vacancy rate among major US cities at n37 per cent, primarily due to a shift towards remote work during the coronavirus pandemic by tech companies that have long powered the city's economy. The Federal Reserve views this decline in commercial real estate value as one of the biggest risks facing the US financial system.

**Public-Private Partnership & Revitalization Efforts:**  
Daly highlighted the need for a public-private partnership to revive downtown San Francisco, making it an attractive place for families and visitors alike. She encourages tech founders to discuss necessary changes with their employees and promote returning to work in person.

**AI Startups & Economic Potential:**  
Daly also pointed out the positive impact of artificial intelligence start-ups, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, on San Francisco's commercial real estate market and overall productivity. She believes that these companies can help improve the city's economy while addressing social issues like homelessness and drug deaths.

**Inflation & Monetary Policy:**  
In addition to her focus on revitalizing downtown San Francisco, Daly took a hawkish stance on inflation and emphasized the US Federal Reserve's commitment to restoring price stability without disrupting the economy. The Fed signaled earlier this month that it expects to cut interest rates just once in 2023, maintaining borrowing costs at between 5.25 per cent and 5.5 per cent.

In summary, Mary Daly urges tech founders in San Francisco to bring their employees back to work as part of a collective effort to avoid an economic "doom loop" and revitalize the city's downtown area. She emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and highlights the positive impact of AI startups on the local economy, while also addressing inflation concerns and moneteary policy decisions by the US Federal Reserve.
