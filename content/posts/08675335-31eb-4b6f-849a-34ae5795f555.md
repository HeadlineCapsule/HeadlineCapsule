软银的孙正义称过去的投资只是为AI押注“热身”

**软银创始人孙正义向股东宣布，他过去的投资只是为其宏伟雄心——创造人工超级智能（ASI）的“热身”。他认为这项技术可能比人类聪明得多。**

孙正义在年度股东大会上强调，软银需要合作伙伴来支持他的愿景，其中包括人工智能机器人、数据中心和自动驾驶等机会。尽管软银愿景基金最近出现亏损，但软银现在拥有强劲的资产负债表，有数十亿美元可供投资。

今年5月，该集团首席财务官描述他们的贷款-价值水平为“诚实地说，可能太低了，太安全了”。孙正义决心追求人工智能交易，以保持公司相关性并支持其皇冠上的宝石，英国芯片设计公司Arm。

最近，软银领导了一项对自动驾驶汽车初创公司Wayve的10亿美元以上的投资，这是欧洲迄今为止最大的人工智能交易。然而，其他人敦促该集团将资本返还给股东。埃利奥特管理公司重建了可观的持股，并推动孙正义启动150亿美元的回购计划。

周五，孙正义淡化了回购问题，称他的人工智能愿景是优先事项。他还警告说，由于其市值与资产价值之间存在差距，软银未来可能会私有化。

 **Summary of Article:**  

Tech founder Masayoshi Son from SoftBank announced to shareholders that his past investments were merely a "warm-up" for his grand ambition - the creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI). He believes this technology could be significantly smarter than humans. 

Son emphasized during the annual meeting that SoftBank would need partners to support his vision, which includes opportunities in AI robotics, data centres and autonomous driving. Despite recent losses at its Vision Funds, SoftBank now has a strong balance sheet with billions of dollars available for investment.

In May, the group's CFO described their loan-to-value level as "maybe too low to be honest, too safe". Son is determined to pursue AI deals that can keep the company relevant and support its crown jewel, UK-based chip designer Arm. 

Recently, SoftBank led an investment of over $1bn in a self-driving car start-up Wayve, marking Europe's largest AI deal to date. However, others are urging the group to return capital to shareholders instead. Elliott Management has rebuilt a substantial stake and is pushing for Son to launch a $15bn share buyback.

Son downplayed the question of buybacks on Friday, stating that his AI vision was the priority. He also warned about potentially privatizing SoftBank in the future due to the gap between its market capitalization and the soaring value of its assets.
