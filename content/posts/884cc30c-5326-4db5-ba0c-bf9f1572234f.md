# 香港房地产市场陷入痛苦衰退

香港房地产市场正经历显著下行，**商业和住宅**租金及价格下滑，这是由**较高利率**、**中国经济放缓**和**新冠疫情后遗症**等多重因素造成的完美风暴所致。此次衰退导致入住率下降，空置率上升，一流写字楼租金较 2019 年高峰期下跌近 40%，空置率达创纪录的 16%。住宅市场也面临困境，**建成但未售出单元**数量激增，价格较 2021 年高峰期下跌了四分之一。

**恒基兆业地产**新建的 36 层写字楼**恒基中心**是当前挑战的一个显著例子。尽管吸引了声望租户，但目前仅 60% 的入驻率，反映了需求下降的整体趋势。

专家警告，由于多种因素的综合作用，房地产市场复苏之路可能颇为坎坷。预计**美国利率**将保持“较高水平更长时间”，这会影响香港的借贷成本，因为其**货币与美元挂钩**。此前三年**严格的防疫政策**和**政治打压**已经导致一些国际公司和居民考虑离开香港。

住宅市场也面临类似情况，未售出单元增加，价格下跌。香港的房地产开发商承受着巨大压力，股价在过去一年下跌了 15% 至 58%。分析师预测，营业利润率将从 2022 年约 40% 的峰值降至 2025 年的 19%，反映了行业面临的挑战。

香港房地产市场前景仍不确定，有人质疑价格快速反弹的可持续性。目前，焦点转向香港政府扩大**负担得起的住房**的努力，以及中国推动“共同富裕”的潜在影响。随着香港应对这些挑战，该城市作为全球金融中心的地位对其复苏和长期经济前景仍至关重要。

# The painful slump in Hong Kong property 

Hong Kong's property market is experiencing a significant downturn, with **commercial and residential** rents and prices declining amid a perfect storm of **higher interest rates**, a **slowdown in China**, and the **aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic**. This slump has led to a decrease in occupancy rates and a rise in vacancy rates, with prime office rents dropping by nearly 40% from their peak in 2019 and vacancy rates at a record high of 16%. The residential market is also struggling, with a surge in the number of **completed but unsold units** and a quarter drop in prices since their peak in 2021. 

**Henderson Land Development's** new 36-storey office building, **The Henderson**, is a notable example of the current challenges. Despite attracting prestigious tenants, it currently has only 60% occupancy, reflecting the broader trend of declining demand. 

Experts warn that a recovery in the property market may be elusive this time, given the combination of factors at play. **US interest rates** are expected to remain "higher for longer," impacting borrowing costs in Hong Kong due to its **currency peg to the dollar**. This comes on the heels of three years of **strict Covid-19 policies** and a **political crackdown** that has prompted some international companies and residents to consider leaving the city. 

The situation is similar in the residential market, with a rise in unsold units and declining prices. Hong Kong's property developers are feeling the squeeze, with share prices falling between 15% and 58% over the past year. Analysts predict that operating profit margins will drop to 19% in 2025 from a peak of about 40% in 2022, reflecting the challenges facing the industry. 

The future of Hong Kong's property market remains uncertain, with some questioning the sustainability of a rapid rebound in prices. The focus now shifts to the government's efforts to expand **affordable housing** and the potential impact of China's drive for "common prosperity." As Hong Kong navigates these challenges, the city's position as a global financial hub remains crucial to its recovery and long-term economic prospects.
