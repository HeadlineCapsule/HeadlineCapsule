珍妮特·耶伦警告以色列不要取消对巴勒斯坦银行的豁免权

## 美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦警告以色列不要取消一项豁免，该豁免允许巴勒斯坦银行与以色列金融机构保持联系。

 ## 摘要： 
 **美国财政部长珍妮特•耶伦（Janet Yellen）**警告以色列不要取消一项将于7月1日到期的**豁免**，此豁免允许巴勒斯坦银行维持与以色列金融机构的往来。该豁免便利了约80亿美元从以色列进口商品的支付，并使被占领的西岸地区的企业能够出口价值约20亿美元的商品。耶伦表示关切的是，切断这些联系将严重影响巴勒斯坦经济和基本服务。七国集团财政部长即将举行的会议将讨论这一问题，美国官员敦促以色列采取措施，加强巴勒斯坦经济和以色列安全。

## 有趣的问题： 
 **Q1: 如果豁免被取消，会对西岸经济有何影响？** 
**A1:** 若豁免被取消，将扰乱从以色列进口约80亿美元商品的付款，并阻碍被占领的西岸地区企业出口价值约20亿美元的商品。这可能会导致该地区经济显著下滑，影响电力和供水、食品供应等重要公用事业以及整体稳定。

**Q2: 该豁免如何影响以色列的安全利益？** 
**A2:** 该豁免通过维持西岸的经济稳定间接支持了以色列的安全。稳定的经济可以减轻紧张局势和暴力，这最终有利于巴勒斯坦人和以色列人双方。人们认为，通过此豁免加强巴勒斯坦经济将对地区安全产生积极影响。 

**Q3: 为维持该豁免而做出了哪些外交努力？** 
**A3:** 美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦和七国集团其他财长计划在即将举行的会议上讨论这个问题，预计“其他国家也会表达对取消豁免决定的影响的关切”。美国还致力于与以色列及其伙伴进行外交接触，以增加对加沙巴勒斯坦人的人道主义援助、减少西岸的暴力行为并稳定该地区经济。

## Summary:
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has **warned Israel** against cancelling a waiver that allows Palestinian banks to maintain ties with Israeli financial institutions. The waiver, which is set to expire on July 1st, facilitates payments for $8 billion worth of imports from Israel and enables about $2 billion worth of exports by businesses in the occupied West Bank. Yellen expressed concern that cutting off these ties would have severe consequences for the Palestinian economy and essential services. The issue will be discussed at an upcoming meeting of G7 finance ministers, with US officials urging Israel to take actions that bolster both the Palestinian economy and Israeli security.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: What are the potential consequences for the West Bank's economy if the waiver is cancelled?
A1: If the waiver is cancelled, it would disrupt payments for $8 billion worth of imports from Israel and hinder about $n2 billion worth of exports by businesses in the occupied West Bank. This could lead to a significant economic downturn in the region, affecting vital utilities such as electricity and water, food supplies, and overall stability.

Q2: How does the waiver impact Israel's security interests?
A2: The waiver indirectly supports Israeli security by maintaining economic stability in the West Bank. A stable economy can reduce tensions and violence, which ultimately benefits both Palestinians and Israelis. By bolstering the Palestinian economy through this waiver, it is believed that there will be a positive impact on regional security.

Q3: What diplomatic efforts are being made to keep the waiver in place?
A3: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other G7 finance ministers plan to discuss the issue at an upcoming meeting, with the expectation that "other countries will express concern about the impact of the decision" to cancel the waiver. The United States is also committed to working diplomatically with Israel and its partners to increase humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, curtail violence in the West Bank, and stabilize the region's economy.
