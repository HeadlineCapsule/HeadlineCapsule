市场不能一直无视特朗普的连任竞选。

# 投资者不能忽视特朗普寻求连任及其对市场的影响，尤其是财政政策和移民问题。

## 关键问题：

1. 政府无限制支出可能如何影响美国国债的稳定性，以及对全球金融市场有何潜在后果？
   - 答案：无限制的政府支出可能导致公共债务水平上升，从而降低投资者对美国国债的信心。这可能会导致债券价格下跌和收益率（利率）上升，使美国政府借贷成本增加。对全球金融市场的潜在影响包括波动性增加，因为许多国际资产以美元计价或作为基准，从而对其他经济体和资产类别产生连锁反应。

2. 移民如何影响美国的工资需求和通货膨胀水平？
   - 答案：移民可以增加劳动力供应，帮助缓解工资压力，为雇主提供更多选择。求职者之间的竞争加剧可能导致工资增长放缓甚至工资抑制。这有助于控制通货膨胀，因为企业不太可能通过提价将更高的劳动力成本转嫁给消费者。文章表明，移民可能根据美联储的首选衡量标准将核心通胀率降低了半个百分点。

3. 特朗普和拜登在移民问题上的立场差异可能对美国市场产生什么影响，尤其是股票价格和利率？
   - 答案：特朗普和拜登在移民问题上的不同立场可能会给投资者带来不确定性，影响财政政策的未来方向。如果候选人中有人对移民政策进行重大改变，可能会影响劳动力供应、工资水平、通货膨胀预期和最终利率。例如，如果收紧移民政策，劳动力短缺可能导致工资上涨，从而加剧通货膨胀压力，促使美联储提高利率。这种情况可能会对股票价格产生负面影响，因为投资者预计经济增长放缓和货币政策收紧。相反，更开放的移民政策可以帮助维持较低的工资增长和通货膨胀水平，在短期内可能支持更高的股票估值，但长期则引起劳动力市场动态的担忧。

**Summary:** 
The article discusses how investors cannot ignore US President Donald Trump's bid for re-election and its potential impact on markets, particularly regarding fiscal policy and immigration. The stakes of US fiscal policy are high due to unchecked government spending that could harm the stability of US government bonds. Immigration is highlighted as a key factor affecting the economy, with Trump's campaign rhetamoan suggesting mass deportations while Biden faces pressure from Democrats on border issues. The article emphasizes that politics will become increasingly relevant for investors in the lead-up to the 2024 US election.

**Interesting Questions:**
1. Q: How might unchecked government spending impact the stability of US government bonds, and what are potential consequences for global financial markets?
   A: Unchecked government spending could lead to an increase in public debt levels, which may result in a decrease in investor confidence in US government bonds. This can cause bond prices to fall and yields (interest rates) to rise, making borrowing more expensive for the US government. The potential consequences for global financial markets include increased volatility, as many international assets are benchmarked against or denominated in US dollars, leading to a ripple effect on other economies and asset classes.
   
2. Q: How does immigration affect wage demands and inflation levels within the US economy?
   A: Immigration can increase the labor supply, which may help ease pressure on wages by providing more workers for employers to choose from. This increased competition among job seekers could lead to lower wage growth or even suppressed wage increases. In turn, this helps keep inflation levels in check as businesses are less likely to pass higher labor costs onto consumers through price hikes. The article suggests that immigration may have helped reduce core inflation by up to half a percentage point on the Federal Reserve's preferred measure.
   
3. Q: What potential impact could differing stances on immigration between Trump and Biden have on US markets, particularly in relation to stock prices and interest rates?
   A: Differing stances on immigration by Trump and Biden can create uncertainty for investors regarding the future direction of fiscal policy. If either candidate were to implement significant changes to immigration policies, it could affect labor supply, wage levels, inflation expectations, and ultimately interest rates. For example, a crackdown on immigration may lead to higher wages due to reduced labor availability, which can fuel inflationary pressures and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. This scenario might negatively impact stock prices as investors anticipate slower economic growth and tighter monetamoan conditions. Conversely, a more open immigration policy could help maintain lower wage growth and inflation levels, potentially supporting higher stock valuations in the short term but raising concerns about long-term labor market dynamics.
