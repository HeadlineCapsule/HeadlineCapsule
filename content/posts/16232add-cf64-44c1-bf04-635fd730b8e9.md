工党计划迫使科技巨头赔偿在线欺诈受害者

# 工党提议由科技巨头赔偿在线欺诈受害者

工党起草了计划，要求科技公司赔偿在线欺诈的受害者，将负担从银行转移到金融行业，引发争议。该提案旨在解决授权推送支付（APP）欺诈问题，即受害者被骗通过其银行账户向欺诈者汇款。

**要点：**
- 根据《金融时报》看到的一份文件，工党批评“大科技公司”在打击在线欺诈和赔偿受害者方面贡献很小。
- 该提案建议银行应继续退还欺诈受害者的资金，但可以根据提交给监督机构的证据从科技公司追回部分资金。
- 工党正在考虑扩大《经济犯罪法案》，以将科技公司未能防止其平台上的欺诈行为定为犯罪。
- 该计划标志着从支付系统监管局（PSR）的决定中转移了重点，该决定要求银行从10月开始为价值高达41.5万英镑的索赔向受害者提供赔偿。

**反应：**
- 银行认为，让科技公司贡献资金将鼓励他们最初阻止欺诈行为蓬勃发展。英国金融业批评PSR规则可能会让欺诈者冒充受害者以获得赔偿金。
- 代表谷歌和亚马逊等公司的TechUK表示，科技公司已经实施了先进的措施来打击在线欺诈，并致力于与参与打击这一犯罪活动的所有合作伙伴合作。

**结论：**
工党的提案旨在通过让大科技公司对促进此类犯罪负责来解决APP欺诈日益严重的问题，同时考虑扩大立法以进一步阻止在线欺诈活动。

 **Labour Party Proposes Tech Giants Compensate Online Fraud Victims**

The Labour party has drafted plans that would require tech companies to compensate victims of online fraud, shifting the burden from banks and sparking controversy within the financial sector. The proposal aims to address authorized push payment (APP) fraud where victims are tricked into sending money to fraudsters through their bank accounts.

**Key Points:**
- Labour criticizes "big tech companies" for contributing very little towards tackling online fraud and compensating victims, as per a document seen by the Financial Times.
- The proposal suggests that banks should still refund fraud victims but could later recoup some money from tech companies based on evidence submitted to an oversight body.
- Labour is considering expanding the Economic Crime Act to create the offense of failure by a tech company to prevent fraud on their platform.
- The plan marks a shift from the Payment System Regulator'culed (PSR) decision, which forces banks to reimburse victims for claims worth up to £415,000 starting in October.

**Reactions:**
- Banks argue that making tech companies contribute would give them an incentive to stop fraud from flourishing initially. UK Finance has criticized the PSR rules as they risk emboldening fraudsters to pose as victims for compensation money.
- TechUK, representing companies like Google and Amazon, states that tech companies have implemented sophisticated measures to tackle online fraud and are committed to working with all partners involved in fighting this criminal activity.

**Conclusion:**
Labour's proposal aims to address the growing issue of APP fraud by holding big tech companies accountable for their role in facilitating such crimes, while also considering expanding legislation to further deter online fraudulent activities.
