# 失控的政府补贴

**补贴**，无论出于环境还是经济原因，可能有利也有弊。如果没有得到妥善控制，它们可能会产生负面影响。本文探讨了在全球范围内有效管理**补贴**所面临的挑战。 

/***/

**美国拜登总统最近对中国电动汽车、太阳能电池板和电池征收关税，凸显了政府补贴扭曲贸易的问题**。拜登对中国**补贴**的回应包括他自己通过《通胀削减法案》提供的补贴，这反映了**补贴**日益增长的政治意义。虽然有正当理由要补贴**绿色技术**，但缺乏强有力的国际规则来区分有益和浪费的**补贴**，这令人担忧。 

/***/

根据世界贸易组织（WTO）的定义，**补贴**是指政府或公共机构为特定目的提供的财政贡献。然而，这个概念可能模棱两可，关于减少化石燃料**补贴**的辩论导致世贸组织和经合组织等机构之间存在分歧，而国际货币基金组织（IMF）则提倡一个更广泛的定义，其中包括“隐性**补贴**”。这种差异造成了混乱，使制定有效政策变得困难。 

/***/

衡量**补贴**也具有挑战性，特别是在中国等国，该国政府与私营部门之间的界限模糊。世贸组织的争端解决体系对构成“公共机构”的范围有着狭隘的解释，这进一步加大了量化**补贴**影响的难度。 

/***/

约束**补贴**制度同样困难重重。世贸组织框架在欧盟和美国之间的诉讼中取得了一些成功，但在涉及中国时效果则不尽如人意。各国常常诉诸于单边行动，例如反补贴关税，而扩大多边规则的尝试基本宣告失败。作为一项独立倡议，《维拉尔框架协议》提出了改革建议，但要想在这类根本性变革上达成共识，难度很大。 

/***/

总而言之，尽管人们一致认同**补贴**的重要性及其可能造成的破坏，但在**补贴**的定义、衡量和管理方面仍缺乏共识。全球治理的挑战凸显出需要采取综合办法来解决这一关键问题。

# The state handouts that get out of control

**Subsidies**, whether for environmental or economic reasons, can be beneficial, but when they are not properly controlled, they can have negative consequences. This article examines the challenges in managing **subsidies** effectively on a global scale. 

/***/

**US President Joe Biden's recent imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries highlights the issue of government subsidies distorting trade**. Biden's response to Chinese **subsidies** includes his own handouts through the Inflation Reduction Act, reflecting the increasing political significance of **subsidies**. While there are valid reasons to subsidize **green technology**, the lack of robust international rules to distinguish between beneficial and wasteful **subsidies** is concerning. 

/***/

The definition of a **subsidy**, according to the World Trade Organization (WTO), is a financial contribution by a government or public body for a specific purpose. However, the concept can be ambiguous, and debates around reducing **subsidies** for fossil fuels have led to disagreements between institutions like the WTO and OECD, and the IMF, which promotes a broader definition that includes "implicit **subsidies**." This discrepancy causes confusion and makes it challenging to develop effective policies. 

/***/

Measuring **subsidies** is also challenging, especially in countries like China, where the line between the government and private sector is blurred. The WTO's dispute settlement system has taken a narrow view of what constitutes a "public body," further complicating efforts to quantify the impact of **subsidies**. 

/***/

Disciplining **subsidy** regimes is equally difficult. While the WTO framework has had some success in litigations between the EU and the US, it has been less effective with China. Unilateral actions, such as anti-subsidy duties, are often resorted to, and attempts to expand multilateral rules have largely failed. The Villars Framework, an independent initiative, proposes reform, but consensus on such fundamental changes is unlikely. 

/***/

In summary, while there is agreement on the importance of **subsidies** and their potential for destruction, there is a lack of consensus on their definition, measurement, and management. The challenges in global governance highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing this critical issue.
