波音和空中客车购买了带有虚假认证金属的飞机部件。

# 文章摘要：飞机中虚假认证的钛金属引发波音和空客的安全担忧

波音和空客最近承认，他们在飞机中使用了来自中国的**虚假认证钛金属**制造的部件。美国航空安全监管机构正在调查这一问题的范围和影响，该问题源于伪造文件的钛金属。两家制造商都保证，含有这些部件的飞机可以安全运行。

受影响的组件包括来自堪萨斯州供应商Spirit AeroSystems提供的机身和机翼，该公司在过去一年中面临质量问题。**虚假认证的钛金属**通过全球供应链流入波音和空客制造的喷气式飞机中。这一消息对一个订单积压、客户急切期待新飞机的行业来说是又一次打击。

钛对于制造飞机部件至关重要，如起落架、紧固件和将发动机连接到机翼的发动机吊舱。涉及**虚假认证钛金属**的交易可能早在2019年就开始了。波音表示，它将从等待交付的飞机中移除这些部件，但不会暂停交付或停飞在役机队。

在早些时候的一次商业航班上发生门板爆炸事件后，波音和Spirit AeroSystems正受到监管机构的审查，这导致美国联邦航空管理局（FAA）承认其之前对波音的监管方式“过于放任”。FAA目前正在调查**虚假认证钛金属**问题的范围和影响。

波音拒绝具体说明哪些飞机受到了这些部件的影响，而空客表示，对来自同一来源的部件进行的多次测试表明，其A220系列飞机的适航性保持完好。Spirit已经从生产中移除了所有可疑部件，并完成了1000多项测试，确认材料的机械和冶金性能以确保安全。

在波音自愿报告问题后，FAA正在调查此事，声明称“使用了正确的钛合金”，尽管文件被伪造。波音购买的大部分钛金属未受到此次**伪造文件**问题的影响。

 # Article Summary: Falsely Certified Titanium in Planes Raises Safety Concerns for Boeing and Airbus

Boeing and Airbus have recently acknowledged that they included parts made with falsely certified titanium from China in their aircraft. The **US air safety regulators** are investigating the scope and impact of this issue, which originated with titanium whose documentation was counterfeited. Both manufacturers assured that planes containing these parts were safe for operation.

The affected components include fuselages and wings sourced from Spirit AeroSystems, a Kansas-based supplier facing quality issues over the past year. The falsified titanium made its way through the global supply chain to be used in jets manufactured by Boeing and Airbus. This news comes as another setback for an industry with a backlog of orders and customers eagerly awaiting new planes.

Titanium is crucial for making aircraft components such as landing gears, fasteners, and engine pylons that attach engines to wings. The transactions involving the falsely certified titanium may have occurred as far back as 2019. Boeing has stated it will remove these parts from planes awaiting delivery but not pause deliveries or ground in-service fleets.

Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are under scrutiny by regulators following a door panel blowout during a commercial flight earlier this year, which led to the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) admitting its previous approach to regulating Boeing was "too hands-off." The FAA is now investigating the scope and impact of the falsely certified titanium issue.

Boeing declined to specify which aircraft were affected by these parts, while Airbus stated that numerous tests on parts from the same source showed their A22n0's airworthiness remains intact. Spirit has removed all suspect parts from production and completed over 1,000 tests confirming the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material to ensure safety.

The FAA is investigating the issue after Boeing voluntarily reported it, stating that "the correct titanium alloy was used" despite falsified documentation. The majority of titanium purchased by Boeing remains unaffected by this counterfeit documentation problem.
