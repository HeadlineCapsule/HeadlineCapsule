因好莱坞限片，VUE 进军发行领域

**Vue International** 是一家欧洲最大的私营影院运营商，由于好莱坞罢工导致供给有限，该公司正在冒险进入电影发行领域。上个月，该公司在英国设立了分销部门，并在戛纳电影节期间宣布与英国制片人安迪·帕特森和安纳丽丝·戴维斯以及虚拟制作公司Dimension Studio合作。

**首席执行官蒂姆·理查兹** 表示，好莱坞罢工导致的供给问题影响了电影在Vue银幕上的上映，这促使该公司采取了这一行动。该发行部门旨在将其英国、外国和独立电影推向自己的银幕以及竞争对手的银幕。

Vue计划将发行业务扩展到欧洲大陆，并正在为这项新业务招聘人员。这次举措使Vue能够在经历好莱坞罢工导致的供给有限之后更好地控制电影内容。该公司在英国、爱尔兰、德国和意大利等8个国家/地区经营着220家场所。

今年早些时候，Vue首次发行的电影是意大利喜剧剧情片《There's Still Tomorrow》。其他影院连锁，如AMC，也在扩大他们的发行业务，因为在泰勒·斯威夫特：The Eras Tour和Beyoncé的Renaissance：A Film中取得了成功。

Vue在建立预测性人工智能模型方面的8年经验可以帮助确定在特定银幕上放映哪些电影，这将使该发行部门在将电影与特定影院匹配时具有优势。这项技术使Vue能够根据需求调整时间表，每周放映的电影数量多于竞争对手。

总之，**Vue International** 由于好莱坞罢工导致的供给有限而进入电影发行领域，并希望更好地控制在欧洲各地影院放映的内容。该公司对预测性人工智能技术的应用将在匹配电影与特定受众方面发挥关键作用，使Vue在新业务中具有竞争优势。

 **Vue International**, Europe's largest privately owned cinema operator, is venturing into film distribution due to limited supply caused by Hollywood strikes. The company established a UK-based distribution arm last month and announced partnerships with UK producers Andy Paterson and Annalise Davis, as well as virtual production company Dimension Studio during the Cannes Film Festival.

**Chief Executive Tim Richards** stated that this move was prompted by supply issues resulting from Hollywood strikes affecting movie availability for Vue's screens. The distribution arm aims to roll out British, foreign, and independent films on its own screens as well as those of rivals.

Vue plans to expand the distribution business into continental Europe and is currently hiring staff for this new venture. This move allows Vue greater control over film content after experiencing limited supply due to Hollywood strikes. The company operates 220 sites in eight countries, including the UK, Ireland, Germany, and Italy.

The first attempt at distributing a movie by Vue was Italian dramedy **There's Still Tomorrow** earlier this year. Other cinema chains like AMC are also expanding their distribution businesses following success with concert films such as Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour and Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé.

Vue's eight-year experience in building a predictive artificial intelligence model to determine which films to show on specific screens will give the distribution arm an advantage in matching movies with particular cinemas. This technology allows Vue to adjust scheduling based on demand, resulting in more films being screened each week compared to competitors.

In conclusion, **Vue International** is moving into film distribution as a response to limited supply caused by Hollywood strikes and aims to gain greater control over the content shown at its cinemas across Europe. The company's use of predictive artificial intelligence technology will play a crucial role in matching films with specific audiencuences, providing Vue with an edge over competitors in this new venture.
