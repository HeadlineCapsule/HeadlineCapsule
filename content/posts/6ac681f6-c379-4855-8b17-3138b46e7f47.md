《经济学人》读者谈律师的丰厚薪酬

# 文章重点介绍了阿拉斯加 800 亿美元主权财富基金的重大治理争议，涉及亿万富翁大卫·鲁宾斯坦的女儿加布里埃尔·鲁宾斯坦。她在管理阿拉斯加永久基金公司（APFC）受托人董事会期间被指控试图将州资产转移到朋友和家人手中。这场争议引发了对 APFC 管理石油资源资金方向的担忧，这些资金支持阿拉斯加各种公共服务。

争议还涉及对鲁宾斯坦的指控，即她试图解雇一位让她父亲“印象不深”的初级员工。作为回应，鲁宾斯坦的发言人克里斯·乌尔曼承认她介绍了约 20 名外部资产管理人，但声称她遵循了规则，并没有施加不当压力。

文章还讨论了私募股权回报现金困难如何影响对冲基金的情况，因为两者都属于机构投资者的“替代品”类别。来自私募市场投资组合的缺乏分配影响了做出其他替代投资（包括对冲基金）新承诺的能力。

此外，文章还涉及各种新闻事件，例如埃克森美孚、雪佛龙和赫斯公司竞争圭亚那 110 亿桶石油和天然气项目；沙奎尔·奥尼尔重金投资里伯克重返体育领域；以及阿布扎比综合企业开展采矿交易。

总之，文章涉及阿拉斯加主权财富基金的治理问题，其中涉及加布里埃尔·鲁宾斯坦，以及私募股权困境对对冲基金等更广泛的话题和其他金融领域新闻事件的影响。

The article highlights a significant governance dispute at Alaska's $80bn sovereign wealth fund, involving Gabrielle Rubenstein, daughter of billionaire David Rubenstein. She is accused of trying to steer state assets towards friends and family members while managing the board of trustees for the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC). The controversy has raised concerns about the direction of APFC's management of oil resources funds, which support various public services in Alaska.

The dispute also involves allegations that Rubenstein sought to dismiss a junior employee who left her father "unimpressed." In response, Chris Ullman, a spokespader for Rubenstein, acknowledged she made about 20 referrals of external asset managers but claimed she followed the rules and did not exert improper pressure.

The article also discusses how private equity's struggle to return cash is affecting hedge funds, as both fall into institutional investors' "alternatives" bucket. The lack of distributions from private markets portfolios has impacted the ability to make new commitments in other parts of the alternatives portfolio, including hedge funds.

Additionally, the article covers various news items such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Hess competing over a 11bn barrels oil and gas project in Guyana; Shaquille O'Neal investing heavily in Reebok's return to sports; and Abu Dhabi conglomerate embarking on mining deals.

In summary, the article covers governance issues at Alaska's sovereign wealth fund involving Gabrielle Rubenstein, as well as broader topics such as private equity struggles impacting hedge funds and other news items in the financial world.
