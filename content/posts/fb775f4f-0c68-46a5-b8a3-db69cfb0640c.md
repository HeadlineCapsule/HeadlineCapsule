游戏驿站利用其咆哮小猫聚光灯来建立现金储备

**游戏零售商GameStop的现金储备与业务衰退**

尽管面临着销售下滑和门店数量减少等挑战，但视频游戏零售商GameStop因其巨大的现金储备而成为关注的焦点。该公司利用了近期股价上涨的机会，将归功于社交媒体影响力人物Roaring Kitty（Keith Gill）的回归，通过出售4500万股股票筹集了9.33亿美元。他们还通知投资者，可能还会出售多达7500万股股票，价值约19亿美元。

GameStop的电子商务战略举步维艰，随着移动游戏应用程序的兴起，其业务模式受到影响，该模式依赖于数千家实体店。该公司没有回应关于其20亿美元现金储备计划的要求。

股价最近的跳涨是由于Keith Gill的重新出现以及他对GameStop首席执行官Ryan Cohen转型愿景的信心。然而，自那时以来，股价从上个月的高点下跌了50%。尽管人们期待在Cohen的领导下成为电子商务强势企业，但该公司尚未取得这种进展。

GameStop报告截至5月4日的第一季度净销售额下降29%，并在最新股票出售之前持有超过10亿美元的现金和可转让证券。关于GameStop现金储备用途的猜测包括潜在的收购或投资，但到目前为止，他们一直专注于持有储备或购买低风险证券，例如短期政府债券。

该公司已关闭两个仓库，并将美国总门店数量减少到4169家，自2023年以来，每家商店的平均访问量一直在下降。GameStop的现金储备尚未用于重大资本支出或收购，因为他们继续应对业务衰退和不断变化的市场环境。

 **GameStop's Cash Hoard Amidst Declining Operations**

The video game retailer GameStop has been in the spotlight due to its significant cash reserves, despite facing challenges such as declining sales and shrinking store count. The company capitalized on a recent surge in share value, attributed to the return of social media influencer Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill), by selling 45 million shares and raising $933 million. They also alerted investors about another potential sale of up to 75 million shares worth approximately $1.9 billion.

GameStop's ecommerce strategy has struggled, with sales in a multiyear slide as the rise of mobile gaming apps undercut their business model anchored by thousands of physical stores. The company did not respond to requests for comment on its plans for the cash hoard, which stands at $2 billion.

The stock's latest leap followed Keith Gill's reappearance and his belief in GameStop'ebox CEO Ryan Cohen's vision for transformation. However, since then, shares have been plummeting by half from their peak last month. Despite expectations of becoming an ecommerce powerhouse under Cohen's leadership, the company has yet to materialize such progress.

GameStop reported a 29% decline in net sales for the first quarter ending May 4th and held more than $1 billion in cash and marketable securities prior to the latest stock sale. Speculation on the use of GameStop's cash pile includes potential acquisitions or investments, but so far, they have focused on holding onto their reserves or purchasing low-risk securities such as short-term government bonds.

The company has closed two warehouses and reduced its total store count to 4,169 stores in the US, with a decreasing number of average visits per store since 2023. GameStop's cash hoard remains unutilized for major capital outlays or acquisitions as they continue to navigate their declining operations and changing market landscape.
