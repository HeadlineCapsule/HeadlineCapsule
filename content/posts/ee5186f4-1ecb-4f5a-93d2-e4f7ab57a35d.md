投资者追逐收益，绿色债券发行量激增

# 摘要：
今年，绿色债券发行额达到创纪录的水平，一季度筹集资金**2730亿美元**，因为投资者寻求收益和环保资质。可持续债务的需求受到高利率和“绿溢价”侵蚀的驱动，这使投资者能够在不牺牲回报的情况下获得类似的收益。

美国是第一季度绿色债券最大的单一国家来源，发行额达到**276亿美元**。象牙海岸等新兴市场也增加了可持续债务的挂牌。然而，由于表现不佳和丑闻，ESG股票基金面临资金外流。

尽管与过去相比，绿溢价折扣较小，但绿色债券对发行人仍然具有吸引力。它们表明了向低碳经济转型和应对气候变化的坚定承诺。尽管可持续性挂钩债券（SLB）受到批评，但预计使用收益的绿色债券将继续增长，因为高排放行业的公司为去碳化项目提供资金。

# 要点：

1. 2024年第一季度，通过可持续债务发行（包括绿色、社会和可持续性挂钩债券）筹集了**2730亿美元**。
2. 绿色债券发行额跳涨43%，达到**1959亿美元**；预计今年总发行额将达到**1万亿美元**。
3. 美国是最大的单一国家来源，绿色债券发行额为**276亿美元**；自2017年以来，象牙海岸首次发行美元债务。
4. 由于表现不佳和丑闻，ESG股票基金面临资金外流；然而，可持续债务对发行人仍然具有吸引力。
5. 可持续性挂钩债券（SLB）受到批评，但使用收益的绿色债券预计将增长，因为公司为去碳化项目提供资金。

 # Summary:
Green bond issuance has reached a record level this year with **$273 billion** raised in Q1, as investors seek yield and environmental credentials. The demand for sustainable debt is driven by high interest rates and the erosion of the "greenium," which allows investors to obtain similar yields without sacrificing returns.

The US was the largest single-country source of green bonds in Q1, with **$27.n6 billion** issued. Emerging markets like Ivory Coast have also increased their sustainable debt listings. However, ESG stock funds face outflows due to poor performance and scandals.

Green bonds remain attractive for issuers despite a smaller greenium discount compared to the past. They signal serious commitment towards transitioning and climate change efforts. Sustainability-linked bonds (SLB) have faced criticism, but use-of-proceeds green bonds are expected to continue growing as companies in high-emitting sectors finance decarbonization projects.

# Key Points:
1. **$273 billion** raised through sustainable debt issuance in Q1 2024, including green, social, and sustainability-linked bonds.
2. Green bond issuance jumped by 43% to **$195.9 billion**; predicted to reach a total of **$1 trillion** this year.
3. US was the largest single-country source with **$27.6 billion** in green bonds, while Ivory Coast issued its first dollar-denominated liability since 2017.
4. ESG stock funds face outflows due to poor performance and scandals; however, sustainable debt remains attractive for issuers.
5. Sustainability-linked bonds (SLB) have faced criticism but use-of-proceeds green bonds are expected to grow as companies finance decarbonization projects.
