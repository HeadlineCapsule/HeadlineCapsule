乌克兰恳求西方援助以恢复电力供应

# 西方对乌克兰能源部门的援助

乌克兰领导人沃洛德米尔·泽连斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskyy）呼吁西方伙伴提供数十亿美元的援助，以恢复该国的能源部门。由于俄罗斯的空袭，乌克兰一半的电力生成能力被摧毁，去年冬天峰值消耗为18千兆瓦（GW），现在减少到9GW。

柏林正在举行的会议旨在为重建因俄罗斯入侵乌克兰而受损的城市和基础设施争取支持。世界银行估计，未来十年将需要近5000亿美元用于重建工作，能源是主要重点。官员们担心，由于3月以来对能源基础设施的持续攻击，今年的气温降至冰点以下时，居民可能会面临停电。

乌克兰最大的私营能源供应商DTEK受到俄罗斯轰炸的严重影响，其热能发电能力损失了90%。该公司正在寻找扩大电力进口能力的方法，并从邻国购买旧变压器和发电机，以便在乌克兰迅速部署。此外，DTEK还旨在采购开放循环煤气轮机等新设备，并确保信贷额度用于紧急维修工作。

然而，如果没有足够的防空能力来抵御俄罗斯的攻击，重建工作可能徒劳无功。由于捐赠支持集中在国有企业上，像DTEK这样的私营公司也处于劣势。欧洲复兴开发银行（EBRD）宣布为乌克兰能源部门提供3亿欧元的额外资金，这将用于修复发电厂、建造新的发电厂以及确保稳定的电力供应。

总之，在俄罗斯持续攻击的背景下，乌克兰领导人正在寻求西方援助来恢复该国受损的能源部门。重点仍然是扩大进口能力，采购设备，确保资金用于紧急维修工作，同时解决防空问题。

 # Summary of Article: Western Aid for Ukraine's Energy Sector Restoration

The Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has called upon western partners to provide billions in aid to restore the country's energy sector. Due to Russian air strikes, half of Ukraine's electricity generating capacity has been destroyed, with peak consumption last winter at 18 gigawatts (GW) and now reduced to 9 GW.

The ongoing conference in Berlin aims to garner support for rebuilding cities and infrastructure damaged by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The World Bank estimates that nearly $500 billion will be required over the next ten years for reconstruction efforts, with energy being the primary focus. Officials fear residents may face power outages as temperatures drop below freezing later this year due to continued attacks on energy infrastructure since March.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy provider, has been severely affected by Russian bombardment, losing 90% of its thermal generation capacity. The company is seeking ways to expand electricity import capacity and purchase old transformers and generators from neighboring countries for quick deployment in Ukraine. Additionally, DTEK aims to acquire new equipment such as open-cycle gas turbebines and secure credit lines for urgent repair work.

However, the reconstruction efforts may be futile without adequate air defense against Russian attacks. Private companies like DTEK are also at a disadvantage due to donor support being focused on state-owned enterprises. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has announced an additional €300 million in funding for Ukraine's energy sector, which will be used for repairing power plants, constructing new ones, and ensuring a stable electricity supply.

In conclusion, the Ukrainian leader is seeking western aid to restore the country's battered energy sector amidst ongoing Russian attacks. The focus remains on expanding import capacity, acquiring equipment, and securing funding for urgent repair work while addressing air defense concerns.
