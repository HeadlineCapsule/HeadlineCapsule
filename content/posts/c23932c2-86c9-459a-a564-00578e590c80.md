# 美国躲在电动汽车关税墙后面

**乔·拜登**政府宣布对**电动汽车**征收关税，这一举动象征意义大于实质意义。预计该关税将对美国电动汽车市场产生极小的影响，因为中国商品已经受到现有关税的限制，并被排除在**《通胀削减法案》**的电动汽车税收优惠范围之外。真正令人担忧的是，中国公司可能会通过墨西哥将电动汽车进口到美国，从而规避这些关税。这符合拜登政府的一系列**保护主义**措施，包括将钢铁关税提高两倍，这些措施同样针对的是一些已经面临重大障碍、难以进入美国市场的产品。

利用**第301条款**来征收这些关税也是值得质疑的，因为该条款旨在应对不公平待遇的具体情况，而不是作为贸易报复的广泛工具。关税背后的政治算计颇为有趣，表明政府更重视保护主义的象征意义，而不是潜在的中国报复风险。考虑到中国电动汽车在美国的市场份额已经很低，这一点尤其值得注意。

文章还讨论了欧盟对中国在中欧影响力的应对，特别聚焦于匈牙利总理**欧尔班·维克托**与中国和俄罗斯的关系。文章认为，尽管欧尔班摆出姿态，但其主要动机是经济利益，而不是真正的意识形态承诺，他的行为不会对欧盟的团结构成严重威胁。然而，欧盟在应对欧洲接受中国政府补贴的电动汽车工厂时面临两难境地，一方面要重视绿色经济，另一方面又希望保护欧洲制造商。

# US is skulking behind EV tariff walls

**Joe Biden's** administration has announced tariffs on **electric vehicles (EVs)**, a move that is largely seen as symbolic rather than substantive. The tariffs are expected to have minimal impact on the US EV market, as Chinese goods are already subject to existing tariffs and are excluded from the **Inflation Reduction Act's** EV tax breaks. The real concern is the potential for Chinese companies to circumvent these tariffs by importing EVs into the US through Mexico. This follows a pattern of **protectionist** measures by the Biden administration, including the tripling of steel tariffs, which similarly target a product that already faces significant barriers to entry into the US market. 

The use of **Section 301** provisions to impose these tariffs is also questionable, as they were designed to counter specific instances of unfair treatment rather than as a broad tool for trade retaliation. The political calculation behind the tariffs is interesting, as it suggests that the administration values symbolic gestures of protectionism over the potential risks of retaliation from China. This is especially notable given the already low market share of Chinese EVs in the US. 

The article also discusses the EU's response to Chinese influence in Eastern Europe, particularly Hungarian Prime Minister **Viktor Orbán's** relationship with China and Russia. Despite Orbán's posturing, the author argues that his primary motivation is financial gain rather than a genuine ideological commitment, and that his actions do not pose a serious threat to the EU's unity. However, the EU faces a dilemma regarding its response to state-subsidized Chinese EV factories in Europe, weighing the importance of greening its economy against its desire to protect European manufacturers.
