公司削减了4000亿美元美国垃圾债的借贷成本

# 公司削减4000亿美元美国垃圾贷款的借贷成本

这篇文章讨论了**美国公司**如何能够在2023年降低近**4000亿美元债务**的利率，因为投资者对**垃圾贷款**的需求激增。这导致融资条件放松，甚至在美联储从23年的高位下调利率之前。

关键点包括：

1. 根据高盛公司策略师的说法，借款人受益于相当于美联储两次降息的待遇。
2. 重新定价交易总额为**3910亿美元**，这是该年度的纪录，占1.34万亿美元的整个杠杆贷款市场的四分之一以上。
3. 由于借款人选择在利率下调之前滚动现有债务而不是发行新债务，因此推动需求的是重新打包高风险贷款的投资工具和基金经理。
4. 高度负债的公司受益于美联储将借贷成本保持在5.25% - 5.5%的水平，以及对未来货币政策的预测在最近几个月中显著波动。
5. 值得注意的重新定价交易包括Cloud Software Group，该公司将其贷款的利率下调0.5个百分点，至高于隔夜基准利率4个百分点；以及Medline，该公司降低了其与美国 prevailing利率挂钩的利差。
6. 目前的局势被描述为一种“悖论”，即延迟的放松措施推动了银行贷款的流入，推高了价格，使借款人对重新定价更具吸引力。
7. 担保贷款（CLOs）的发行量有所增加，约占美国杠杆贷款需求的三分之二。 CLOs负责对垃圾贷款进行投资并将其打包成不同风险类别。
8. 降低成本的机会对高质量的垃圾贷款发行者来说更容易获得，而较弱的借款人从重新定价交易中受益较少。
9. 尽管最近减少了利息费用，但利率仍远高于几年前的水平，因为基准利率上升以及美国经济的总体强劲。

 # Summary of the Article: Companies slash borrowing costs on $400bn of US junk loans

The article discusses how **US companies** have been able to reduce interest rates on nearly **$400 billion worth of debt** this year due to a surge in investor demand for **junk loans**. This has resulted in an easing of financing conditions, even before the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates from their 23-year high.

Key points include:
1. Borrowers have benefited from the equivalent of two quarter-point Fed rate cuts according to Goldman Sachs strategists.
2. The repricing deals total **$391 billion**, which is a record for this time in the year and represents over a quarter of the entire leveraged loan market valued at $1.34 trillion.
3. Investment vehicles that repackage risky loans and fund managers are driving demand due to limited supply from borrowers rolling over existing debt instead of issuing new debt before rate cuts occur.
4. Highly indebted companies have seen a boost as the Fed has kept borrowing costs at 5.25% - 5.5%, and predictions about future monetary policy have fluctuated significantly in recent months.
5. Notable repricing deals include Cloud Software Group, which lowered its loan's interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4 percentage points above the overnight benchmark rate; and Medline, which reduced its spread from cuperation rates linked to prevailing US interest rates.
6. The current situation is described as a "paradox" where delayed easing has boosted inflows into bank loans, pushing prices up and making repricing attractive for borrowers.
7. Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have seen increased issuance, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand for US leveraged loans. CLOs are responsible for the surge in investment into junk loans and their packaging into different risk categories.
8. The opportunity to reduce costs has been more accessible to higher-quality junk loan issuers, while weaker borrowers have not benefited as much from repricing deals.
9. Despite recent reductions in interest expenses, rates remain significantly higher than a few years ago due to elevated base rates and the overall robustness of the US economy.
