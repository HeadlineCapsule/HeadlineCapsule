ETG 在涉及 6,000 万美元扣押的争议中威胁要进行国际仲裁

# **报告：** ## 

### **ETG在莫桑比克扣押纠纷中威胁仲裁** 

非洲商品巨头**ETG** 威胁要将莫桑比克政府告上国际仲裁，纠纷涉及价值高达6000万美元的货物被扣押。案件涉及 ETG 和当地公司 Royal Group 之间的长期竞争，可追溯到2022年，主要关于对印度的**木豆**出口，这是莫桑比克的关键贸易商品。

ETG声称，莫桑比克违反了投资法和与毛里求斯的双边条约，允许扣押其货物，其中包括大量木豆。该公司称，当局和司法部门阻碍了其解决纠纷的努力，这促使他们威胁要根据写给纽西总统政府的信寻求国际仲裁。

该争议引发了对莫桑比克**法治**状况的关注，让人回想起该国十年前的"金枪鱼债券"债务危机。ETG声称，在当局的支持下，他们的仓库被洗劫一空，法律挑战也被驳回。与此同时，皇家集团否认有任何不当行为，声称在法院裁定因竞争对手（如 ETG）据称虚假的转基因相关指控而造成的财务损失之前，他们只是在保护货物。

# **Report:** 
## **ETG Threatens Arbitration in Mozambique Seizure Dispute** 

**African commodities giant**, **ETG**, has threatened to take the government of Mozambique to international arbitration over a dispute involving the seizure of goods worth up to $60 million. The case involves a long-running rivalry between ETG and local firm Royal Group, dating back to 2022, and centers on exports of **pigeon peas** to India, a key trade commodity for Mozambique. 

ETG alleges that Mozambique has breached investment laws and a bilateral treaty with Mauritius by allowing the seizure of its goods, which included a large shipment of pigeon peas. The company claims it has faced obstructions from authorities and the judiciary in its attempts to resolve the matter domestically, prompting their threat to seek international arbitration as outlined in a letter to President Nyusi's government. 

The dispute has raised concerns about the **rule of law** in Mozambique, bringing back memories of the country's 'tuna bond' debt crisis a decade ago. ETG asserts that its warehouses are being plundered with authorities' support and that its legal challenges have been rebuffed. Meanwhile, Royal Group denies any wrongdoing, claiming it is safeguarding cargo until courts rule on financial losses incurred. 

## **Questions & Answers:** 

1. **What is the main issue in the dispute between ETG and Mozambique?** 
   - Answer: The primary issue is the seizure of goods, including a large consignment of pigeon peas, by Royal Group with the alleged support of Mozambican authorities. ETG claims this seizure breaches investment laws and a bilateral treaty, causing substantial losses for the company. 

2. **Why has this case attracted attention and what does it say about doing business in Mozambique?** 
   - Answer: The case has brought attention to the rule of law and business environment in Mozambique, especially in light of past financial scandals like the 'tuna bond' crisis. It raises questions about the ease of doing business, contract enforcement, and the treatment of foreign investors in the country. 

3. **What is the role of pigeon peas in this dispute?** 
   - Answer: Pigeon peas are a key agricultural export for Mozambique to India, where they are widely used in meals. Mozambique has privileged access to the Indian market for this commodity. The seizure of these goods by Royal Group thus impacts small-scale farmers and traders who depend on this trade for their livelihood. 

4. **What steps has ETG taken to resolve the dispute so far?** 
   - Answer: ETG has attempted legal avenues within Mozambique, but claims it has faced obstructions from authorities and the judiciary. Their letter to the government is a warning of their intent to seek international arbitration under the bilateral investment treaty with Mauritius if an amicable solution cannot be reached through talks. 

5. **How has Royal Group responded to ETG's allegations?** 
   - Answer: Royal Group denies any wrongdoing, claiming it is safeguarding cargo until courts decide on financial losses incurred by them due to allegedly false GMO-related claims made by competitors like ETG. They dispute the value of goods held and the legality of the seizure but acknowledge ongoing legal proceedings. 

6. **What are the potential implications for Mozambique if international arbitration occurs?** 
   - Answer: Should the case go to international arbitration, it could result in financial costs and damages awarded against Mozambique. It may also further damage the country's reputation as a place for doing business, potentially impacting foreign investment and trade relationships. 

This report provides an overview of the dispute between ETG and Mozambique, highlighting the key issues at play and their potential implications. The questions and answers provide additional context to enhance understanding of this complex commercial dispute with broader ramifications.
