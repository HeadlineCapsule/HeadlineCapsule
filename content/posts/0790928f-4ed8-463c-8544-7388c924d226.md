## Summary:
KPMG has merged its UK and Swiss firms to create a business with revenues of $4.4bn, aiming to tap into larger markets and boost profits. This merger is the biggest strategic change at KPMG since Jon Holt took over as UK chief executive in 2021. The new limited liability partnership will bring together UK and Swiss equity partners, with a single profit pool for both countries' partners.

## Interesting Questions:
Q: How might the merger of KPMG's UK and Swiss firms impact their competitiveness in the global market?
A: The merger is expected to increase KPMG's scale, allowing it to access larger markets such as financial services and life sciences. By combining resources and expertise from both countries, KPMG can offer a more comprehensive service to international clients across borders. This could potentially improve their competitiveness in the global market by providing better returns on joint investments in technology and reducing silos within the organization.

Q: What challenges might arise during the integration of KPMG's UK and Swiss firms, considering past attempts at merging European member firms?
A: Previous attempts to integrate European member firms have faced difficulties in delivering intended efficiencies. Challenges that may arise include aligning different corporate cultures, managing the complexities of a larger organization, and ensnaring regulatory differences between countries. KPMG will need to address these challenges effectively to ensure a successful merger and avoid repeating past mistakes.

Q: How might this strategic change affect Jon Holt's leadership at KPMG?
A: As the leader of the newly merged entity, Jon Holt has an opportunity to steer KPMG towards increased profitability by leveraging the combined resources and expertise from both UK and Swiss firms. His tenure extension until September 2eb99 indicates confidence in his ability to lead this strategic change. However, he will also face pressure to deliver on expectations of improved profits and better returns on joint investments, as well as managing the integration process effectively.
