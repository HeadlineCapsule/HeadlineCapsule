美国参议员敦促英国在Shein上市前调查其劳动做法

美国参议员马可·鲁比奥（Marco Rubio）呼吁英国政府在英国允许她因（Shein）在伦敦上市之前调查她的劳动做法。这家中国时尚集团被指控在新疆使用强迫劳动，在其试图在纽约上市时也引起了人们对不道德商业行为的担忧。

鲁比奥写信给英国财政大臣杰里米·亨特（Jeremy Hunt）和金融行为监管局（FCA）首席执行官尼希尔·拉蒂（Nikhil Rathi），敦促他们认真对待这些指控并彻底调查此事。围绕她因劳动做法的争议可能会阻止英国顶级机构投资者参与IPO。

她因否认了强迫劳动的说法，并坚持对这种做法的“零容忍”政策。然而，人权组织继续对少数民族被用作她因棉花供应链中的强迫劳动表示担忧。该公司拒绝就鲁比奥的信件发表评论，而英国财政部则由于英国选举前时期而没有做出回应。

美国指控中国在新疆对维吾尔族和其他少数民族犯下了“种族灭绝”罪，在那里有超过100万人被关押在拘留营中。鲁比奥还强调了她因涉嫌利用监管漏洞以避免从中国向美国运输产品时的海关检查和关税。

鲁比奥敦促英国和美国国会对这些做法采取行动，美国正在考虑立法以堵塞这样的漏洞。

 **Summary of Article:**
US Senator Marco Rubio has called upon the UK government to investigate Shein's labor practices before allowing its IPO in London. The Chinese fashion group is accused of using forced labor in Xinjiang, and concerns have been raised about unethical business practices during their attempt at a New York listing. 

Rubio wrote to UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Financial Conduct Authority CEO Nikhil Rathi, urging them to take these allegations seriously and investigate the matter thoroughly. The controversy surrounding Shein's labor practices could deter top UK institutional investors from participating in the IPO.

Shein has denied claims of forced labor and maintains a "zero tolerance" policy for such practices. However, human rights groups continue to raise concerns about ethnic minorities being used as forced labor within Shein's cotton supply chain. The company declined to comment on Rubio's letter, while the UK Treasury refrained from responding due to the pre-election period in Britain.

The US has accused China of committing "genocide" against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, where over 1 million individuals have been detained in camps. Rubio also highlighted Shein's alleged exploitation of regulatory loopholes to avoid customs inspections and duties when shipping products from China to the US.

Rubio has urged both the UK and Congress to take action against these practices, with legislation being considered in the US to close such loopholes.
