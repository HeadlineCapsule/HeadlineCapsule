# '今年 将开放一百个银行服务中心' 

在人们批评推行速度太慢后，**英国现金获取**（Cash Access UK）重申了其承诺，即在 2024 年在英国各地建立 100 个实体 **“银行服务中心”**。这些服务中心旨在填补退出的街头银行留下的空白，为社区提供基本的金融服务。

**英国现金获取**由 **九大贷款机构**资助，在苏格兰的杰德堡开设了其第 50 个服务中心。**银行服务中心**是共享空间，提供由 **贷款机构和邮局**运营的柜台服务，允许客户访问一系列金融服务，包括账单支付、银行咨询以及现金和支票存款。服务中心配备了 **"社区银行家"** 工作人员，他们与 **邮局负责人**合作，每天提供不同的银行服务。 

这一举措的推行速度受到密切关注，批评人士认为开放的服务中心数量太少。对此，**英国现金获取首席执行官加雷斯·奥克利**（Gareth Oakley）将所花费的时间归因于银行关闭公告和房产搜索等因素。此外，**全国建筑协会**（Nationwide）退出该计划也限制了设立服务中心的地点。尽管面临这些挑战，服务中心仍然受到欢迎，每天为数百名客户提供服务，并振兴了他们所服务的社区。 

街头银行的缓慢消失和向数字服务转变使许多依赖现金的人受到影响，凸显了替代取款点的关键需求。随着英国银行分行和 **建筑协会** 数量逐年大幅下降，这些服务中心被视为确保社区有足够的现金和银行服务访问权的一种潜在解决方案。 

监管机构和 **财政部经济秘书比姆·阿福拉米**（Bim Afolami）对这一进展表示欢迎，他强调了为所有社区保持现金和银行服务访问权的重要性。这与金融监管机构权力扩张的步调一致，包括 **英国金融行为监管局**（FCA）确保 95% 的人在取款时不会旅行超过三英里的任务。**工党**还承诺增强这些权力，以保证面对面的服务。

# 'One hundred banking hubs to be open this year' 

**Cash Access UK** has reaffirmed its commitment to establishing 100 physical "**banking hubs**" across the UK in 2024, following criticism regarding the slow pace of their rollout. These hubs aim to fill the gap left by retreating high-street banks, providing essential financial services to communities.

/n/n

**Cash Access UK**, funded by **nine major lenders**, has opened its 50th hub in Jedburgh, Scotland. **Banking hubs** are shared spaces offering counter services operated by **lenders and the Post Office**, allowing customers to access a range of financial services, including bill payments, banking advice, and cash and cheque deposits. The hubs are staffed by **"community bankers"** who work in partnership with **Post Office postmasters**, with a different bank available each day. 

/n/n

The rollout has faced scrutiny, with critics arguing that the openings have been too slow. In response, **Cash Access UK CEO Gareth Oakley** attributed the time taken to factors such as bank closure announcements and property searches. The exit of **Nationwide** from the scheme has also limited the locations where hubs can be established. Despite these challenges, the hubs have been well-received, serving hundreds of customers daily and revitalizing the communities they serve. 

/n/n

The slow disappearance of high-street banks and the shift towards digital services has left many individuals dependent on cash, highlighting the critical need for alternative access points. With the number of **UK bank branches** and **building societies** declining drastically over the years, these hubs are seen as a potential solution to ensure communities have sufficient access to cash and banking services. 

/n/n

The progress is welcomed by regulators and the **Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Bim Afolami**, who emphasized the importance of maintaining access to cash and banking services for all communities. This aligns with the recent expansion of financial regulators' powers, including the **FCA's** mandate to ensure that 95% of people do not travel more than three miles to withdraw cash. The **Labour Party** has also pledged to enhance these powers to guarantee face-to-face access.
