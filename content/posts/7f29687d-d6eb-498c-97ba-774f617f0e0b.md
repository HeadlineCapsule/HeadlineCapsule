# 安哥拉与中国国开行达成协议以缓解债务危机

非洲第二大石油生产国**安哥拉**与中国**国家开发银行**谈判达成协议，以减轻其债务负担。据财政部长维拉·戴维斯·德索萨（Vera Daves de Sousa）称，该国将提取存放在**特殊托管账户**中的现金抵押品，用于支付一笔数额巨大的贷款的利息。该协议揭示了中国银行为帮助负债国家而避免直接债务减免所采用的策略。根据协议，安哥拉可以提取每月 1.5 亿至 2 亿美元的资金来履行其财务义务。

这项协议的大背景十分重要，因为**安哥拉欠中国约 170 亿美元**，占其总债务的三分之一以上，主要形式为**以石油担保的贷款**。此前，由于该国经济衰退和冠状病毒疫情的影响，安哥拉曾暂停向中国债权人偿还债务三年。然而，2023 年恢复偿债，再加上其他财务承诺，使安哥拉的财政和货币面临压力。

目前的安排旨在避免全面的**债务重组**，安哥拉选择加快债务偿还以避免违约。这一进展凸显了国际债务管理的复杂动态，以及债务国和债权国为应对金融挑战而采用的策略。这也突显了替代融资来源的重要性，以及进入国际债券市场的潜在成本，新兴市场专家表示。

此外，安哥拉正在努力实现出口多样化，从石油转向农业和旅游业等部门。安哥拉退出欧佩克预计将为石油行业的私人部门投资提供更多灵活性，这可能推动生产增长。

# Angola agrees deal with Chinese state bank to ease debt crunch

**Angola**, Africa's second-largest oil producer, has negotiated an agreement with the **China Development Bank** to alleviate its debt burden. According to Finance Minister Vera Daves de Sousa, the nation will access cash held as collateral in a **special escrow account** to service interest payments on a substantial loan. This arrangement provides a glimpse into the strategies employed by Chinese banks to assist indebted countries without resorting to direct debt relief. The deal allows Angola to access funds, ranging from $150 million to $200 million monthly, to meet its financial obligations.

The context of this agreement is significant, as **Angola owes approximately $17 billion to China**, constituting over one-third of its total debt, primarily in the form of **oil-backed loans**. The nation's economic downturn and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic had previously led to a three-year moratorium on debt payments to Chinese creditors. However, the resumption of payments in 2023, alongside other financial commitments, strained Angola's finances and currency.

The current arrangement is designed to avoid a full-scale **debt restructuring**, with Angola opting to accelerate debt servicing to prevent default. This development highlights the intricate dynamics of international debt management and the strategies employed by both debtor and creditor nations to navigate financial challenges. It also underscores the importance of alternative financing sources and the potential costs associated with accessing international bond markets, as indicated by emerging market experts.

Additionally, Angola's efforts to diversify its exports away from oil and towards sectors like agriculture and tourism are ongoing. The nation's departure from OPEC is expected to provide more flexibility for private sector investment in the oil sector, potentially boosting production.
