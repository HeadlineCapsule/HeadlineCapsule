# Dutch coalition talks reach deadline as far right seeks power

**Dutch** parties are in the final stages of negotiating a **right-wing coalition government**, with **Geert Wilders'** **Freedom Party** set to gain **executive power** for the first time. Wilders' party won the November parliamentary elections with 23% of the vote, but he agreed not to become prime minister to secure a place in the government. The coalition includes the **conservative VVD**, the **centre-right NSC**, and the **populist Farmer-Citizen Movement**. Talks have focused on government finances, with Wilders making ambitious spending pledges, while the VVD and NSC prioritize a **low budget deficit**. A deal on finances was reached early this morning, and an agreement on the new government is expected soon. The cabinet is likely to consist of **party representatives** and **technocrats**, with Wilders suggesting a former **Dutch Labour member** as prime minister. However, analysts predict the coalition may be short-lived, potentially leading to fresh elections. 

In other news, the **EU** has pledged €100 million to support European **mining** and **recycling start-ups**, aiming to secure **critical raw materials** for the **green transition**. The funding will focus on greening mining processes and improving recycling capabilities, addressing skills gaps, and attracting private investment. This comes as the EU seeks to reduce its reliance on overseas suppliers for critical minerals.
