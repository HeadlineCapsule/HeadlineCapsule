塞尔维亚对军火流入乌克兰视而不见

**塞尔维亚向乌克兰出口弹药**

- 自从俄罗斯于2022年入侵乌克兰以来，塞尔维亚一直谨慎地通过第三方向西方盟友出口约8亿欧元的弹药。
- 尽管塞尔维亚没有加入西方对俄罗斯的制裁，但这些出口最终增强了乌克兰的防御能力。
- 亚历山大·武奇总统将此呈现为不偏不倚于战争的一项商业机会。
- 在冷战期间，塞尔维亚是南斯拉夫的一部分，其军工行业蓬勃发展，制造苏联标准弹药口径，至今仍被乌克兰武装部队广泛使用。
- 塞尔维亚的弹药价格比西方国家便宜，有进一步扩大出口的潜力。

 **Serbia's Ammunition Exports to Ukraine**

- Serbia has been discreetly exporting ammunition worth approximately €800mn to western allies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
- The exports are made via third parties and end up bolstering the defense of Ukraine, despite Serbia not joining Western sanctions against Russia.
- President Aleksandar Vučić presented this as a business opportunity without taking sides in the war.
- Serbia's arms industry thrived during the Cold War when it was part of Yugoslavia and manufactures Soviet-standard ammunition calibers still widely used by Ukraine's armed forces.
- The country is capitalizing on its cheaper ammunition prices compared to Western countries, with potential for further expansion in exports.
