这将是第一次在电视上进行选举。

## 摘要：
文章讨论了英国政治竞选活动的不断变化的格局，强调随着媒体消费习惯和技术进步的转变，电视直播活动随着时间的推移接触的人越来越少。英国广播公司（BBC）凭借《博士谁》等知识产权仍然是一个重要的参与者，但除了王室新闻、体育、基础设施问题、国民保健服务（NHS）和英国广播公司本身之外，共享国家叙事越来越多地碎片化。

## 有趣的问题：

1. 问：电视直播活动观众人数下降如何影响了政治竞选策略？
   答：传统媒体平台如电视的观众人数下降，迫使政治家调整他们的竞选策略，通过利用社交媒体和其他数字渠道来接触更广泛的受众。这种转变要求他们更加灵活和敏捷地应对在线话语快速变化的性质，同时要意识到内容可能会病毒式传播或在未来意外出现。

2. 问：英国广播公司在选举期间塑造公众舆论方面发挥什么作用？
   答：英国广播公司作为一家值得信赖和有影响力的媒体机构，通过提供新闻报道、举办辩论和制作《博士谁》等影响选民感知的意义内容，在塑造公众舆论方面发挥着重要作用。它的影响力不仅限于传统的电视观众，还包括拥有数百万人使用的新闻应用程序，使其成为政治家在选举期间与选民接触的重要平台。

3. 问：共享国家叙事的碎片化如何影响政治团结和公民归属感？
   答：共享国家叙事的碎片化可能会带来挑战，因为人们根据他们的媒体消费习惯可能有不同的优先事项或兴趣。这可能导致政治家在与不分享相同参考点和经历的选民之间找到共同点时遇到困难。此外，当关于国家故事或身份的共识减少时，获胜政党可能更难将公民团结在共同愿景之下。

## Summary:
The article discusses the changing landscape of political campaigns in the UK, highlighting how televised set-piece events reach fewer people over time due to shifts in media consumption habits and technology advancements. The BBC remains a significant player with its intellectual property like Doctor Who, but there is an increasing fragmentation of shared national storylines beyond royal family news, sports, infrastructure issues, the NHS, and the BBC itself.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How has the decline in viewership for televised set-piece events impacted political campaign strategies? 
   A: The decrease in viewership of traditional media platforms like television has forced politicians to adapt their campaign strategies, foceby leveraging social media and other digital channels to reach a wider audience. This shift requires them to be more agile and responsive to the fast-paced nature of online discourse while also being mindful that content can go viral or resurface unexpectedly in the future.
2. Q: What role does the BBC play in shaping public opinion during election campaigns? 
   A: The BBC, as a trusted and influential media organization, plays a significant role in shaping public opinion by providing news coverage, hosting debates, and producing popular content like Doctor Who that can influence voter perception. Its reach extends beyond traditional television viewership to its News app with millions of users, making it an essential platform for politicians to engage with the electorate during election campaigns.
3. Q: How does the fragmentation of shared national storylines impact political unity and a sense of belonging among citizens? 
   A: The fragmentation of shared national storylines can lead to challenges in fostering political unity, as people may have different priorities or interests based on their media consumption habits. This could result in politicians struggling to find common ground with voters who do not share the same points of reference and experiences. Additionally, it might be more difficult for a winning party to unite citizens under a shared vision when there is less consensus about what constitutes the national story or identity.
