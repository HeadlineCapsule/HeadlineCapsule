美国证券交易委员会（SEC）主席加里·根斯勒（Gary Gensler）谈论他的议程：“如果法院调整，我们也将调整”

**美国证券交易委员会主席加里·根斯勒（Gary Gensler）在法律挑战下的议程**

- 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）主席加里·根斯勒（Gary Gensler）决心推进他的规则制定议程，尽管面临法律挫折。
- 自2021年被任命以来，根斯勒一直致力于金融市场的雄心勃勃改革，包括美国国债和气候披露。然而，这些努力受到法官的阻碍，他们指责SEC过度监管。
- 面对法律挑战，根斯勒表示：“如果法院调整，我们也调整。”他仍然致力于推进他的议程并根据需要进行调整。
- 在根斯勒的领导下，SEC通过了多项新规则，但一些关键措施面临持续的法庭挑战。例如，美国上诉法院最近推翻了要求私募股权集团和对冲基金提供更多披露的规定。此外，该机构目前正在为其拟议的强制公司气候风险披露规则辩护，以应对多项诉讼。
- SEC还等待着两个可能影响联邦机构权力的最高法院意见：一个关于SEC内部法院的合宪性，另一个可能是推翻“切弗德原则”学说，该原则通常允许法院推迟对机构规则解释的裁决。
- 尽管行业批评者批评SEC过于迅速地通过了太多规则，但根斯勒为他的方法辩护，指出前任主席最终通过了更多的措施，并强调了他所追求的改革的重要性。
- 在Grayscale Investments提起诉讼后，SEC调整了加密货币监管立场；最初抵制后，它在2023年1月批准了比特币场外交易基金（ETF），现在正在考虑批准直接投资以太坊的ETF。
- 根斯勒对加密货币行业中缺乏利益冲突披露表示担忧，但愿意与希望注册其项目的公司合作。他还强调了加密货币领域中与欺诈和欺骗相关的持续问题。
- SEC主席渴望继续推动股票交易改革，尤其是减少跳价（买卖价格差）和经纪人支付的费用以获取报价交易所的价格。这些提议是最初于2022年12月提出的争议性一揽子计划的一部分。
- 根斯勒作为SEC主席的任期至2026年，但如果唐纳德·特朗普在11月的美国选举中击败乔·拜登，他可能会失去这一职位。

 **SEC Chair Gary Gensler's Agenda Amid Legal Challenges**

- US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, **Gary Gensler**, is determined to advance his rulemaking agenda despite facing legal setbacks. 
- Since his appointment in 2021, Gensler has pursued ambitious reforms across financial markets, including US Treasury bonds and climate disclosures. However, some of these efforts have been stymied by judges accusing the SEC of regulatory overreach.
- In response to legal challenges, Gensler stated: "If the courts adjust, we adjust." He remains committed to moving forward with his agenda and adapting as necessary.
- The SEC has adopted numerous new rules under Gensler's leadership but faces ongoing court challenges for some key measures. For example, a US appeals court recently overturned regulations requiring more disclosures from private equity groups and hedge funds. Additionally, the agency is currently defending its proposed rule mandating company climate risk disclosures against multiple lawsuits.
- The SEC is also awaiting two Supreme Court opinions that could impact federal agencies' power: one on the constitutionality of the SEC's in-house courts and another potentially overturning the "Chevron deference" doctrine, which generally allows courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of rules.
- Despite criticism from industry critics who argue that the SEC has adopted too many rules quickly, Gensler defended his approach by noting that previous chairs finalized more measures and emphasizing the consequential nature of his pursued reforms.
- The SEC has adjusted its stance on cryptocurrency regulation following a lawsuit from Grayscale Investments; after initially resisting, it approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2023 and is now considering approval for ETFs investing directly in ether.
- Gensler expressed concerns about the lack of disclosure regarding conflicts of interest within the cryptocurrency industry but remains open to working with those who wish to register their projects. He also highlighted ongoing issues related to scams and fraud within the crypto sector.
- The SEC chair is eager to continue pushing forward reforms in stock trading, particularly reducing tick sizes (the spread between buy and sell prices) and fees paid by brokers for accessing quoted exchange prices. These proposals are part of a contentious package initially proposed in December 2022.
- Gensler's term as SEC chair runs until 2026, but he may lose his position if Donald Trump wins the November US elections against Joe Biden.
