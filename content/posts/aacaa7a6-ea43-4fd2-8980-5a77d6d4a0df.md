# 雇主被敦促不要只关注额外福利，而是要从整体上支持员工 

近年来，**员工健康福祉**已经成为各公司关注的重点，而**健康应用程序和其他相关活动**也越来越受欢迎。它们被视为关怀员工健康的方式。然而，一种不断增长的共识是：雇主需要超越这些附加项目并解决影响员工幸福感的基础因素，例如工时和工作条件等。预防性医疗技术企业家**Reeva Misra**表示：“压力正在缩短我们的寿命”，公司有责任解决这个问题。这一观点得到了**德勤（Deloitte）**最近发布的一份报告的支持，该报告指出，“如果不解决员工福祉不佳的根本原因，就无法取得多大进展”。
因此，雇主们被敦促将重点转移到通过各种措施来创造更健康的工作环境上，例如确保适宜居住的时长和提供良好的工作条件。这包括调整职位设计、明确沟通、充足的休假时间以及有竞争力的薪酬和奖励等。公司若能在这些领域投入资金，就能同时提高员工福祉并收获提升后的抗压能力、参与度和生产力所带来的益处。
虽然目标明确的活动（例如医疗保健方案）仍然发挥着作用，特别是在美国这样的雇主拥有明确定定义的责任的领土上，但它们应该成为更全面的方法的一部分——该方法优先考虑的是整体解决方案而不是**零碎的措施** 。这涉及以协调的方式集合多种服务来有效地支持员工健康。最终，通过专注于创造健康的工作环境并在需要时提供有针对性的干预措施，雇主可以对员工福祉产生真正的影响。

# Employers urged to look beyond perks to support staff 

**Employee wellbeing** has become a key focus for companies in recent years, with **wellness apps and other initiatives** gaining traction as ways to support staff health. However, there is a growing consensus that employers need to go beyond these add-ons and address the underlying factors that impact employee wellbeing, such as working hours and conditions. According to **Reeva Misra**, an entrepreneur in preventive health tech, "stress is shortening our lifespan," and companies have a responsibility to address this issue. This view is supported by **Deloitte's** recent report, which states that "little progress can be made if the root causes of poor workforce wellbeing are not addressed."

As such, employers are being urged to shift their focus towards creating healthier work environments through measures such as ensuring liveable hours and providing good working conditions. This includes addressing job design, clear communication, adequate time off, and competitive pay and awards. By investing in these areas, companies can not only improve employee wellbeing but also reap the benefits of increased resilience, engagement, and productivity. 

While targeted initiatives like healthcare packages still have a role to play, especially in territories like the US where employers have explicit responsibilities, they should be part of a more comprehensive approach that prioritizes holistic solutions over **piecemeal gestures**. This involves bringing together various services in a coordinated manner to effectively support workers' health. Ultimately, by focusing on creating healthy work environments and providing targeted interventions when needed, employers can make a genuine impact on employee wellbeing.
