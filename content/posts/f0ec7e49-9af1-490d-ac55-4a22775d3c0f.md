# 英国地方政府获权拍卖一年以上空置店铺

---

为振兴**陷入困境的城镇中心**，**英国政府**授予**当地议会**权力，允许他们对**空置**一年以上的**店铺**进行**“商业街租赁拍卖”**。这项由**社区与地方政府事务大臣迈克尔·戈夫**设计的计划，旨在解决英国**商业街**上**长期空置店铺**的问题，重点关注那些被认为“坐拥空置房产**不作为**的**房东**。拍卖将**不设保留价**，房东有义务接受租户最高五年的**租期**，无论租金水平如何。

尽管英国政府认为这是为**衰败的城镇中心注入活力**的一种方式，但一些房东批评此举损害了其**财产权**。英国房地产联合会反驳了房东故意空置店铺的说法，认为**商业税**、**居民可支配收入低**和**购物习惯变化**才是罪魁祸首。尽管存在这些担忧，英国政府仍坚称该计划包含**保障措施**，以确保其合理性，该计划仅针对**不配合**的房东，并采取措施保护**邻近房产的价值**。随着试点计划将于今年夏天启动，英国政府希望赋能当地社区，转变那些陷入困境的商业街。

# UK councils win power to auction off shops vacant for more than a year

---

In an effort to **revitalize struggling town centers**, the **UK government** has granted **local councils** the power to hold **"high street rental auctions"** for **shops** that have been **vacant** for over a year. This scheme, designed by **Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove**, aims to address the issue of **long-term empty shops** on Britain's **high streets**, with a focus on **landlords** who are perceived to be "sitting on empty premises."** The auctions will have **no reserve price**, and landlords will be obliged to accept tenants for up to **five-year leases**, regardless of the offered rent. 

---

While the government sees this as a way to **breathe life into decaying town centers**, there is criticism from landlords who feel their **property rights** are being undermined. The British Property Federation refutes the notion that landlords deliberately keep shops empty, instead blaming **high business rates**, **low disposable incomes**, and **changing shopping habits**. Despite these concerns, the government maintains that the scheme includes **safeguards** to ensure proportionality, targeting only landlords who are **uncooperative** and taking steps to protect **neighboring property values**. With a pilot program set to begin this summer, the government hopes to empower local communities and transform struggling high streets.
