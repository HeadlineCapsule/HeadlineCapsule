# 坦诚差距成为政治家面临的问题

**公众期待政治家在沟通时更加透明、真实，摆脱传统的政治形象**。 英国首相里希·苏纳克在最近的地方选举后发表了令人困惑的言论，突显了 "坦诚差距"。这与人们在社交媒体个人账号上展现出的诚实态度形成鲜明对比。 政治和企业领袖之间的诚实度也存在显著差异，后者必须定期通过季度报告接受审核。**唐纳德·特朗普和鲍里斯·约翰逊，尽管存在差异，但他们代表了一种新型的拥抱真实性的政治家**。尽管他们并非真诚坦率，但他们特立独行的风格和即兴的演讲方式赢得了选民的共鸣。**肯尼迪总统的例子表明，政治成功往往依赖于精心打造的形象**。然而，**当今的选民渴望真实性和坦诚**，迫使政治家调整沟通策略，否则将面临失去信任的风险。

# The candour gap has become a problem for politicians

**The public expects politicians to be more transparent and authentic in their communication, stepping away from the traditional, polished image**. This "candour gap" is highlighted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's confusing statements following the recent local elections, which contrast with the honesty people exhibit in their personal lives on social media. The gap between political and corporate leaders' honesty is also notable, with the latter facing regular scrutiny through quarterly reports. **Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, despite their differences, represent a new breed of politicians who embrace authenticity**. Though not genuinely authentic, their eccentricities and off-the-cuff speaking styles resonate with voters. **As the example of JFK shows, political success often relies on a carefully crafted image**. Today, however, **voters crave authenticity and candour**, forcing politicians to adapt their communication strategies or risk losing trust.
