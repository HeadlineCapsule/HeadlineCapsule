# 布里奇沃特公司（Bridgewater）总裁称已“重新调整”了全球最大对冲基金

布里奇沃特联合公司（Bridgewater Associates）新任首席执行官（**CEO**）**尼尔·巴尔·迪亚**（Nir Bar Dea）对该公司进行了重大调整，以提高其投资表现，并与该公司创始人的传统划清界限。 迪亚（Dea）是一位前军官，于**2023 年 3 月**担任首席执行官，标志着一个漫长的继任计划结束和新篇章的开始。 他致力于解决该公司近年来面临的高员工流动率和投资回报率低的问题。 迪亚的策略包括关注反馈，让初级员工向高级员工提供意见，并减少旗舰**纯阿尔法**基金的规模以提高灵活性。 该基金在**2024 年**反弹，回报率约为 20%。 Bridgewater 还正在试验一个利用**人工智能**和**大型语言模型**的新宏观基金，这些模型来自像** OpenAI**和** Anthropic** 这样的公司。 巴尔·迪亚的目标是恢复布里奇沃特（Bridgewater）作为不仅是世界上最大的而且是表现最好的对冲基金的声誉。

巴尔·迪亚强调，有必要对该公司进行“重新布线”，这标志着与达尔文时代决裂。 他承认员工流动率高和投资回报低的挑战。 新任首席执行官旨在培养一种“绝对真理”的文化，并实施了一套反馈系统，让初级员工向高级员工提供意见。 为提高市场波动时的灵活性，巴尔·迪亚计划将纯阿尔法基金的资产从 800 亿美元缩减至 500 亿至 600 亿美元。 这一策略已经取得了积极成效，该基金在 2024 年反弹，回报率达到约 20%。 此外，布里奇沃特公司正在试验一个利用人工智能和大型语言模型的新宏观基金。 巴尔·迪亚相信，这些变化将恢复布里奇沃特在对冲基金行业的领先地位。

# Bridgewater’s chief says he has ‘rewired’ world’s largest hedge fund 

**Nir Bar Dea**, the new CEO of Bridgewater Associates, has implemented significant changes at the firm in an effort to improve its investment performance and distance itself from the legacy of its founder, **Ray Dalio**. Dea, a former military officer, became CEO in **March 2023**, marking the end of a lengthy succession plan and a new chapter for the company. He aims to address issues such as high staff turnover and underwhelming investment returns, which have plagued the firm in recent years. Dea's strategy includes a focus on feedback, with junior employees providing input to senior staff, and a reduction in the size of the flagship **Pure Alpha** fund to increase agility. The fund has seen a rebound in **2024**, with returns of about 20%. Bridgewater is also experimenting with a new macro fund that utilizes **artificial intelligence** and **large language models** from companies like **OpenAI** and **Anthropic**. Bar Dea's goal is to restore Bridgewater's reputation as not only the largest but also the best-performing hedge fund in the world.

Bar Dea emphasized the need for "rewiring" the firm, marking a break from Dalio's era. He acknowledged the challenges of high staff turnover and underwhelming investment returns. The new CEO aims to foster a culture of "absolute truth" and has implemented a feedback system where junior employees provide input to senior staff. To improve agility during market swings, Bar Dea plans to shrink the Pure Alpha fund's assets from $80 billion to between $50 billion and $60 billion. This strategy is already showing positive results, with the fund rebounding in 2024 and achieving returns of about 20%. Additionally, Bridgewater is experimenting with a new macro fund that leverages artificial intelligence and large language models. Bar Dea is confident that these changes will restore Bridgewater's dominance in the hedge fund industry.
