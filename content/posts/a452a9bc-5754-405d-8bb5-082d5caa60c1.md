# 日本银行应如何处理其庞大的股票投资组合?

**日本银行**（**BOJ**）在 14 年内积累了大量**交易所交易基金**（**ETF**）投资组合，约占**日本上市公司股票**的 **7%**。随着近期决定停止这一**货币宽松计划**，日本银行面临着管理其价值约**五千亿美元**的巨额股票持股的挑战。退出策略不当可能会对**日本股市**造成负面影响，并**损害央行的通胀目标**。

虽然日本银行的 ETF 投资获得了**盈利回报**，并推动了**安倍经济学时期股市上涨**，但该行并非典型的股票持有人，面临着独特的会计挑战。必须计入未实现的股票亏损，而未实现的收益则不计算在内，这会造成对股价波动的**单边脆弱性**。

人们提出了几种退出策略：一种是逐渐缓慢地出售 ETF，类似于全球金融危机后采取的办法；另一种是向类似**政府养老金投资基金**（**GPIF**）的实体进行场外交易；还有一种是效仿**香港金融管理局**（HKMA）的例子，即购买股票以捍卫金融体系、盈利和扩大股票所有权。

香港金管局的做法是购买股票以捍卫货币挂钩，后来将其转移至大型 ETF，并向零售和机构投资者提供折扣，这与日本政府**降低日本银行的风险**、扩大家庭股票所有权以及可能实现盈利的目标一致。

然而，将持股转移至**主权财富基金**作为中间步骤也可能会有所帮助，因为这能够提供风险对冲，并与政府在政策领域的销售或捐赠之长期计划进行协调。日本央行行长**黑田东彦**表示倾向于采取谨慎的办法，而该计划的盈利为制定一项协调周密的战略争取了一些时间。

# What should the Bank of Japan do with its huge stock portfolio?

The **Bank of Japan** (**BOJ**) has accumulated a substantial portfolio of **exchange-traded funds** (**ETFs**) over 14 years, equivalent to approximately **7% of listed Japanese companies' stocks**. With the recent decision to halt this aspect of its **monetary easing program**, the BOJ is faced with the challenge of managing its massive stock holdings, valued at around **half a trillion dollars**. A mismanaged exit strategy could negatively impact the **Japanese equity market** and **undermine the bank's inflation objectives**. 

While the BOJ's ETF investments have generated **profitable returns** and contributed to **Abenomics-era stock market gains**, the bank is not a typical stockholder and faces unique accounting challenges. Unrealized stock losses must be accounted for, while unrealized gains are not recognized, creating an **asymmetric vulnerability to stock price volatility**. 

Several exit strategies have been proposed: a gradual, slow-paced sale of ETFs similar to the approach taken post-**global financial crisis**; an off-market transaction to a entity like the **Government Pension Investment Fund** (**GPIF**); or following the **Hong Kong Monetary Authority's** example of defending the financial system, making a profit, and broadening stock ownership. 

The HKMA approach, which involved purchasing stocks to defend the currency peg and later transferring them to a large ETF with a discount for retail and institutional investors, aligns with the Japanese government's objectives of **derisking the BOJ's balance sheet**, broadening stock ownership among households, and potentially generating profits. 

However, transferring holdings to a **sovereign wealth fund** as an intermediate step could also be beneficial, allowing for risk warehousing and coordination with the government on a broader plan for sales or endowments in policy areas. The BOJ governor, **Kazuo Ueda**, has indicated a preference for a cautious approach, and the program's profits provide some time to develop a well-coordinated strategy.
