# **法国和英国银行**从非洲撤资，法国兴业银行位列其中

**法国和英国银行**正在退出非洲市场，这标志着它们对该市场热情的转变，之前它们认为非洲是**增长市场**，并能提升其**可持续发展资历**。这一举动可能会引发人们对非洲可持续发展的担忧，但同时也为**泛非银行集团**提供了契机，推动非洲的**金融包容性**和国内投资。

法国兴业银行曾宣传其非洲业务表现出其对可持续增长的承诺，但现在正逐步剥离其在多个非洲国家的子公司。这部分是由于该银行聚焦核心市场和盈利能力的结果，但也反映出法国和英国银行退出非洲市场的整体趋势。巴克莱银行、渣打银行、法国农业信贷银行和法国巴黎银行等都在减少其在非洲的业务足迹。

这些银行退出非洲市场的原因有很多，包括非洲业务与银行其他业务之间缺乏协同效应、风险较高且回报较低，以及法国银行退出背后存在的**地缘政治因素**，因为马克龙政府正在重新评估其在非洲大陆的战略存在。

然而，国际银行的离开也为当地银行提供了机会。西非银行，如布基纳法索的Coris集团和几内亚的Vista集团，迅速收购了退出非洲的欧洲银行的子公司。这些当地银行强调其对小企业的重视，以及其在减少贫困和支持可持续增长方面的作用。

泛非银行集团的崛起有助于促进金融包容性，因为它们受到的监管资本要求较宽松，资本成本较低。与欧洲同行相比，它们也更愿意向小型公司和零售业的低端部分放贷。

虽然所有权的转移并不能保证改善普通非洲人的治理状况，但它为非洲本土银行提供了契机，推动该大陆的金融包容性和可持续发展。然而，也存在一些风险，包括可能中断促进跨境支付的**银行间结算关系**。

随着国际银行退出非洲市场，泛非银行有机会填补空缺，推动非洲大陆亟需的金融包容性和可持续增长。

# Société Générale among French and UK banks pulling back from Africa 

**French and UK banks** are retreating from the African market, marking a shift from their previous enthusiasm for the continent as a **growth market** and a means to bolster their **sustainability credentials**. This move may seem concerning for Africa's sustainable development, but it opens opportunities for **pan-African banking groups** to step in and drive **financial inclusion** and domestic investment. 

Société Générale, which once promoted its presence in Africa as a commitment to sustainable growth, is now disposing of its subsidiaries in multiple countries. This is partly due to the bank's focus on core markets and profitability, but also reflects a broader trend among French and UK banks exiting the African market. Barclays, Standard Chartered, Crédit Agricole, and BNP Paribas are among those reducing their African footprint. 

The exits are driven by various factors, including a lack of perceived synergies between African operations and the rest of their businesses, as well as higher risks and lower returns. There is also a **geopolitical dimension** to the French banks' exit, as the Macron government reevaluates its strategic presence on the continent. 

However, the departure of international banks creates opportunities for local banks to step in. West African banks, such as Burkina Faso's Coris Group and Guinea's Vista Group, have been quick to acquire subsidiaries from departing European banks. These local banks emphasize their focus on small businesses and their role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable growth. 

The growth of pan-African bank groups could boost financial inclusion, as they are subject to less stringent regulatory capital requirements and have lower costs of capital. They are also better positioned to lend to smaller companies and the lower end of the retail segment, which may have been overlooked by their European counterparts. 

While the shift in ownership does not guarantee improved governance for ordinary Africans, it presents an opportunity for African-owned banks to drive financial inclusion and support sustainable development on the continent. However, there are risks, including potential disruptions to **correspondent banking relationships** that facilitate cross-border payments. 

As international banks exit the African market, there is a chance for pan-African banks to fill the void and drive much-needed financial inclusion and sustainable growth on the continent.
