# **英国酒吧** 正在从多年的关闭中恢复过来

具有悠久历史的 **英国酒吧** 正在展现出复苏的迹象，它们的历史可追溯至 **罗马和盎格鲁-撒克逊时期**。在经历了疫情封锁和通胀压力带来的重创后（去年有超过 500 家酒吧倒闭），近期报告显示了一种积极的转变，一些酒吧重新开业，并得到了投资以进行改造和提升，这些酒吧深受人们喜爱。

**喜力啤酒**（Heineken）这家知名的啤酒制造商，正带领大家重返此前关闭的酒吧并投入资金进行装修。著名的酒吧连锁店 **JD Wetherspoon** 也报告了其销售的“稳步复苏”，并半开玩笑地提到其退休顾客情绪的改善。尽管该行业仍保持谨慎，但随着酒吧展现出适应能力，不断进化以满足顾客不断变化的需求和口味，人们还是感到了一丝宽慰和乐观。

**炮兵臂枪**（Artillery Arms）酒吧有着独一无二的历史，曾经是 **杀鼠锦标赛** 的举办地，如今它迎合了不同人群的需求，开始接受即将到来的 2024 年欧洲足球锦标赛的预订。该酒吧位于伦敦市，这里以酒吧高度集中而著称，这无疑增加了它的吸引力。

几十年来，酒吧的重新分布十分显著，农村地区和外郊区酒吧关闭，而哈克尼等城市地区的酒吧数量却在增加。这种转变归因于 **绅士化**（gentrification），酒吧也随之进行调整，引入了不同活动区域并扩大了餐饮服务范围。传统的“以酒为主”的酒吧主要关注饮酒，而今天的酒吧则演变成多功能空间，以满足更广泛的顾客偏好。

不可否认，该行业面临着诸多挑战，像 **Stonegate** 这样的酒吧集团正在应对财务困境。然而，酒吧也展现出了韧性和创新精神，不断寻找新的繁荣之路。尽管困难重重，**英国酒吧** 仍是该国备受喜爱的标志性文化元素，正如希莱尔·贝洛克的著名警句：“当你失去了客栈，就让你空虚的灵魂沉入水底吧，因为你已经失去了最后的英格兰。”

# British pubs are recovering from years of closing time

**British pubs**, long-standing institutions with a rich history dating back to **Roman and Anglo-Saxon times**, are showing signs of recovery after a challenging period. The pandemic lockdowns and inflationary pressures have taken their toll, with over 500 pubs shutting down last year. However, recent reports indicate a positive shift, with some pubs reopening and investments being made to adapt and improve these beloved establishments.

Heineken, a prominent brewer, is leading the way by reinvesting in previously closed pubs and allocating funds for refurbishments. JD Wetherspoon, a well-known pub chain, has also reported a "steady recovery" in sales, with a lighthearted nod to the improved mood of their retired customers. While the industry is cautious, there is a sense of relief and optimism as pubs demonstrate their adaptability, evolving to meet the changing needs and tastes of their patrons. 

/**/

The **Artillery Arms**, a pub with a unique history, exemplifies this evolution. Once a venue for **rat-killing tournaments**, it now caters to a different crowd, taking bookings for the upcoming Euro 2024 football tournament. The pub's location in the City of London, an area known for its high concentration of pubs, also contributes to its appeal. 

/**/

The redistribution of pubs in recent decades has been notable, with closures in rural areas and outer suburbs, but an increase in urban areas like Hackney. This shift is attributed to **gentrification**, and pubs are adapting to these changes by introducing "zones" for different activities and expanding their food offerings. While traditional "wet-led" pubs focused primarily on drinking, today's pubs are transforming into versatile spaces that cater to a wider range of customer preferences. 

/**/

The challenges faced by the industry cannot be overlooked, and pub groups like Stonegate are navigating financial hurdles. However, there is a sense of resilience and innovation as pubs find new ways to thrive. Despite the difficulties, the British pub remains a beloved and iconic part of the country's cultural fabric, as evidenced by Hilaire Belloc's famous warning: "When you have lost your inns, drown your empty selves, for you will have lost the last of England."
