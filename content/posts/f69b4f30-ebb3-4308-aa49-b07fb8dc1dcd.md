# 美国页岩油公司被控合谋操纵油价 

**美国页岩油行业** 面临一波**集体诉讼**，指控包括埃克森美孚、西方石油公司和戴蒙德巴克能源公司在内的主要企业**合谋限制产量和推高油价**。在此之前，**美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）** 也对先锋自然资源公司前总裁斯科特·谢菲尔德（Scott Sheffield）提出了类似的指控。这些诉讼针对该行业的**资本纪律**模式，认为生产商优先考虑向投资者返利，而不是响应高油价提高产量。原告认为，在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，原油价格上涨，但生产商集体未能提高产量，这损害了消费者的利益，也违背了这些公司的自身利益。 

FTC 对谢菲尔德的调查结果显示，他试图与**欧佩克**和其他美国生产商协调产量，这一事件将合谋操纵问题推到了聚光灯下。现已并入埃克森美孚的先锋公司否认有任何不当行为，声称 FTC 对石油市场的运作有误解。随着更多诉讼的预期，代表原告的律师正集中审查潜在合谋的证据，包括谢菲尔德的 **WhatsApp 消息**和其他通讯记录。这些诉讼指控被告违反了**《谢尔曼反垄断法》**及州反垄断法和消费者保护法，要求为支付高油价的消费者提供赔偿。然而，法律专家警告称，要证明合谋操纵并非易事，FTC 对谢菲尔德的指控也尚未在法庭上得到全面检验。

# US Shale Companies Accused of Collusion Over Oil Price

**The US shale oil industry** is facing a wave of **class-action lawsuits** alleging that major players, including ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, and Diamondback Energy, **colluded to curb output and raise prices**. This comes on the heels of similar claims made by the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** against Scott Sheffield, the former head of Pioneer Natural Resources. The lawsuits take issue with the industry's model of **capital discipline**, where producers have prioritized returning cash to investors over increasing production in response to high prices. Plaintiffs argue that this collective failure to boost output as crude prices rose following Russia's invasion of Ukraine hurt consumers and went against the self-interest of the companies. 

The FTC's findings against Sheffield, alleging he attempted to coordinate production levels with **OPEC** and other US producers, have brought the issue into the spotlight. Pioneer, now owned by Exxon, denies any wrongdoing, claiming the FTC has misunderstood the dynamics of the oil market. With more lawsuits expected, lawyers representing plaintiffs are homing in on evidence of potential collusion, including **WhatsApp messages** and other communications by Sheffield. The lawsuits allege violations of the **Sherman Act** and state antitrust and consumer protection laws, with damages sought for consumers who paid higher petrol prices. However, legal experts caution that proving collusion is challenging and that the FTC's allegations against Sheffield have yet to be fully tested in court.
