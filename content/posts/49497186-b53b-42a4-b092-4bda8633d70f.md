提前还款导致中国抵押贷款支持证券市场缩水65%

# 摘要：
文章讨论了中国住宅抵押贷款支持证券市场的显著下降，在过去的一年里，由于房产所有者的提前还款，该市场缩减了65%。预付率达到43%的年度化水平，比通常情况高出四倍。这种趋势归因于家庭选择在投资选择有限和经济不确定性的情况下偿还债务，以及政府政策变化导致的较低借贷成本。

自2021年以来，中国抵押贷款市场受到开发商资金危机的影响，影响了施工和更广泛的经济。当大型国有银行降低抵押贷款利率时，预付率最初飙升到63%的年度化水平。分析师认为，客户选择偿还债务而不是投资低收益财富管理产品，导致预付率在政策变化实施之前稳步上升。

抵押贷款支持证券的投资者面临“预付风险”，因为基础抵押贷款提前偿还，他们需要以类似利率寻找新的投资机会。抵押贷款支持证券的新发行量下降，是因为购买房屋的人数减少、中国经济中的投资机会有限、股票表现不佳以及对离岸投资的限制。

高预付率还可以归因于现有房产销售的增加，而不是由于开发商财务问题而对新房购买的担忧。

 **Summary:**  
The article discusses a significant decrease in China's residential mortgage-backed securities market, which has shrunk by 65% over the past year due to early repayments from property owners. The pre-payment rate reached an annualized level of 43%, four times higher than usual rates. This trend is attributed to households opting to pay down debts amidst limited investment options and economic uncertainty, as well as lower borrowing costs resulting from government policy changes.

The mortgage market in China has been impacted by a funding crisis among developers since #2021, which affected construction and the wider economy. The pre-payment rate initially spiked to 63% on an annualized basis when major state-owned banks reduced mortgage interest rates. Analysts believe that customers are choosing to pay down their debts instead of investing in low-yield wealth management products, leading to a steady increase in the pre-payment rate even before policy changes were implemented.

Investors in mortgage-backed securities face "pre-payment risk" when underlying mortgages are repaid early and they need to find new investment opportunities at similar rates. The decline in new issuance of mortgage-backed securities is linked to fewer people buying houses, limited investment opportunities within China's economy, stock performance issues, and restrictions on offshore investments.

The high pre-payment rate can also be attributed to the rise in sales of existing properties compared to concerns over purchases of new builds due to developer finance problems.
