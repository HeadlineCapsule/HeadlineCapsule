# **局外人萨利姆·拉姆吉** (Salim Ramji) 承诺为先锋集团带来皈依者的热情

**萨利姆·拉姆吉**（Salim Ramji）作为先锋集团（Vanguard）新任首席执行官，为这家**9.3 万亿美元**的资产管理公司带来了丰富的经验和皈依者的热情。作为首位领导先锋集团的局外人，拉姆吉计划将其触角扩展至目前的 5000 万客户之外，特别是在**咨询服务**领域。凭借其在**财富管理**方面的背景和对行业的深刻洞察，他有望推动增长，尤其是在**国际市场**上，先锋集团落后于其竞争对手贝莱德（BlackRock）。拉姆吉沟通和建立共识的能力将至关重要，因为他面临的挑战是要在推动创新和扩张的同时，维护公司的独特**互助结构**和文化认同。他专注于技术和扩大先锋集团服务范围的做法可能会带来改变，而他在贝莱德担任**ETF**相关职务时积累的经验，对于该公司抓住行业趋势并巩固市场地位也将是无价之宝。拉姆吉的任命标志着先锋集团的新方向，而他平衡传统与创新的能力将是该公司未来成功的重要因素。

拉姆吉最初从事律师，后来成为顾问，他一路晋升，成为麦肯锡（McKinsey）的高级合伙人，负责资产和财富管理业务。他在贝莱德担任 iShares ETF 和指数业务主管的最近一份工作，展示了他推出创新产品的能力以及他对最新行业趋势的了解。随着先锋集团的资产主要集中在美国，拉姆吉的国际经验和视野可以帮助该公司扩大全球影响力。然而，他将需要谨慎地把握这家公司的独特文化，这种文化深深植根于其创始人杰克·博格爾（Jack Bogle）的原则中。作为先锋集团的第五任首席执行官，拉姆吉肩负着在维护核心价值观和宗旨的同时，推动公司发展的艰巨任务。

# Outsider Salim Ramji Promises to Bring Convert’s Zeal to Vanguard 

**Salim Ramji**, the newly appointed CEO of Vanguard, brings a wealth of experience and a convert's enthusiasm to the $9.3tn asset manager. Ramji, the first outsider to lead Vanguard, plans to expand its reach beyond its current 50 million customers, particularly in the realm of **advisory offerings**. With a background in **wealth management** and a strong vision for the industry, he is well-positioned to drive growth, especially in the **international market**, where Vanguard has lagged behind its competitor, BlackRock. Ramji's ability to communicate and build consensus will be key as he navigates the challenge of maintaining the company's unique **mutual structure** and cultural identity while driving innovation and expansion. His focus on technology and scaling up Vanguard's offerings could be a game-changer, and his experience with **ETFs** at BlackRock will be invaluable as the company seeks to capitalize on industry trends and consolidate its position in the market. Ramji's appointment signals a new direction for Vanguard, and his ability to balance tradition with innovation will be crucial to the company's future success. 

/n/n

Starting his career as a lawyer and then as a consultant, Ramji rose through the ranks to become a senior partner at McKinsey, in charge of its asset and wealth management practice. His most recent role at BlackRock, heading the iShares ETF and index business, showcased his ability to launch innovative products and his understanding of the latest industry trends. With Vanguard's assets predominantly US-based, Ramji's international experience and perspective could help the company expand its global reach. However, he will need to carefully navigate the company's unique culture and structure, which is deeply rooted in its founder, Jack Bogle's, principles. As Vanguard's fifth CEO, Ramji has the challenging task of evolving the company while preserving its core values and purpose.
