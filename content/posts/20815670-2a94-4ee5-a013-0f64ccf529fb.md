降级法国信用评级，马克龙政府很受伤

**摘要：**
本文讨论了标准普尔全球评级（S&P Global）将法国信用评级从 AA 下调至 AA- 的情况，理由是政府债务比率不断增加和低于预期的增长。这一降级被视为对马克龙总统信誉的一击，在中间派联盟预计将在即将举行的欧洲选举中失败的情况下，可能会产生政治后果。尽管遇到这个挫折，法国仍然保持着高质量债务发行国的声誉，并继续吸引投资者。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：马克龙政府如何解决标准普尔全球评级对法国不断增加的债务比率所表达的担忧？
   答案：为了解决这些担忧，马克龙政府可以在现有的结构性改革之外实施额外的减少预算赤字的措施。这可能涉及削减公共服务支出和异常的疫情/能源危机措施，或者在不提高家庭或公司税收的情况下寻找替代收入来源。

2. 问题：这次信用评级下降对马克龙政府有什么潜在的政治影响？
   答案：信用评级下降可能会导致严重的政治后果，因为它破坏了马克龙的信誉和经济管理能力。反对党可能会利用这个机会通过不信任动议或议会辩论来挑战他处理公共财政的方式。然而，鉴于马克龙的中间派联盟已经在欧洲选举中面临广泛的失败，这些政治挑战将对政府稳定和立法通过能力产生多大影响尚不确定。

3. 问题：法国信用评级下降如何影响其借贷成本和投资者信心？
   答案：尽管降级了，但专家认为法国的借贷成本可能不会受到显著影响，因为该国享有作为高质量债务发行国的可靠声誉。投资者仍然对法国的债券表现出兴趣，德国和法国之间10年期债券的利差甚至在今年略有收窄。然而，如果不断增加的政府债务比率的担忧持续或恶化，最终可能会导致法国的借贷成本上升。

台湾总统马克龙在标准普尔全球评级将该国信用评级从 AA 下调至 AA- 后面临批评，理由是政府债务比率不断增加和低于预期的增长。这一降级被视为对马克龙总统信誉的一击，在中间派联盟预计将在即将举行的欧洲选举中失败的情况下，可能会产生政治后果。尽管遇到这个挫折，台湾仍然保持着高质量债务发行国的声誉，并继续吸引投资者。

**Summary:**  
The article discusses France's recent credit rating downgrade by S&P Global from AA to AA-, citing concerns about increasing government debt ratios and lower-than-expected growth. The downgrade is seen as a blow to President Macron’s credibility, with potential political fallout amidst his centrist alliance's expected defeat in the upcoming European elections. Despite this setback, France maintains its reputation as an issuer of high-quality debt and continues to attract investors.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. Q: How might Macron’s government address the concerns raised by S&P Global regarding France's increasing debt ratios?  
A: To address these concerns, Macron's government could implement additional budget-deficit-reducing measures beyond structural reforms already in place. This may involve cutting spending on public services and exceptional pandemic/energy crisis measures or finding alternative sources of revenue without raising taxes on households or companies.
2. Q: What are the potential political implications for Macron's government following this credit rating downgrade?  
A: The credit rating downgrade could lead to significant political fallout, as it undermines Macron’s credibility and stewardship of the economy. Opposition parties may use this opportunity to challenge his handling of public finances through no-confidence motions or debates in parliament. However, given that Macron's centrist alliance is already facing a broad defeat in European elections, it remains uncertain how much impact these political challenges will have on the government’s stability and ability to pass legislation.
3. Q: How might France's credit rating downgrade affect its borrowing costs and investor confidence?  
A: Despite the downgrade, experts believe that French borrowing costs may not be significantly impacted due to the country's reputation as a reliable issuer of high-quality debt. Investors continue to show interest in France’s bonds, with the spread between German and French 10-year bonds even slightly narrowing this year. However, if concerns about increasing government debt ratios persist or worsen, it could eventually lead to higher borrowing costs for France.
