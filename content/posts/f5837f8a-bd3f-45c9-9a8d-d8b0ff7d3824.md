# 在约翰·斯温尼（John Swinney）接过重担之际，苏格兰民族党留下了怎样的遗产？

**苏格兰新任首席部长** 约翰·斯温尼（John Swinney）在上任后面临着巨大的挑战，需要重建人们对**苏格兰民族党**(**SNP**)管理**公共服务**能力的信任，特别是在疫情之后。作为一位资深政治家，斯温尼打算展示苏格兰民族党的成就，并实施**温和的中左翼政策议程**以推动**经济增长**并支持公共服务。然而，苏格兰在苏格兰民族党治理下的经济表现一直存在争议。尽管苏格兰民族党推行了进步的政策，但商业领袖认为他们的做法阻碍了经济增长，**苏格兰的人均国内生产总值**一直落后于英国其他地区。苏格兰民族党将这一问题归咎于紧缩政策和英国退出欧盟等因素，认为这是西敏寺自残造成的。

苏格兰一度以教育为傲，但近年来，学生的成绩却有所下降，批评者指责苏格兰民族党的政策损害了基本技能的学习。医疗保健也面临挑战，虽然苏格兰民族党成功避免了国民保健服务（NHS）的罢工，但长期的**等待时间**和未达成的目标也困扰着医疗体系。在苏格兰民族党执政期间，犯罪率有所下降，但暴力犯罪仍然是一个问题，警察人数也有所减少。苏格兰民族党在解决**儿童贫困**问题上的努力是值得注意的，但专家质疑一些政策的有效性，相对儿童贫困率仍然很高。随着斯温尼接过领导棒，他需要解决这些问题，恢复人们对苏格兰民族党有效治理能力的信任，特别是在教育和医疗保健等关键领域。随着苏格兰努力缩小与英国其他地区国内生产总值差距，苏格兰民族党的经济政策及其对增长的影响也将受到密切关注。

# What is the SNP legacy left as John Swinney takes on the mantle in Scotland?

John Swinney, **Scotland's new first minister**, has big shoes to fill as he takes office, facing challenges in rebuilding trust in the **Scottish National Party's** (**SNP**) handling of **public services**, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Swinney, a veteran politician, intends to showcase the SNP's achievements and implement a **moderate, centre-left policy agenda** to boost **economic growth** and support public services. However, Scotland's economic performance under the SNP has been a point of contention. While the SNP boasts of progressive policies, business leaders argue that their approach has hindered economic growth, with **Scotland's per capita GDP** consistently trailing that of the rest of the UK. The SNP blames this on factors like **austerity** and **Brexit**, which they see as self-inflicted wounds by Westminster.

**Education**, once a source of pride for Scotland, has seen a decline in attainment levels, with critics blaming the SNP's policies for undermining basic skills. Healthcare, too, presents a challenge, with long **waiting times** and missed targets, although the SNP points out their success in avoiding NHS strikes. Crime rates have decreased during the SNP's tenure, but violent crime remains an issue, and police numbers have fallen. The SNP's efforts to tackle **child poverty** are noteworthy, but experts question the effectiveness of some policies, and relative child poverty rates remain high. As Swinney takes the reins, he will need to address these issues and restore faith in the SNP's ability to govern effectively, especially in critical areas like education and healthcare. The party's economic policies and their impact on growth will also be under scrutiny as Scotland strives to close the GDP gap with the rest of the UK.
