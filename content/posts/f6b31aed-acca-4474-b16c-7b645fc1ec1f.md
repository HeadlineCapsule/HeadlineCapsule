# 美国军方向海地空运物资，为外国安保力量做准备

**美国空军** 正在向海地的太子港空运**民用承包商**和**设备**，为部署**联合国授权的多国安保力量**做准备。这支力量由**1000 名肯尼亚警察**领导，并得到来自其他国家警察的支持，旨在恢复海地的秩序。该国目前正遭受暴力帮派的控制，局势动荡。美国国务院承诺为此次任务提供约 **3 亿美元资金**支持，但表示不会派遣美国军队。据分析人士称，此次行动将加强海地警察的力量，海地警察一直在与帮派斗争，9000人的警察队伍中只有约 **3000名警察**在执行任务。

海地局势不断恶化，帮派势力不断扩大对街道的控制，导致**抢劫、强奸和广泛的恐怖活动**。该国**主要的医院**由于位于冲突地区而关闭，**医疗体系陷入危机**，同时**粮食危机**也不断加剧，140 万人面临饥荒风险。政治形势也动荡不安，临时总理阿里埃尔·亨利 (Ariel Henry) 最近辞职，并成立了一个过渡总统委员会。该委员会在美国和加勒比国家的支持下，旨在举行海地 2016 年以来的首次选举，但内部争端不断。

海地的**帮派暴力活动**已经蔓延至全国，对当地社区的控制力不断增强，这促使联合国安理会授权组建一支外国安全部队，帮助海地恢复稳定。美国积极响应，通过空运方式提供援助，为外国安全部队的部署做准备。这表明美国致力于帮助海地解决帮派暴力问题，改善该国不断恶化的局势。

# US Military Flies Supplies to Haiti in Preparation for Foreign Security Force 

The **US Air Force** is delivering **civilian contractors** and **equipment** to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in preparation for the deployment of a **UN-authorized multinational security force**. This force, led by **1,000 Kenyan police officers** and supported by additional officers from various nations, aims to restore order in Haiti, which is currently gripped by violent gang activity. The US State Department has pledged around **$300 million in funding** for the mission but has ruled out sending American troops. The operation is expected to bolster Haiti's police force, which has been struggling to contain the gangs and has only about **3,000 operational officers** out of a total force of 9,000, according to analysts.

The situation in Haiti has deteriorated, with gangs expanding their control over neighborhoods, resulting in **looting, rapes, and widespread terror**. The airport, essential for any international support, had been closed since late February due to gang attacks but has recently been secured by Haitian police, enabling the arrival of the US aircraft. The country is also facing a **healthcare crisis**, with the main hospital closed due to its location in a conflict zone, and a **food crisis**, with 1.4 million people at risk of famine. The political situation has also been tumultuous, with the recent resignation of interim prime minister Ariel Henry and the formation of a transitional presidential council. The council, backed by the US and Caribbean countries, aims to hold Haiti's first elections since 2016 but has already faced internal disputes.
