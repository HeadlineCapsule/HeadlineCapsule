# Artificial intelligence companies seek big profits from ‘small’ language models

Large **technology companies** are shifting their focus to **'small' language models** as a new avenue for profit. These models, with fewer parameters, are more affordable and accessible to businesses, addressing concerns about the high costs and computational demands of **large language models (LLMs)**. This strategy aims to encourage wider adoption of AI technology, with companies like **Meta and Google** promoting smaller models as cost-effective, energy-efficient, and customizable solutions. These models can be tailored to specific applications and address data handling and regulatory challenges, making them appealing to privacy-conscious customers and businesses in regulated industries. The smaller models also enable AI functionality on mobile devices, with Google and Samsung already integrating them into their smartphones. While companies explore the potential of smaller models, OpenAI's Sam Altman emphasizes the continued importance of building larger models with enhanced capabilities, believing that customers ultimately seek the best performance. This dual focus on small and large language models reflects the AI industry's ongoing pursuit of both accessibility and cutting-edge performance.
