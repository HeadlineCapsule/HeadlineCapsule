# 雷奋银行在俄罗斯的违法行为持续已久

**雷奋银行国际**（Raiffeisen Bank International，RBI）是一家奥地利银行，由于俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后仍继续在俄罗斯开展业务并盈利而受到严格审查。 过去三年，该行的俄罗斯分支产生的利润超过了集团在其他地区的业务利润，尽管西方对俄罗斯经济实施了制裁。 这引起了**美国财政部**和**欧洲中央银行**的关注，后者是雷奋银行的主要监管机构，他们敦促该银行减少在俄罗斯的业务。 尽管雷奋银行表达了退出俄罗斯市场的意愿，但买家的选择需经克里姆林宫批准。 该银行目前有**50 亿欧元**的资本被困在俄罗斯，赚取 16% 的利息，并已成为俄罗斯客户在国际上开展业务的渠道。 尽管该银行因涉足俄罗斯而面临风险，但其股价在过去一年中反弹了 26%，股东们仍相对不受影响。 这种情况突显了美国和欧盟维持压力并考虑实施更多制裁的必要性，以限制俄罗斯参与全球经济。

# Raiffeisen Has Been a Rogue Operator in Russia for Too Long

**Raiffeisen Bank International**, an Austrian bank, has come under scrutiny for its continued operations and profits in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine. The bank's Russian arm has generated profits exceeding the group's other operations for the past three years, even as Western sanctions target Russia's economy. This has caught the attention of the **US Treasury** and the **European Central Bank**, Raiffeisen's primary regulator, who have pushed for the bank to reduce its Russian business. While Raiffeisen has stated its intention to exit the country, it is subject to the Kremlin's approval of any buyer. The bank has **€5 billion** of capital trapped in Russia, earning 16% interest, and has become a conduit for Russian clients to operate internationally. Raiffeisen's shareholders have remained relatively unfazed, with the stock rebounding by 26% over the past year, despite the risks associated with the bank's significant exposure to Russia. The situation underscores the need for the US and EU to maintain pressure and consider additional sanctions to restrict Russia's access to the global economy.
