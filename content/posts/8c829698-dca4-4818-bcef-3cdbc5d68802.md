## 安东尼·奥里里爵士，1936-2024，爱尔兰杰出企业家

**安东尼·奥里里爵士**（Sir Anthony O'Reilly），一位著名的 **橄榄球明星** 和爱尔兰最杰出的 **企业家之一**，于周五去世，享年 88 岁。奥里里，更常见的称呼是托尼，在商业界声名鹊起，这要归功于他 20 世纪 60 年代为爱尔兰乳制品推出的成功的 [**Kerrygold 营销活动**]。这次早期成功为他辉煌的职业生涯奠定了基调，他在商业和体育领域都取得了显著成就。他还以慈善事业而闻名，特别是他创立了 [**爱尔兰基金**]，支持爱尔兰的社区项目。

当奥里里负责 [**爱尔兰乳制品局**]（An Bord Bainne）时，他的商业生涯起飞，这是一个促进爱尔兰乳业发展的政府组织。他创造了成功的营销策略，并在国际上推出了 Kerrygold 品牌。这促使他参与了 [**Erin Foods**]，随后又加入了 [**Heinz**]，他最终成为该公司的首席执行官和第一位非家族董事长。与此同时，他在都柏林创立了一家 **投资公司**，并从事各种商业风险投资，其中包括成功的 [**独立新闻与媒体**]（Independent News & Media）报业集团。

然而，奥里里也经历了挫折。尽管他努力将 [**Waterford Wedgwood**] 打造成一家全球奢侈品集团，但该公司仍在 2009 年破产。他还失去了对 INM 的控制权，面临经济困难，并于 2015 年破产。

奥里里的个人生活同样引人注目。他结过两次婚，有六个孩子。他的第二任妻子 Chryss 是一位著名的马饲养员，来自希腊一个著名的航运家族。奥里里的社会关系广泛，他喜欢讲故事，并在他的乡间别墅 Castlemartin 招待纳尔逊·曼德拉和比尔·克林顿等贵宾。

总之，安东尼·奥里里爵士的一生非同凡响，他在多个领域取得了巨大成功，并对爱尔兰的商业、体育和慈善事业产生了持久影响。他非凡的智慧、决心和魅力与他的非传统背景相结合，推动他在所有努力中追求卓越。

# Sir Anthony O'Reilly, one of Ireland's leading businessmen, 1936-2024

Sir Anthony O'Reilly, a renowned **rugby star** and one of **Ireland's most celebrated businessmen**, has passed away at the age of 88. O'Reilly, better known as Tony, rose to prominence in the business world through his successful **Kerrygold marketing campaign** for Irish dairy products in the 1960s. This early success set the tone for his illustrious career, which included notable achievements in both the business and sports arenas. He was also known for his philanthropy, particularly through the creation of **the Ireland Fund**, which supported community projects in Ireland.

O'Reilly's business career took off when he was put in charge of **An Bord Bainne**, a government organization for promoting Ireland's dairy industry. He created a successful marketing strategy and launched the Kerrygold brand internationally. This led to his involvement with **Erin Foods** and, subsequently, his association with **Heinz**, where he rose to become CEO and the company's first non-family chair. In parallel, he founded an **investment company** in Dublin and pursued various business ventures, including the successful **Independent News & Media** newspaper group.

However, O'Reilly also experienced setbacks. Despite his efforts to build **Waterford Wedgwood** into a global luxury goods group, the company fell into receivership in 2009. He also lost control of INM and faced financial difficulties, eventually being declared bankrupt in 2015.

O'Reilly's personal life was also noteworthy. He was married twice and had six children. His second wife, Chryss, was a noted horse breeder and a member of a prominent Greek shipping family. O'Reilly's social connections were extensive, and he was known for his storytelling and hosting guests such as Nelson Mandela and Bill Clinton at his stately home, Castlemartin.

In summary, Sir Anthony O'Reilly led a remarkable life, achieving great success in multiple fields and leaving a lasting impact on Irish business, sports, and philanthropy. His unusual combination of intelligence, determination, and charm, coupled with his unconventional background, drove him to pursue excellence in all his endeavors.
