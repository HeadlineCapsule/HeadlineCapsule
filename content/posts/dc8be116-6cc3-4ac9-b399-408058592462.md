美国报复性旅游的终结已然到来。

## 美国的“报复性旅游”热潮退去，休闲旅行需求回归正常

**报复性出游**在美国逐渐消退，休闲旅行的需求回落到疫情前的常态，这对酒店、航空等行业造成了影响。万豪国际、Expedia、西南航空和Airbnb等公司都报告了收入增长放缓或低于预期的情况。然而，对于那些面向国际市场和商务旅客的旅行公司来说，仍然存在着机遇，因为这类旅客通常支付更高的费用。

**问题一：休闲需求回归正常会如何影响旅游业的投资策略？** 

从“报复性出游”到“需求常态”，表明投资者应该调整预期，并重新评估他们的投资组合。那些拥有强大国际业务或专注于商务旅客的公司可能更有优势实现增长；而严重依赖国内休闲旅行的公司可能会面临维持高收入的挑战。

**问题二：哪些因素会导致美国旅游需求持续放缓？** 

经济状况、消费者信心、国内外旅行偏好的变化，以及新的疫情波动或地缘政治事件等潜在干扰，都会影响到美国旅游业复苏的速度和可持续性。此外，行业内日益激烈的竞争也可能会影响增长率。

**问题三：像达美航空和希尔顿全球这样的公司如何从商务旅行增加中受益？** 

与休闲旅客相比，商务旅客通常为航空公司和酒店住宿支付更高的费用，这意味着每个顾客可以带来更多的收入。根据美国旅游协会的数据，预计今年国内商务旅客的数量将增长7%，专门针对这一市场的公司可能会在财务表现方面有所改善。这种增长的势头也有助于抵消休闲需求常态化带来的负面影响，为这些公司带来更加平衡的收入来源。

## Summary:
The article discusses how **revenge travel** is fading in the United States as demand for leisure trips normalizes, impacting various sectors such as hotels and airlines. Compancuaries like Marriott International, Expedia, Southwest Airlines, and Airbnb have reported flat or lower than expected growth in revenues due to this shift. However, there are still opportunities for travel companies with more international exposure, particularly those serving business travellers who tend to pay higher rates.

## Interesting Questions:
Q1: How might the normalization of leisure demand impact investment strategies within the travel industry?
A1: The shift from "revenge travel" to "normalized demand" suggests that investors should adjust their expectations and potentially reevaluate their portfolios. Companies with a strong international presence or those catering to business travellers may be better positioned for growth, while companies heavily reliant on domestic leisure trips might face challenges in maintaining high revenues.

Q2: What factors could contribute to the continued slowdown of US-based travel demand?
A2: Several factors can impact the pace of recovery and sustainability of US-based travel demand, including economic conditions, consumer confidence, changing preferences for domestic versus international trips, and potential disruptions such as new pandemic waves or geopolitical events. Additionally, increased competition within the industry could also play a role in affecting growth rates.

Q3: How might companies like Delta Air Lines and Hilton Worldwide benefit from an increase in business travel?
A3: Business travellers typically pay higher fares for airlines and hotel accommodations compared to leisure travellers, which can result in increased revenue per customer. Companies that cater specifically to this segment may see improved financial performance as the number of domestic trips taken by business travellers is expected to increase 7% this year, according to the US Travel Association. This growth could help offset any declines experienced from the normalization of leisure demand and contribute to a more balanced revenue stream for these companies.
