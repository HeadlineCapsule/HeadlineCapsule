劳埃德银行确定了1800万客户为首要增长目标

**摘要：**
劳埃德银行集团（Lloyds Banking Group）确定了 **1800 万客户** 为主要增长目标，并部署了一支关系经理团队向他们销售额外的产品和服务。英国最大的高街银行正在努力深化与这些客户的关系，设定目标在年底前将平均销售的产品数量增加 5%。客户被分为四组：**深化**（1020 万）、**保护和深化**（340 万）和**保护**（510 万）。该银行还使用在线“需求捕获工具”来更好地了解客户需求，从而为未来的销售机会做准备。

在 Lloyds 重组其风险管理职能之后，提出了这一新战略，因为三分之二的执行官认为这是战略转型的障碍。然而，人们担心追求更高利润可能会导致误导销售和利用客户。

**有趣的问题：**

1. 问题：劳埃德银行集团的新策略如何实现其深化与客户关系的目标，它可能面临什么挑战？
   答案：该银行通过部署关系经理来实现这一目标，他们使用在线“需求捕获工具”来更好地了解客户需求。挑战可能包括潜在的误导销售问题以及由于竞争最佳交易而在每个客户上销售超过两款产品的困难。

2. 问题：将客户分为四组有什么影响，这可能会如何影响他们在劳埃德银行集团的体验？
   答案：对客户进行分类使银行能够根据每组增长或保护的潜力量身定制其方法。这可能导致更个性化的服务，但也可能导致一些客户感到被针对或受到购买额外产品和服务的压力。

3. 问题：劳埃德银行集团计划如何在追求增加产品销售的目标时减少误导销售的风险？
   答案：该银行因对潜在误导销售的担忧而重组了其风险管理职能，但这仍然是一个挑战，因为关系经理面临着出售更多产品的压力。 Lloyds 必须在保持与客户的信任和透明度之间取得平衡，同时避免过去误导销售丑闻中的错误。

**Summary:**  
Lloyds Banking Group has identified **18 million customers as prime growth targets** and deployed a team of relationship managers to sell them additional products and services. The UK's largest high street bank is aiming to deepen its relationships with these customers, setting a target to increase the average number of products sold by 5% by the end of cuarto de año. Customers are categorized into four groups: **deepen** (10.2 million), **protect and deepen** (3.4 million), and **protect** (5.1 million). The bank is also using an online "needs capture tool" to better understand customer needs for future sales opportunities.

The new strategy comes after Lloyds reorganized its risk management function, as two-thirds of executives believed it was a block to strategic transformation. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for mis-selling and exploitation of customers in pursuit of higher profits.

**Interesting Questions:**  
1. Q: How does Lloyds Banking Group's new strategy aim to address its goal of deepening relationships with customers, and what challenges might it face?
    A: The bank aims to achieve this by deploying relationship managers who use an online "needs capture tool" to better understand customer needs. Challenges may include potential mis-selling concerns and the difficulty in selling more than two products per customer due to competition for the best deals.
2. Q: What are the implications of categorizing customers into four groups, and how might this impact their experience with Lloyds Banking Group?
    A: Categorizing customers allows the bank to tailor its approach based on each group's potential for growth or protection. This may lead to more personalized service but could also result in some customers feeling targeted or pressured into purchasing additional products and services.
3. Q: How does Lloyds Banking Group plan to miteban the risk of mis-selling while pursuing its goal of increasing product sales?
    A: The bank has reorganized its risk management function in response to concerns about potential mis-selling, but it remains a challenge as relationship managers are under pressure to sell more products. Lloyds must balance this with maintaining trust and transparency with customers while avoiding the mistakes of past mis-selling scandals.
