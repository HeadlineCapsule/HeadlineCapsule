# **Permira** 以 69 亿美元的价格将网站构建器 Squarespace 私有化

**总部位于伦敦的私募股权公司 Permira** 已同意 **收购 Squarespace**，该公司为 **企业家和企业提供构建网站的软件**，交易价值达 **69 亿美元**。这笔交易发生在 Squarespace 的创始人和私募股权所有者将其上市公司私有化三年后。该交易价格比 Squarespace 最近的股价高出 15%，Permira 每股现金收购价为 44 美元。自 2021 年直接上市以来，Squarespace 的股价一直表现不佳，当时疫情推动了一波新创企业涌向其网站设计和电子商务工具。

这笔交易因其规模之大以及 **私募信贷方** 的参与而引人注目，凸显了他们在并购领域的日益影响力。随着传统债务融资成本的上升，**私募信贷基金** 提供了交易融资，包括黑石集团、蓝猫头鹰和 Ares Capital 的基金。Squarespace 现有的私募股权投资者 General Atlantic 和 Accel 也将参与此次收购，创始人 Anthony Casalena 将保留大部分控股权。这笔交易延续了私募股权集团收购公司在 2019 年至 2022 年市场繁荣期间上市公司的趋势。

# Permira to take website builder Squarespace private in $6.9bn deal

**London-based private equity firm Permira** has agreed to **acquire Squarespace**, a company that provides software for **entrepreneurs and businesses to build websites**, in a deal valued at **$6.9 billion**. This move comes just three years after Squarespace's founder and private equity owners took the company public. The transaction represents a 15% premium over Squarespace's recent share price, with Permira offering $44 per share in cash. Squarespace's shares have underperformed since its direct listing in 2021, during which the pandemic drove a wave of new startups to its website design and e-commerce tools.

The deal is notable for its size and the involvement of **private credit backers**, highlighting their growing influence in the M&A space. **Private credit funds**, including those from Blackstone, Blue Owl, and Ares Capital, are providing financing for the transaction, as the cost of traditional debt financing has increased. Squarespace's existing private equity investors, General Atlantic and Accel, will also participate in the takeover, alongside founder Anthony Casalena, who will retain a substantial majority stake. The deal continues a trend of private equity groups acquiring companies that were recently taken public during the buoyant market years between 2019 and 2022.
