# 英国皇家学会与学术界因石油天然气工业的影响而发生争执

**英国** 英国皇家学会与 2000 多名学者之间出现争端，起因是皇家学会拒绝承认石油和天然气公司对气候变化所负有的责任及其对科学研究的影响。

这些学者最初在致英国皇家学会的信中表达了他们的担忧，敦促拥有 363 年历史的这一尊崇机构（艾萨克-牛顿爵士为其历史上著名的院士之一）承认化石燃料行业在推动气候危机方面所负有的责任。然而，皇家学会通过其司库乔纳森-基廷拒绝了这一请求，声称有必要与多个行为体接触以解决气候变化这一复杂问题。

**争端还涉及剑桥大学教授安迪-伍兹与一家主要石油和天然气公司英国石油公司之间未披露的关系，此事被披露于英国皇家学会的一项政策简报文件中**。伍德教授曾担任**英国石油研究院**(已更名)的领导职务，并保留**英国石油公司教授**的头衔，这些职位由该公司资助。然而，在政策简报文件中并未披露上述关联关系，而文件中呼吁在**地质碳捕获和储存**技术方面进行大量投资，而这是化石燃料行业青睐的技术。

英国皇家学会为自己的立场辩护称，该文件提供了明确的贡献者关联信息，而且学会出版了一系列多样化的研究观点。然而，学术界批评皇家学会的立场是“道德懦弱”，反映出学术界在行业资助和影响方面存在更广泛紧张局势。

**争论延伸到了牛津大学，那里的学生活动人士审视了行业代表与学者之间的互动，尤其是迈尔斯-艾伦在大学气候变化研究和政策中的影响力**。艾伦承认曾与英国石油公司、壳牌公司和埃克森美孚等主要石油和天然气公司举行会议，他强调自己倡导这些公司参与资助**碳捕获与封存**技术。

英国皇家学会与学者之间的这一争执突显了应对科学研究、行业影响和气候变化社会应对等复杂关系所面临的持续挑战。

学者们的信件和英国皇家学会的回应是关于化石燃料公司在塑造气候变化叙事和影响科学研究方面所扮演角色这一更广泛辩论的一部分。随着校园活动主义的兴起和对行业资助的审查日益严格，这场争端反映了英国学术界的一个关键时刻，因为它面临着透明度、问责制和面对气候危机的科学诚信等问题。

# Royal Society and Academics Clash Over Influence of Oil and Gas Industry 

**A dispute has emerged between the UK's Royal Society and over 2,000 academics regarding the society's refusal to acknowledge the role of oil and gas companies in climate change and their influence on scientific research**. 

The academics had initially expressed their concerns in a letter, urging the esteemed 363-year-old institution, which counts Isaac Newton among its historic fellows, to recognize the **culpability of the fossil fuel industry in driving the climate crisis**. However, the Royal Society, through treasurer Jonathan Keating, rebuffed this request, stating that engaging multiple actors was necessary to address the complex issue of climate change. 

**The dispute also involves allegations of undisclosed ties between a Cambridge professor, Andy Woods, and BP, a major oil and gas company, in a Royal Society policy briefing document**. Professor Woods held leadership roles at the **BP Institute** (now renamed) and retains the title of **BP Professor**, positions endowed by the company. These affiliations were not disclosed in the document, which called for significant investment in **geological carbon capture and storage**, a technology favored by the fossil fuel industry. 

The Royal Society defended its position, stating that the document provided clear contributor affiliations, and that it publishes a diverse range of research perspectives. However, critics within the academic community have characterized the society's stance as "moral cowardice," reflecting a broader tension in academia regarding industry funding and influence. 

**The debate extends to Oxford University, where student campaigners have scrutinized the interactions between industry representatives and academics, particularly Myles Allen, an influential figure in the university's climate change research and policy**. Allen has acknowledged meetings with major oil and gas companies, including BP, Shell, and Exxon, emphasizing his efforts to advocate for their involvement in funding **carbon capture and storage** technologies. 

This clash between the Royal Society and academics highlights the ongoing challenges in navigating the complex relationships between scientific research, industry influence, and societal responses to climate change.

The academics' letter and the Royal Society's response are part of a broader debate on the role of fossil fuel companies in shaping climate change narratives and influencing scientific research. With rising activism on campuses and increasing scrutiny of industry funding, this dispute reflects a critical moment in the UK's academic community, as it grapples with issues of transparency, accountability, and scientific integrity in the face of the climate crisis.
