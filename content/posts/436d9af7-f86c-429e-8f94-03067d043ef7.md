# 中国汽车高管称西方对过剩产能的指责是“伪概念”

中国**领先汽车制造商**之一**长城汽车**的**高级执行官**驳斥了中国汽车行业**产能过剩**的说法，这与**中国官员**和官方媒体表达的观点一致。在美国拜登政府预计将对中国电动汽车进口关税提高到100%，并对清洁能源进口产品征收额外关税之际，这一反驳尤为引人注目。该执行官Parker Shi认为，这种批评源于对汽车行业动态和汽车工厂设计本质的误解，汽车工厂的设计往往包括过剩的生产产能，以适应未来业务的增长。

**高盛集团**预测，中国今年将生产2,700万辆**乘用车**，尽管其每年产能可达4,880万辆。这一差异源于市场的结构性转变，即**电动汽车**生产增加，而**内燃机**汽车销量下降。此外，预计2023年的汽车出口将增长25%，超过530万辆。Shi的言论与**中国国家主席习近平**的说法一致，习近平最近否认了产能过剩问题的存在，强调中国新能源行业对全球供应和绿色转型带来的益处。

然而，**西方官员**对中国的做法提出了担忧，声称中国利用外资和技术转让补贴国内生产商，然后向国际市场倾销过剩供应。这些担忧促使**欧盟**对进口的中国电动汽车发起调查，并调查向中国太阳能电池板和风力涡轮机制造商提供涉嫌扭曲市场的补贴行为。

# Chinese car executive calls west’s claim of overcapacity a ‘fake concept’

A **senior executive** at **Great Wall Motor**, one of **China's leading car manufacturers**, has rejected claims of **overcapacity** in the country's automotive industry, echoing sentiments expressed by **Chinese officials** and state media. This rebuttal comes ahead of expected plans by the **Biden administration** to increase tariffs on Chinese **electric vehicle** imports to 100%, along with additional tariffs on clean energy imports. The executive, Parker Shi, attributed the criticism to a misunderstanding of the industry's dynamics and the nature of car factory design, which often includes excess production capacity to accommodate future business growth. 

**Goldman Sachs** forecasts that China will produce 27 million **passenger vehicles** this year, despite an annual production capacity of 48.8 million units. This discrepancy is due to a structural shift in the market, with a rise in **electric vehicle** production and a decline in **internal combustion engine** (ICE) car sales. Exports are also expected to increase by 25% in 2023, surpassing 5.3 million cars. Shi's comments align with those of **Chinese President Xi Jinping**, who recently denied the existence of an overcapacity issue, emphasizing the benefits of China's new energy industry for both global supply and the green transition. 

However, **Western officials** have raised concerns about China's practices, alleging that the country has utilized foreign investment and technology transfers to subsidize domestic producers and then dump excess supply on international markets. These concerns have prompted the **European Union** to initiate probes into imported Chinese EVs and investigations into alleged market-distorting subsidies for Chinese solar panel and wind turbine manufacturers.
