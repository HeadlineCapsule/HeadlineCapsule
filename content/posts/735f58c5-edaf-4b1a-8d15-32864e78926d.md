# 新一轮 GameStop 事件揭示了市场上真正的愚者

**美国最近** [***“迷因股狂热”***](https://cn.investing.com/news/%E8%BF%B7%E5%9B%A0%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E7%9A%84%E7%96%AF%E4%B9%B0%E6%84%9F%E6%9F%93%E4%BA%86%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E5%95%86%E4%B8%9A%E5%9C%BA-%E8%BF%99%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88-2066618)** **的复苏凸显了公众市场中存在不了解情况的投资者，而** **[**Keith Gill**](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/11/gamestop-reddit-meme-stock-rally-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-congress-testimony.html) **(又名** **[**Roaring Kitty**](https://www.cnbc.com/2Multiplier/2021/02/02/gamestop-reddit-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-congress-hearing-testimony.html) **) 再次通过他在线影响力影响了股票价格。**

**2021 年，Gill 引发了困境中的电子游戏零售商 GameStop 股票的短暂但大幅上涨，为他赢得了追随者中** **[**“反文化英雄”**](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/29/wallstreetbets-reddit-gamestop-keith-gill-deep-pocketed-players)** **的声誉。本周，Gill 的一条推文，配上一张男人向前倾的画，导致 GameStop 股价在一夜之间翻了一番，其他看似无关的股票也随之上升。**

**虽然 Gill 对其粉丝的影响可能看起来是积极的，但它也有一个阴暗面，这一点在** **[**Andrew Tate**](https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-tate-bitcoin-gamestop-gme-crypto-2022-5)** **的案例中得到了证明。 Tate 以他的争议观点而闻名，他卖掉了比特币来投资 GameStop，并鼓励其他人为对抗权威而采取同样的行动。**

**然而，这一事件中真正的愚者是一些专业投资者，他们没有从之前的 GameStop 事件中吸取教训。尽管存在在线投资者推高股价的风险，但 Gill 最近的推文出现时，GameStop 近三分之一的股份正在被做空，导致那些押注该公司失败的人遭受重大损失。**

**这一历史重演导致批评人士指责做空者缺乏谨慎，一些评论员认为，他们只能怪自己遭受损失。**

**GameStop 事件继续揭示了零售和机构投资者之间复杂的动态关系，前者通常被描绘成不知情或鲁莽，而后者也容易犯代价高昂的错误。**

# New GameStop Saga Reveals True Fools in Markets 

**The recent resurgence of** ***meme-stock madness*** **in the US has highlighted the presence of uninformed investors in public markets, with** ***Keith Gill*** **(aka** ***Roaring Kitty*** **) once again influencing stock prices through his online presence.** 

**In 2021, Gill sparked a brief but significant rally in shares of GameStop, a struggling video game retailer, earning him a reputation as a** ***counterculture hero*** **among his followers.** **This week, a single tweet from Gill, featuring a drawing of a man leaning forward, caused GameStop shares to double in value overnight, along with a rise in other seemingly unrelated stocks.** 

**While Gill's influence may seem positive to his fans, it also has a darker side, as demonstrated by the case of** ***Andrew Tate*** **. Tate, known for his controversial views, sold his bitcoin holdings to invest in GameStop, encouraging others to do the same as an act of defiance against the establishment.** 

**The true fools in this saga, however, are the professional investors who failed to learn from the previous GameStop incident. Despite the risk of online investors driving up stock prices, nearly a third of GameStop shares were being short-sold when Gill's recent tweet appeared, leading to significant losses for those betting against the company.** 

**This repeat of history has led to criticism of short-sellers for their apparent lack of caution, with some commentators suggesting that they have only themselves to blame for their losses.** 

**The GameStop saga continues to reveal the complex dynamics between retail and institutional investors, with the former often portrayed as uninformed or reckless, while the latter are not immune to making costly mistakes.**
