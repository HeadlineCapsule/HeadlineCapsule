加密金融：进入以太层

**证券交易委员会**（SEC）决定不允许ETF发行商参与以太坊质押，这对加密货币市场既有积极也有消极影响。一方面，避免了将以太坊归类为证券，从而可能导致更严格的监管；但另一方面，这也意味着ETF提供商错过了从质押中获得潜在收益的机会，导致他们可能向客户收取更高的费用或减少对市场的参与。

此外，如果由于ETF发行商不参与质押而从市场上撤出大量以太坊，可能会导致供需失衡，从而提高年化收益率。这可能会对投资者和监管者造成意料之外的后果。

国会最近通过的《FIT21》法案是美国建立加密货币监管框架的重要一步。该法案指定商品期货交易委员会为加密货币的主要监管机构，但也引发了人们对SEC在ETF发行商被允许参与质押的情况下将对市场产生多大影响的质疑。

总的来说，虽然不允许ETF发行商参与以太坊质押可能有一些短期好处，但这对投资者和监管者来说长期影响仍不确定。随着华尔街游说改变监管规定，国会继续为加密资产制定明确指导方针，观察这个问题如何发展将很有趣。

The SEC's decision to not allow ETF issuers to participate in ether staking has both positive and negative implications for the crypto market. On one hand, it avoids classifying ether as a security, which could have led to stricter regulations. However, this also means that ETF providers miss out on potential gains from staking, leading them to potentially charge higher fees to customers or reducing their participation in the market.

Moreover, if large amounts of ether are removed from the market due to ETF issuers not participating in staking, it could lead to a supply and demand shock that may increase annualized yield rates. This could have unintended consequences for both investors and regulators alike.

The recent passage of FIT21 by Congress is an important step towards establishing a framework for crypto regulations in the US. The bill designates the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as the main regulator for cryptocurrnies, but it also raises questions about how much influence the SEC will have over the market if ETF issuers are allowed to participate in staking.

Overall, while there may be some short-term benefits to not allowing ETF issuers to engage in ether staking, the long-term implications for both investors and regulators remain uncertain. It will be interesting to see how this issue evolves as Wall Street lobbies for a change in regulations and Congress continues to work on establishing clear guidelnaces for crypto assets.
