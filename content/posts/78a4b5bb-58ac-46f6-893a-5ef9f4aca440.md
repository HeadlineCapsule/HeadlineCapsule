# Silver Lake 在筹集了有史以来规模最大的基金后，目标转向“更大笔的投资”

---

**Silver Lake**，一家知名的专注于科技的**私募股权**公司，其投资组合包括**戴尔**和**奋进公司**，它宣布计划将重心从小型投资转向大型收购，他们将小型投资称为“遗憾区域”。该公司为其第七只私募股权基金筹集了205亿美元，超过了2021年200亿美元的纪录。这一举动背离了大型私募资本集团基金规模缩小的趋势。

联合首席执行官** Egon Durban **和** Greg Mondre **表示，这一战略转变的原因是他们发现最大的投资产生了最高的回报，而疫情期间进行的较小规模的少数股权投资则表现不佳。他们旨在简化投资策略，专注于具有较高实质性回报潜力的交易。

Silver Lake 的策略转变带来了一系列成功的重大收购，例如** VMware **和戴尔，为投资者带来了可观的利润。自2023年初以来，该公司已出售了200亿美元的投资，包括其利润丰厚的 VMware 股份。这使其自2009年以来的基金在扣除费用后的平均年度净回报率达到21%，表现令人印象深刻。

该公司最近达成的交易包括与** Qualtrics **、** Software AG **和奋进公司等公司达成的私有化协议，这些交易的平均股权投资为35亿美元。 Silver Lake 的投资者对这些战略调整表示支持，认识到进行大规模、高可信投资的成功潜力。

Durban 和 Mondre 还强调了他们抓住**人工智能**突破所带来机会的兴趣。他们打算投资于人工智能的基础设施，而不是直接押注于开发大型语言模型的初创企业。 Mondre 最近领导了对** Vantage Data Centers **的64亿美元股权投资，该公司为科技企业提供存储人工智能数据的房地产，这就是这一策略的例证。

此外，Silver Lake 维持了其对戴尔公司的重大持股，预计该公司将从新兴的人工智能东风中大大受益。 Silver Lake 在戴尔公司的转型交易中发挥了关键作用，这表明该公司已成为寻求重新定位其业务的技术高管的值得信赖的合作伙伴。

总的来说，Silver Lake 转向更大笔投资的战略转变及其近年来取得的成功业绩使其成为私募股权领域，尤其是科技行业中一个重要的参与者。

# Silver Lake targets ‘bigger bets’ as it raises its largest fund

---

**Silver Lake**, a prominent technology-focused **private equity** firm with a portfolio including **Dell** and **Endeavor**, has announced its plans to shift focus towards larger takeovers and away from smaller investments, which they refer to as "the regret zone." The firm has just raised $20.5 billion for its seventh private equity fund, surpassing its previous record of $20 billion in 2021. This move goes against the trend of decreasing fund sizes among large private capital groups. 

Co-CEOs **Egon Durban** and **Greg Mondre** attributed this strategic shift to the observation that their largest investments have yielded the highest returns, while smaller minority investments made during the pandemic underperformed. They aim to streamline their investment strategy and focus on deals that offer higher potential for substantial returns. 

Silver Lake's change in strategy has resulted in a series of successful large buyouts, such as **VMware** and Dell, generating significant profits for investors. Since early 2023, the firm has sold down $20 billion in investments, including its lucrative stake in VMware. This has contributed to an impressive average annual net return of 21% after fees on its funds since 2009. 

The firm's recent deals include agreements to take private companies like **Qualtrics**, **Software AG**, and Endeavor, with an average equity investment of $3.5 billion across these transactions. Silver Lake's investors have expressed support for these strategic adjustments, recognizing the potential for success in making large, high-conviction bets. 

Durban and Mondre also highlighted their interest in capturing opportunities arising from breakthroughs in **artificial intelligence**. They intend to invest in the underlying infrastructure of AI without directly betting on startups developing large language models. This strategy is exemplified by Mondre's recent leadership in a $6.4 billion equity investment in **Vantage Data Centers**, which provides properties for tech groups to store AI data. 

Additionally, Silver Lake maintains its substantial holding in Dell, anticipating that the company will greatly benefit from the emerging AI tailwinds. The firm has established itself as a trusted partner for tech executives seeking to reposition their companies, as demonstrated by its pivotal role in Dell's transformative deals.

Overall, Silver Lake's strategic shift towards larger bets and its successful track record in recent years position it as a key player in the private equity space, particularly in the technology sector.
