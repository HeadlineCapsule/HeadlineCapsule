美国众议院投票通过对司法部长梅里克·加兰的不信任案，因为他拒绝向国会提供拜登与俄罗斯总统普京通话录音。

**美国众议院投票通过对司法部长梅里克·加兰的不信任案**

最近，由共和党领导的美國眾議院以216-207的黨派投票結果，對司法部長梅里克·加蘭（Merrick Garland）不遵守命令交出喬·拜登總統與特別顧問羅伯特·赫爾（Robert Hur）採訪音頻錄音的行為表示不信任。在特朗普盟友对司法部发动攻击之际，这次投票是更广泛调查拜登总统及其儿子亨特之间涉嫌商业关系的一部分。

**背景：特别顾问调查和音频录音争议**

2023年1月，梅里克·加兰（Merrick Garland）任命羅伯特·赫爾（Robert Hur）调查总统处理机密信息的方式。尽管没有对拜登总统提出指控，但赫尔2月份的报告引起了争议，因为它描述拜登是一个记忆力有限的“老年人”。

上个月，拜登总统阻止了从他与赫尔的采访中释放音频录音，声称已经向公众提供了转录本。众议院对加兰的不信任投票是在亨特·拜登因联邦枪支指控而被定罪之后，被视为共和党议员与司法部之间持续斗争的一部分，因为他们认为在涉及特朗普总统的调查中存在偏见。

**对梅里克·加兰总检察长和司法部独立性的影响**

众议院对加兰的谴责可能导致起诉，但只有在司法部决定启动法律程序的情况下才能实现。针对这次投票，加兰批评这一举动是无视宪法分权并危及司法部调查的党派武器。

为了解决司法部内部存在偏见的指控，加兰任命了特别顾问。检察官杰克·史密斯（Jack Smith）获得了对前总统特朗普的两项联邦起诉书，而大卫·魏斯（David Weiss）则确保了亨特·拜登因刑事枪支指控而被定罪。

**结论：政治紧张局势和未来影响**

对梅里克·加兰总检察长的不信任投票突显了共和党议员与司法部之间日益紧张的关系，以及对政治干预法律程序的更广泛担忧。这一局势的结果可能会对拜登总统及其儿子亨特之间持续调查产生重大影响，并影响司法部未来的独立性。

 **US House Votes to Hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in Contempt**

In a recent development, the Republican-led US House of Representatives voted 216-207 along party lines to hold attorney general Merrick Garland in contempt for defying an order to hand over audio recordings of Joe Biden's interviews with special counsel Robert Hur. The vote came amidst escalating attacks on the Department of Justice by Trump allies and as part of a broader investigation into alleged business connections between President Biden and his son, Hunter.

**Background: Special Counsel Investigation and Audio Recordings Controversy**

In January 2023, Merrick Garland appointed Robert Hur to investigate the president's handling of classified information. Although no charges were filed against President Biden, a report by Hur in February sparked controversy when it described him as an "elderly man" with limited memory during interviews.

Last month, President Biden blocked the release of audio recordings from his interviews with Hur, stating that transcripts had already been provided to the public. The House's contempt vote against Garland follows a conviction of Hunter Biden on federal firearm charges and is seen as part of an ongoing battle between Republican lawmakers and the Department of Justice over perceived bias in investigations related to President Trump.

**Implications for Attorney General Merrick Garland and DOJ Independence**

The House's censure against Garland could potentially lead to prosecution, but only if the Department of Justice decides to initiate legal proceedings. In response to the vote, Garland criticized the move as a partisan weapon that disregards constitutional separation of powers and jeopardizes DOJ investigations.

Garland has appointed special counsels in an attempt to address accusations of bias within the Department of Justice. Prosecutor Jack Smith obtained two federal indictments against former President Trump, while David Weiss secured a conviction for Hunter Biden on criminal gun charges.

**Conclusion: Political Tensions and Future Implications**

The contempt vote against Attorney General Merrick Garland highlights the increasingly contentious relationship between Republican lawmakers and the Department of Justice, as well as broader concerns about political interference in legal proceedings. The outcome of this situation may have significant implications for both the ongoing investigations into President Biden'amoorish connections with his son Hunter and the overall independence of the DOJ moving forward.
