新泽西州长期的政治老板因勒索罪被起诉

**勒索罪指控：乔治·诺克罗斯**
新泽西州的民主党领袖**乔治·诺克罗斯**被以13项勒索罪起诉。这些指控与卡姆登市重建项目中的税收抵免方案有关。除了诺克罗斯，他的兄弟菲利普和其他三人也被指控为“诺克罗斯犯罪团伙”的一部分。

**税收抵免方案：操纵谋取个人利益**
起诉书侧重于卡姆登市用来吸引公司和开发商的税收抵免政策。据称，诺克罗斯兄弟通过他们的政治影响力操纵这些政策，迫使竞争对手放弃价值数百万美金的相关项目。这些抵免额可以出售或用于抵消州税。在某个案例中，乔治·诺克罗斯威胁拒绝他条款的开发商，警告他在卡姆登市开展业务将面临严重后果。

**政治权力与腐败：新泽西州县界体系受审**
自20世纪80年代末以来，乔治·诺克罗斯一直是新泽西州政治中的一个有影响力的人物，他以支持候选人、提供竞选捐款和重要选票而闻名。然而，由于最近对其他政治人物的腐败指控，如参议员罗伯特·梅嫩德斯，以及法院裁定取消有争议的“县界”体系，这个体系现在正受到审查。

**乔治·诺克罗斯的回应：在面临指控时参加新闻发布会**
尽管面临勒索罪指控，乔治·诺克罗斯仍出席了由新泽西州总检察长马修·普拉特金举行的新闻发布会，宣布了对他的起诉。普拉特金指控诺克罗斯兄弟及其同伙使用犯罪手段控制卡姆登市水滨项目谋取个人利益。

 **Indictment on Racketeering Charges: George Norcross**  
A Democratic party boss from New Jersey, **George Norcross**, has been indicted on 13 counts of racketeering. The charges are related to a scheme involving tax credits in the redevelopment of Camden city. Alongside Norcross, his brother Philip and three other individuals have also been charged as part of the "Norcross criminal enterprise".

**Tax Credit Scheme: Manipulation for Personal Gain**  
The indictment focuses on tax credits used by Camden to attract companies and developers. The Norcross brothers allegedly manipulated these policies through their political influence, forcing rivals to surrender projects worth millions of dollars in associated credits. These credits could be sold or offset against state taxes. In one instance, George Norcross threatened a developer who refused his terms with severe consequences for doing business in Camden.

**Political Power and Corruption: New Jersey's County Line System Under Scrutiny**  
George Norcross has been an influential figure in New Jersey politics since the late 1980s, known for bestowing endorsements, campaign contributions, and prominent ballot placement to favored candidates. However, this system is now under strain due to recent corruption allegations against other political figures like Senator Robert Menendez and a court ruling striking down the controversial "county line" system.

**Response from George Norcross: Attending Press Conference Amidst Charges**  
Despite facing racketeering charges, George Norcross attended the press conference where the indictment was announced by Matthew Platkin, New Jersey's attorney-general. Platkin accused the Norcross brothers and their associates of using criminal means to take control of Camden waterfront for themselves.
