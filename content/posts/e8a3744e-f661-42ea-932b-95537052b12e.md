与石油行业合作对于可持续航空燃料的采用至关重要

**摘要：**
联合航空（United Airlines）首席可持续发展官Lauren Riley强调了与石油行业合作的重要性，以促进可持续航空燃料（SAF）的采用和经济可行性。缺乏基础设施，例如管道访问和对SAF提供商的后勤支持，是一个重大挑战。目前，大多数SAF都是从回收的烹饪油或家庭废物中制成的，但每加仑成本至少是传统喷气燃料的两倍。

联合航空已设定目标，到2050年实现碳排放净零增长；然而，其年度燃料使用量中只有0.1%是可持续的。Riley强调了扩大SAF生产和制造商投资支持以满足航空业需求的必要性。她还对“电解液”燃料等新技术充满信心，这些燃料是通过使用电力从水中提取氢气并从空气中提取碳而生产的。

联合航空去碳化努力的最大风险是2050年之前的时间有限。然而，Riley仍然相信，由于她迄今所见证的创新水平，在给定的时限内实现其碳零目标是可能的。

 **Summary:**  
United Airlines' Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley emphasizes the importance of cooperation with the oil industry to facilitate the uptake and economic viability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The lack of infrastructure, such as pipeline access and logistics support for SAF providers, is a significant challenge. Most SAFs are currently made from recycled cooking oil or household waste but cost at least twice as much per gallon compared to traditional jet fuel.

United Airlines has set a target of acheback net zero carbon emissions by 2050; however, only 0.1% of its annual fuel usage is sustainable. Riley highlights the need for scaling up SAF production and investment support from manufacturers to meet aviation industry requirements. She also expresses optimism about new technologies like "power-to-liquid" fuels, which are produced by using electricity to extract hydrogen from water and carbon from air.

The biggest risk for United Airlines' decarbonization efforts is the limited time available before 2050. However, Riley remains confident that reaching their next zero carbon goal within the given timeline is possible due to the level of innovation she has witnessed so far.
