尽管**对科技的信任**气候下降，但对其服务和股价的需求高于以往。本期通讯将探讨 OpenAI 最近的动态及其对该行业未来的影响。 OpenAI 决定向公众提供其** AI 聊天机器人**和**多模态模型**，引发了人们的兴奋，但该公司从非营利组织到价值数十亿美元的企业的转变也引发了质疑。 

联合创始人 **Ilya Sutskever** 的离职和 CEO **Sam Altman** 权力整合突显了该公司重点的转变。 OpenAI 的成功不仅归功于其研究，也归功于其将突破性成果打包成用户友好型平台的能力，例如 **ChatGPT**，这为其快速的收入增长做出了贡献。 

OpenAI 在营销和品牌认知方面的能力使其与谷歌等更大竞争对手有所不同。据报道，该公司正在与苹果公司进行谈判，并可能推出一款**搜索工具**与谷歌竞争。随着 OpenAI 继续吸引人们的关注并塑造 AI 行业的发展，人们仍然对其追求**人工通用智能（AGI）**的可行性以及其技术对人类潜在影响存在疑问。

# The Lex Newsletter: OpenAI and the case for techno-optimism 

**OpenAI**, a San Francisco-based startup, has become a central player in the world of **artificial intelligence (AI)**, capturing the public's imagination and attracting a massive user base with its **generative AI** offerings. This newsletter edition explores OpenAI's impact and the broader implications for the tech industry.

Despite a climate of declining **trust in tech**, demand for its services and shares is higher than ever. This newsletter edition examines the recent developments at OpenAI and their implications for the future of the industry. OpenAI's decision to offer its **AI chatbot** and **multimodal model** to the public has generated excitement, but the company's transformation from a not-for-profit to a multibillion-dollar enterprise has also sparked questions. 

The departure of co-founder **Ilya Sutskever** and the power consolidation by CEO **Sam Altman** highlight the company's shift in focus. OpenAI's success is attributed not only to its research but also to its ability to repackage its breakthroughs into user-friendly platforms, such as **ChatGPT**, which has contributed to its rapid revenue growth. 

OpenAI's marketing prowess and brand recognition have set it apart from larger rivals like Google. The company is reportedly in talks with Apple and may launch a **search tool** to compete with Google. As OpenAI continues to attract attention and shape the AI landscape, questions remain about the feasibility of its pursuit of **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** and the potential impact of its technology on humanity.

This newsletter also touches on other notable tech stories, including London's efforts to revitalize its stock market, SoftBank's evolving investment strategy, and the rise of AI chatbots among lonely teenagers.
