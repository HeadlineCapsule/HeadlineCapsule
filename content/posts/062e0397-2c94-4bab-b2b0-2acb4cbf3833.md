加纳与债权人达成协议以结束债务违约

**加纳与债权人达成协议** 

在重要进展中，加纳已达成协议，将130亿美元国际债券的价值减少近40%。这项交易预计将帮助西非国家结束近两年的债务违约。所涉及的债权人包括Abrdn、Neuberger Berman、Greylock Capital Management和Amundi。

根据这项协议，这些债权人将放弃其原始索赔中的47亿美元。这项交易是G20批准的“共同框架”的一部分，旨在促进过去面临延迟的主权债务重组流程。债权人对这一重组的批准将帮助加纳遵守国际货币基金组织（IMF）设定的债务目标，并朝着与投资者关系正常化迈进，最终为恢复国际准入铺平道路。

大多数债券将在面值上减少37% 作为新的、期限更长的债务进行重组，以5% 的利率支付利息。这些新债券中高达16亿美元不会受到减少的影响，但将承担1.5% 的较低利率。

国际债权人委员会拥有约40% 的债务，而区域债权人委员会则持有另外15%。该协议预计将在数周内最终确定，并可能帮助加纳在12月选举前退出违约状态，届时总统纳纳·阿库福-阿多将卸任。

加纳的经济挑战始于2022年底近300亿美元的外债，而双位数的通货膨胀以及黄金、可可和石油等主要出口商品的动荡则加剧了这一情况。该国从国际货币基金组织获得了30亿美元的救助金，要求通过G20流程与债权人进行债务减免谈判。

共同框架因加纳等国债权人多样化而难以简化主权债务重组谈判，这使得协调工作变得困难。该协议还包括“最受青睐债权人”条款，并要求加纳每半年发布某些公共债务信息，同时禁止对债券提出法律挑战。

 **Ghana Strikes Deal with Bondholders**  

In a significant development, Ghana has reached an agreement that will reduce the value of its $1n3bn in international bonds by nearly 40%. This deal is expected to help the West African nation end almost two years of default on its debt. The bondholders involved include Abrdn, Neuberger Berman, Greylock Capital Management, and Amundi.

Under this agreement, these creditors will give up $4.7bn of their original claim. This deal is part of a G20-approved "common framework" aimed at facilitating sovereign debt restructuring processes that have faced delays in the past. The bondholders' approval for this restructuring will help Ghana comply with IMF-set debt targets and move towards normalizing relations with investors, ultimately paving the way to restore international access.

The majority of bonds will see a 37% reduction in face value as they are restructured into new debts with longer maturities that pay interest at a rate of ^5%. Up to $1.6bn of these new bonds will not be subjected to the reduction but will carry lower interest rates of ^1.5%.

The international bondholder committee owns about 40% of the debt, while a regional bondholder committee holds another 15%. The agreement is expected to be finalized within weeks and could help Ghana exit default by December elections when President Nana Akufo-Addo steps down.

Ghana's economic challenges began with nearly $30bn in external debts at the end of 2022, exacerbated by double-digit inflation and turmoil in key exports like gold, cocoa, and oil. The country received a $3bn bailout from the IMF that required debt relief talks with creditors through the G20 process.

The common framework has struggled to streamline sovereign debt restructuring negotiations due to an array of creditors in countries like Ghana, making coordination difficult. The deal also includes a "most favoured creditor" clause and requires Ghana to publish certain public debt information semi-annually while barring legal challenges to the bonds.
