# **瑞士银行**首席执行官**瑟吉欧·埃尔莫蒂**批评瑞士监管机构处理**瑞信**事件不当

**瑞士银行（UBS）**首席执行官**瑟吉欧·埃尔莫蒂**强烈批评了瑞士监管机构和当局处理**瑞信（Credit Suisse）**倒闭事件的方式，认为相关方应承认自身角色并承担不足责任。在瑞士银行面临提高资本要求的压力日益增大的情况下，埃尔莫蒂发表了上述言论，分析师预测该行还需150亿至250亿美元的额外资本。他感到惊讶的是，瑞士银行在去年拯救瑞信的过程中发挥了关键作用，但如今却被视为该国的潜在问题。关于提高拥有国际业务银行资本要求的提议引发了争议，埃尔莫蒂指出，作为瑞士最国际化的贷款机构，瑞士银行甚至没有在这一问题上被征询意见。更复杂的是，国际货币基金组织（IMF）对瑞士金融业监督表示关切，这表明其他国家可能也会跟进，提出对本国银行提高资本要求。

# UBS chief Sergio Ermotti criticises Swiss regulators over Credit Suisse

**Sergio Ermotti**, chief executive of UBS, has strongly criticized Swiss regulators and authorities for their handling of **Credit Suisse's** downfall, arguing that those involved should acknowledge their roles and take responsibility for their shortcomings. Ermotti's comments come as UBS faces increasing pressure to increase its capital requirements, with analysts predicting an additional capital need of $15-25 billion. He finds it surprising that UBS, which played a crucial role in rescuing Credit Suisse last year, is now viewed as a potential problem for the country. The proposal to increase capital requirements for banks with international businesses has sparked a debate, with Ermotti noting that UBS, as the country's most global lender, was not even consulted on the matter. The situation is further complicated by the IMF's concerns about supervision in the Swiss financial industry, indicating that other countries might follow suit and propose higher capital requirements for their banks.
