# 刚果被“遗忘”的战争成为生存之战

刚果民主共和国（刚果（金）**）东部**政府军**与**盟友民兵**和**“ M23 叛军”**之间的**持续冲突**升级，戈马市成为冲突的中心。这场战斗吸引了包括联合国在内的各个区域和国际行为者的参与，并导致了一场严重的人道主义危机。

在邻国卢旺达的支持下，M23 已经挺进到戈马市以内 20 公里处，威胁着该市 200 万居民的生命安全，其中包括生活在营地里的数十万**境内流离失所者**。该团体被指控强行招募儿童入伍并犯有其他侵犯人权的行为。卢旺达的介入行为遭到了广泛谴责，联合国、美国、欧盟和天主教会都宣称站在 M23 一边。卢旺达否认这些指控，反而指责刚果（金）窝藏了为 1994 年**卢旺达种族灭绝**负责的胡图族战士。

冲突导致暴力和侵犯人权行为蔓延，联合国在今年年初以来已经登记了每月超过 4000 起**性暴力**案件。被称为“爱国者”的**“ wazalendo”**加入刚果武装部队的情况进一步加剧了冲突，他们也被指控犯有侵犯人权行为。戈马市和周围营地的人道主义局势严峻，霍乱肆虐，频繁的袭击造成平民伤亡。

刚果东部的危机尚未得到国际社会的足够关注，大多数关注焦点都集中在中东和乌克兰冲突上。然而，分析人士指出，这场危机有可能演变成一场更大的地区性冲突，因为经济和地缘政治利益也在起作用。随着战斗的持续，戈马及周边地区人民的未来充满了不确定性和危险。

# Congo's 'forgotten' war becomes a fight for survival

**The ongoing conflict** in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between **government forces and allied militia** and the **M23 rebel group** has escalated, with the city of Goma at its epicenter. The battle has drawn in various regional and international actors, including the UN, and has resulted in a dire humanitarian crisis. 

The M23, backed by neighboring Rwanda, has advanced to within 20km of Goma, endangering the lives of its 2 million residents, including hundreds of thousands of **internally displaced persons** living in camps. The group is accused of forcibly recruiting children and committing other human rights abuses. Rwandan involvement has been widely condemned, with the UN, US, EU, and the Catholic Church all asserting their support for the M23. Rwanda denies the allegations, instead accusing the DRC of harboring Hutu fighters responsible for the **1994 Rwandan genocide**. 

The conflict has resulted in widespread violence and human rights violations, with the UN registering over 4,000 cases of **sexual violence** per month since the start of the year. The situation has been further exacerbated by the involvement of **wazalendo**, or "patriots," who have joined the Congolese armed forces and are also accused of committing abuses. The humanitarian situation in Goma and the surrounding camps is dire, with cholera rampant and frequent attacks causing civilian casualties. 

The crisis in eastern Congo has received relatively little international attention, with efforts focused on conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. However, the situation risks escalating into a larger regional conflagration, with analysts pointing to the economic and geopolitical interests at play. As the fighting continues, the future for those in Goma and the surrounding areas remains uncertain and fraught with danger.
