联合利华高端化妆品品牌需求激增

## 摘要：
联合利华的**高端美容部门**专注于诸如 **Tatcha** 和 **Hourglass** 等高端化妆品品牌，尽管面临着生活成本危机，但该部门的需求却激增。该公司旨在通过集中精力发展顶级品牌并剥离冰淇淋等低利润部门来提高业绩。高端美容部门的 CEO Vasiliki Petrou 表示，美容产品是“**经济衰退时证明了自己**”的，因为它们与消费者信心和自尊心息息相关。该部门已连续 13 个季度实现两位数的销售增长，2023 年营业额达到 14 亿欧元，而 2020 年为 7 亿欧元。高端品牌占联合利华产品的 30%，是该公司未来增长战略的一部分。

## Summary:
Unilever's Prestige division, which focuses on high-end cosmetic brands such as **Tatcha** and **Hourglass**, has experienced a surge in demand despite the cost of living crisis. The company is aiming to improve its performance by concentrating on top brands and divesting lower-margin divisions like ice cream.

The division has seen 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth, with turnover reaching €1.n4bn in 2023 compared to €700mn in 2020. Prestige brands make up 30% of Unilever's products and are part of the company's strategy for future growth.

## Interesting Questions:
1. Q: How has Unilever's focus on high-end cosmetic brands contributed to its overall performance during a cost of living crisis?
A: Despite the economic challenges posed by the cost of living crisis, Unilever's Prestige division focusing on high-end cosmetic brands has seen significant growth. This success can be attributed to consumers prioritizing beauty products as they are considered "recession proof" and linked to confidence and self-esteem. The demand for these luxury items remains strong, even during economic downturns, allowing Unilever's Prestige division to outperform its mass market businesses in food, soap, and detergent.
2. Q: What strategies has the Prestige division employed that differentiate it from other parts of Unilever?
A: The Prestige division follows a distinctive approach compared to other segments within Unilever. It focuses on acquiring luxury brands, allowing them to function independently rather than merging with the group. This decentralized model helps preserve the unique identity and soul of each brand. Additionally, the Prestige division adopts a selective beauty business model that emphasizes quality education, content, advice, and sometimes scarcity for desirability.
3. Q: What potential growth opportunities does Unilever's Prestige division have in terms of market expansion?
A: The Prestige division has significant growth potential in the US, its largest market accounting for 60% of sales, as well as in the UK and China, where consumer demand has been sluggish. Furthermore, there is a growing interest among younger consumers in skin health products, presenting an opportunity to expand into this segment. Additionally, Vasiliki Petrou highlighted the potential for growth in men's beauty products, noting that male customers tend to be more loyal once they discover a product they like.
