七国集团领导人就向乌克兰提供500亿美元贷款达成协议

**七国集团领导人就向乌克兰提供500亿美元贷款达成协议**

各国领导人同意在基辅提供资金，并得到俄罗斯被冻结资产预期收益的支持。七国集团领导人已达成协议，利用俄罗斯被冻结的主权资产收益来帮助**乌克兰**，以在他们应对国内政治困难的同时加强对该国家的支持。

根据在意大利普利亚举行的峰会上达成的协议，七国集团成员将通过“乌克兰特别收入加速贷款”（ERA Loans for Ukraine）提供约50亿美元的资金，并得到俄罗斯资产未来收益的支持。这项融资将通过多个渠道进行分配，将资金用于军事、预算和重建需求。

在莫斯科结束对**乌克兰**的战争并赔偿所造成损失之前，俄罗斯的资产将继续被冻结。欧洲委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩表示，“不是由欧洲纳税人来为俄罗斯在乌克兰造成的损失买单，而是俄罗斯自己。”下一步是确保欧盟成员国批准，签署贷款人、**乌克兰**和任何中间人的合同。

该协议是在多个七国集团国家政治动荡之际达成的，包括美国总统选举、英国选举以及法国和德国的欧洲议会投票，极右翼政党在这些选举中取得了进展。关于利用被冻结资产为**乌克兰**提供额外支持的一致协议表明，七国集团领导人仍然团结一致，支持基辅并致力于更广泛的外交政策优先事项。

俄罗斯的大部分主权资产都持有在欧盟，其中绝大多数是在莫斯科于2022年2月全面入侵**乌克兰**之后被西方国家冻结的。世界银行预计将发挥作用，分配贷款套餐中的美国部分。

 **G7 Leaders Strike Deal on $50bn Loan for Ukraine**

Leaders agree to front-load funding for Kyiv backed by expected profits from frozen Russian assets. G7 leaders have reached a deal to use profits from frozen Russian sovereign assets to help **Ukraine** in an attempt to shore up support for the nation while they grapple with domestic political difficulties.

Under the agreement struck at a summit in Puglia, Italy, G7 members will provide "approximately $5cuadrado billion" to Ukraine backed by future proceeds from Russian assets through 'Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine'. The financing would be disbursed through multiple channels directing funds towards military, budget and reconstruction needs.

Russia's assets will remain immobilized until Moscow ends its war against **Ukraine** and repays the damage it caused. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that "it is not European taxpayers paying for Russian damages [in Ukraine], but Russia." The next steps involve securing approval from EU member states, signing contracts between lenders, **Ukraine** and any intermediaries.

The deal comes at a time of political turmoil in several G7 countries, including the US presidential election, UK elections, and European parliamentary votes that saw far-right parties surge in France and Germany. The agreement on delivering additional support for **Ukraine** using frozen assets would be a sign that G7 leaders remained united in their defense of Kyiv as well as broader foreign policy priorities.

The majority of the Russian sovereign assets are held in the EU, with an overwhelming amount being frozen by western countries following Moscow's full-scale invasion of **Ukraine** in February 2022. The World Bank is expected to play a role in disbursing the US slice of the loan package.
