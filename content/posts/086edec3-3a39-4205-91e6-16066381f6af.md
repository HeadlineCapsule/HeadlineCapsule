# 开云集团高管表示古驰将专注于打好“基础” 

---

 **开云集团副首席执行官** [**弗朗西斯卡·贝莱蒂尼**](Francesca Bellettini)透露了一项回归基本计划的细节，以重振该集团旗下旗舰品牌 Gucci 的活力。在《金融时报》举办的 Business of Luxury 奢侈品大会上，贝莱蒂尼强调了古驰在经历一段快速增长后建立 **“稳固基础”** 的必要性。此前古驰的销量增速有所放缓，导致业务出现裂痕。作为集团销售额的一半和利润的三分之二来源，Gucci 的 **业绩不佳** 一直令这家法国奢侈品集团感到担忧。贝莱蒂尼于去年被任命管理开云旗下所有品牌，其目标是提升古驰的 **"吸引力"**、独特性、品质及效率。其中包括一些关键的人事变动，如聘请新的运营主管来主导减少皮具产品交付周期等举措。该公司还寄希望于 Gucci 的 **新任创意总监** Sabato de Sarno能够通过即将推出的系列重振销量增长。贝莱蒂尼相信德萨诺是古驰第一位非内部提拔的创意总监，他将为品牌复兴带来全新的视野，防止“不一定适合未来的工作方式。”

# Gucci focused on building ‘sound foundations’, Kering’s top executive says 

---

**Kering's Deputy Chief Executive**, **Francesca Bellettini,** has revealed plans to go "back to basics" in order to revive the company's flagship brand, Gucci. Speaking at the Financial Times' Business of Luxury conference, Belletini emphasized the need for Gucci to build **"sound foundations"** after a period of rapid growth that has now tapered off, exposing fissures in the business. The **underperformance** of Gucci, which accounts for half of Kering's sales and two-thirds of its profits, has been a concern for the French luxury group. Bellettini, who was appointed to oversee all of Kering's brands last year, aims to enhance the brand's **"attractivity"**, exclusivity, quality, and efficiency. This includes making key hires, such as a new head of operations focusing on initiatives like reducing lead times for leather goods. The company is also betting on Gucci's **new creative director** Sabato de Sarno to revive growth with their upcoming collections. Belletini believes that De Sarno, the first outsider appointed as Gucci's creative director, will bring a fresh perspective to rebuilding the brand and preventing "ways of working that are not always right for the future."
