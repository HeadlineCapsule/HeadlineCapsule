南非反对党对西里尔·拉马福萨的统一政府计划反应冷淡

# 南非反对党对齐里尔·拉马福萨的全国统一政府提议反应冷淡

南非反对党对总统西里尔·拉马福萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）提出的全国统一政府提议反应冷淡，经济自由战士（EFF）和姆科托韦西兹韦（MK）领导人表达了保留意见。 EFF领导人朱利叶斯·马勒马（Julius Malema）批评非洲国民大会（ANC）提出这一提议是傲慢之举，而MK则表示由于个人问题，他们不会与拉马福萨谈判。

南非第二大政党民主联盟（DA）最初拒绝与之前拒绝宪法的政党组成联盟，但后来表示愿意加入任何符合其原则的政府。西里尔·拉马福萨总统在ANC在上周的选举中仅获得40.2%的选票后提议成立统一政府，这是自1994年自由选举以来ANC首次成为少数党。

一些分析人士认为，由于EFF和MK等政党之间存在政策冲突，组建全国统一政府将充满挑战。这些政党提倡废除或修改宪法，而DA则倡导其原则，如保护中央银行独立性。批评者认为，拉马福萨的提议是试图避免在ANC内的左翼和右翼政党之间做出艰难的决定。

 **Summary of Article:**
South African opposition parties responded coolly to President Cyril Ramaphosa's proposal for a government of national unity, with leaders from Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) expressing reservations. The EFF leader Julius Malema criticized the African National Congress (ANC) for arrogance in making such a proposal, while MK stated they would not negotiate with Ramaphosa due to personal issues.

The Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa's second-largest party, initially rejected coalitions with parties that had previously rejected the constitution but later expressed openness to joining any government meeting their principles. President Cyril Ramaphosa proposed a unity government after the ANC obtained just 40.2% of votes in last week's election, pushing it into a minority for the first time since free elections in 1994.

Some analysts believe that forming a national unity government would be challenging due to conflicting policies among parties like EFF and MK, which advocate scrapping or amending the constitution, while DA promotes its principles such as protecting central bank independence. Critics argue that Ramaphosa's proposal is an attempt to avoid making difficult decisions between left-leaning and right-leaning parties within the ANC.
