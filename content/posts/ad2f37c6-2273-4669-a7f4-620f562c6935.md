# **基尔·斯塔默**面临着娜塔莉·埃尔菲克叛逃事件越来越多的反对声

**工党领袖** [**基尔·斯塔默**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer) 面临着党内议员越来越多的反对声，原因是前 **保守党议员** [**娜塔莉·埃尔菲克**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Elphicke) 叛逃到了工党，而她有争议的政治立场和她卷入她声名狼藉的前夫性侵案成为争议焦点。 多佛尔议员埃尔菲克上周叛逃到工党，斯塔默将此举作为工党不断扩大的政治吸引力的证据。 然而，许多工党议员对这一举动感到愤怒，因为埃尔菲克的 **右翼观点** 以及她过去支持她的前夫 **查理·埃尔菲克** 的言论，查理·埃尔菲克因性侵罪被判入狱。

事件最新进展显示，埃尔菲克在丈夫庭审前曾游说当时的司法大臣 **罗伯特·巴克兰** 爵士，要求他介入并将庭审移至另一法院，以限制庭审的公开程度。 巴克兰拒绝了这一请求，称其为 "**违反宪法**"。 埃尔菲克否认有任何不当行为，工党也为她辩护，指责巴克兰现在只是因为她叛逃而做出指控。 **影子主计长** [**乔纳森·阿什沃思**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ashworth) 表示，埃尔菲克对保守党政府在住房和移民问题上的失败感到失望和被辜负。他还强调了保守党内的 "分裂和衰落"，称埃尔菲克的叛逃是工党的一个积极进展。 然而，一些工党议员对斯塔默处理此事的方式仍感到愤怒，并表示不信任他的领导能力。

# Keir Starmer faces deepening backlash over Natalie Elphicke defection 

**Sir Keir Starmer**, the **Labour leader**, is facing a strong backlash from his own MPs over the defection of **Natalie Elphicke**, a former **Conservative MP**, due to concerns about her political stance and her involvement in her disgraced ex-husband's sexual assault case. Elphicke, the MP for Dover, defected to Labour last week, with Starmer presenting it as proof of Labour's widening political appeal. However, many Labour MPs are angry about the move due to Elphicke's **right-wing views** and her past comments supporting her ex-husband, **Charlie Elphicke**, who was convicted and jailed for sexual assault. 

/n/n

It has now emerged that Elphicke lobbied **Sir Robert Buckland**, the then-justice secretary, before her husband's trial, asking him to intervene and move the trial to a different court to limit publicity. Buckland refused, calling the request a "**constitutional outrage**". Elphicke denied any wrongdoing, and Labour has defended her, accusing Buckland of making claims now only because of her defection. The **shadow paymaster general**, **Jonathan Ashworth**, said Elphicke was disappointed and let down by the Conservative government's failures on housing and immigration. He also highlighted the "disintegration and decay" within the Conservative Party, celebrating the defection as a positive development for Labour. However, some Labour MPs remain furious with Starmer's handling of the situation, expressing distrust in his leadership.
