博阿斯·韦因斯坦（Boaz Weinstein）没能成功夺取黑石基金。

# 摘要：

博阿斯·韦因斯坦（Boaz Weinstein）对黑石公司管理某些封闭式基金的管理方式发起的运动遭遇挫折，因为股东拒绝了他的董事提名，并投票决定保留现任管理层。萨巴资本（Saba Capital）由韦因斯坦领导，认为这些基金的表现落后于竞争对手，且交易价格低于其资产价值。然而，黑石公司宣布，在十只基金中，有八只基金的股东保留了该公司董事的职位，五次终止尝试以失败告终。

# 要点：

- 激进的对冲基金经理博阿斯·韦因斯坦寻求在黑石公司管理的两只封闭式基金中担任董事职位，总市值约为10亿美元。
- 在十只基金中，股东拒绝了萨巴资本的提名，并投票决定保留八只基金中的现任管理层。五次终止尝试以失败告终。两只基金将投票截止日期推迟到7月16日。
- 封闭式基金发行一定数量的公开交易股票，不允许投资者以净资产价值赎回，且可能出现股价与基础资产价值之间的差异。萨巴资本在封闭式基金中投资了58亿美元，经常推动管理层缩小估值差距或将基金转换为允许赎回的开放式结构。
- 黑石公司反驳了萨巴资本的说法，称在其接管的两只封闭式基金中，管理费上涨，且基金交易价格仍低于同行，这一情况由晨星公司衡量。
- 代理投票顾问机构股东服务公司（Institutional Shareholder Services）建议股东拒绝终止请求，但支持萨巴资本部分提名人选。

 **Article Summary:** Boaz Weinstein's campaign against BlackRock's management of certain closed-end funds has faced setbacks, as shareholders rejected his director nominees and voted to retain the current managers. Saba Capital, led by Weinstein, argued that these funds underperformed competitors and traded at a discount to their asset values. However, BlackRock announced that eight of the funds' shareholders retained the company's directors, with five termination attempts failing.

**Key Points:**
- Activist hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein sought director positions in 10 closed-end funds managed by BlackRock, totaling a market value of about $1n billion.
- Shareholders rejected Saba's nominees and voted to retain the current managers for eight out of ten funds. Five termination attempts failed. Two funds have delayed their voting deadline to July 16.
- Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of publicly traded shares, do not allow investors to redeem at net asset values, and can experience discrepancies between share price and underlying assets' value. Saba Capital has $5.8 billion invested in closed-end funds and often pushes managers to shrink valuation gaps or convert funds to an open-end structure that allows redemptions.
- BlackRock argued against Saba's claims, stating its management fees rose at two closed-end funds it took over from Voya and Franklin Templeton, with the funds continuing to trade at a bigger discount than their peers as measured by Morningstar.
- Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended shareholders reject termination requests but support some of Saba's nominees.
