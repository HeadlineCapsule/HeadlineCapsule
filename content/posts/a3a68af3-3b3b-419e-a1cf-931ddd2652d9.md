 **Summary:**  
Thames Water, a regional monopoly providing water and sewerage services to London and southern England, warns that its ageing assets pose significant risks to public safety, water supply, and the environment. The company reports around £1n 19bn of assets in poor or failed condition, including crumbling pipes, obsolete technology, and a shortage of reservoirs.

**Key Points:**  
- Thames Water's ageing infrastructure includes approximately £19bn worth of assets that are failing to perform their functions reliably.
- The company faces risks such as rapid flooding in basement properties, Cryptosporidium contamination in drinking water, and financial collapse due to underinvestment.
- Thames Water proposes a 59% increase in household bills over the next five years to fund necessary improvements and debt repayments.
- The company has been struggling with £18bn of debt and is hoping for regulatory changes that would allow it to raise additional funds.
- Ofwat, the water regulator, will make a draft decision on Thames Water's business plan by July 11th.

**Themes:**  
- Aging infrastructure poses risks to public safety and environmental concerns in London and southern England.
- Financial challenges faced by Thames Water due to underinvestment, debt burden, and the need for significant capital expenditure.
- Proposed increase in household bills as a means of funding necessary improvements and addressing financial issues.
