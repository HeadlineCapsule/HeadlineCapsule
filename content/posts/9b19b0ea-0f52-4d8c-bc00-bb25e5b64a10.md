# 尽管旅游业繁荣，日本航空公司仍落后 

**日本旅游业**蓬勃发展，受**日元疲软**吸引，3月海外游客人数创纪录，**旅游业支出**也创下季度新高，有助于实现日本政府到2030年达到年旅游收入15万亿日元的目标。然而，**日本航空公司**却没有得到好处，两大航司**日本航空（JAL）**和**全日空（ANA）**的股价在过去一年停滞不前。这与大范围的**日经225指数**表现出大幅增长形成鲜明对比。 

日元疲软对航空公司具有双重影响，一方面**燃料成本**增加，另一方面日本人出国旅行的欲望也**下降**。疫情后出国旅行的缓慢复苏证明了这一点，第一季度出境的日本旅客人数比疫情前水平下降了近40%。长途航班需求没有复苏，去夏威夷的游客人数少表明了这一点，这对航空公司的盈利能力是一个特别值得关注的问题。航空公司要想全面复苏，除了旅游业之外，还需要其他因素，包括**工资增长**、家庭支出和汇率稳定。

# Japan's Airlines Lag Despite Tourism Boom 

**Japan's tourism industry** is booming, with a record-breaking number of overseas visitors in March, attracted by the **weak Japanese yen**. This has boosted **spending in the sector** to new quarterly records and is helping the government's goal of achieving ¥15tn in annual tourism revenue by 2030. However, **Japan's airlines** are not reaping the benefits, with shares of the two biggest carriers, **Japan Airlines (JAL)** and **All Nippon Airways (ANA)**, stagnating over the past year. This is in stark contrast to the broader **Nikkei 225 index**, which has seen substantial gains. 

The weak yen has a dual impact on airlines, increasing **fuel costs** while also making outbound travel less appealing to Japanese citizens. This is evident in the slow recovery of **post-pandemic outbound travel**, with Japanese travelers leaving the country down by nearly 40% in the first quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. The lack of recovery in long-haul flight demand, as indicated by low visitor numbers to Hawaii, is a particular concern for airline profitability. A full rebound in the airline industry will depend on factors beyond tourism, including **wage growth**, household spending, and currency stability.
