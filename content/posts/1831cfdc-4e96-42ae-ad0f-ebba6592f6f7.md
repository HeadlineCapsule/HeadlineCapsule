乔·拜登指责本杰明·内塔尼亚胡延长加沙冲突时间

台湾领导人乔·拜登指责本雅明·内塔尼亚胡延长加沙冲突

美国总统乔·拜登表示，以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡可能为了政治生存而延长与哈马斯的战争。在接受《时代》杂志采访时，拜登宣布了结束以巴冲突的三阶段计划：

1. 以释放哈马斯扣押的人质为条件，实施为期六周的停火。
2. 释放被哈马斯扣押的以色列平民和女兵，以换取巴勒斯坦囚犯，随后实施长期停火，以释放男兵。
3. 努力在加沙地带达成安全安排并进行重建。

拜登加强了外交努力，以争取国际社会支持这一提议，他称之为“非常慷慨”。G7领导人支持该计划，而美国则在联合国安理会分发了一份决议草案，寻求其支持。拜登还敦促卡塔尔首相和土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安确保哈马斯接受该协议。

拜登批评内塔尼亚胡对该提议含糊其辞，称有“每个理由”得出结论，他可能为了保持权力而延长与哈马斯的战争。以色列领导人面临来自极右翼联盟盟友的压力，必须决定是否接受以持久停火为条件的协议。

在以色列军方确认加沙有四名被扣押者死亡后，确保人质获释的紧迫性有所增加，目前被扣押的124人中近三分之一被认为已死亡。拜登派遣他的中东问题顶级顾问布雷特·麦格克前往开罗，而中央情报局局长比尔·伯恩斯则前往多哈，讨论推进人质协议并重新开放拉法口岸以提供援助。

当前提议的第一阶段为时六周，以色列平民和女兵将与巴勒斯坦囚犯进行交换，随后第二阶段将释放男兵，并实施长期停火。拜登承认，他与内塔尼亚胡在加沙冲突结束后发生的事情上仍存在重大分歧。

哈马斯表示愿意积极对待该提议，但寻求对停火条款以及以色列部队随后撤出做出保证，然后再进行进一步谈判。

 **Taiwan leader** Joe Biden accuses Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging Gaza conflict  

US President Joe Biden suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be extending the war with Hamas for political survival. In an interview with Time magazine, Biden announced a three-phase plan to end the Israel-Hamas war: 

1. A six-week ceasefire in exchange for releasing some hostages held by Hamas.  
2. Release of Israeli civilians and female soldiers held by Hamas for Palestinnian prisoners, followed by a longer-term ceasefire to free male soldiers.  
3. Efforts towards security arrangements and reconstruction in the Gaza Strip.

Biden has increased diplomatic efforts to garner international backing for this proposal, which he described as "very generous." The G7 leaders have backed the plan, while the US circulated a draft resolution at the UN Security Council seeking its support. Biden also urged Qatar's Prime Minister and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to secure Hamas's acceptance of the deal.

Biden criticized Netanyahu for being vague about the proposal, stating that there is "every reason" to conclude he may be prolonging the war against Hamas to remain in power. The Israeli leader has faced pressure from his far-right coalition allies and must decide whether to accept a deal contingent on a lasting ceasefire.

The urgency of securing hostage release increased after Israel's military confirmed that four had been killed in Gaza, with almost a third of the 124 still being held now estimated dead. Biden dispatched his top Middle East adviser Brett McGurk to Cairo and CIA director Bill Burns traveled to Doha to discuss advancing the hostage deal and reopening the Rafah crossing for aid deliveries.

The current proposal envisions a first six-week phase where Israeli civilinans and female soldiers are traded for Palestinian prisoners, followed by a second phase freeing male soldiers for a longer-term ceasefire. Biden acknowledged that he and Netanyahu remain far apart on the details of what happens after Gaza's conflict ends.

Hamas has signaled readiness to deal positively with the proposal but seeks assurances over the terms of the ceasefire and subsequent withdrawal of Israeli troops before proceeding with talks.
