习近平声称美国希望中国攻击台湾。

# 习近平：美国试图挑拨中国攻击台湾

据了解习近平主席与欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩会面情况的人士称，中国国家主席习近平声称，美国正在试图挑拨中国攻击台湾。据报道，习近平还向国内官员发出了这一警告。这一说法揭示了台湾问题这个中美关系中最具争议性的问题之一。

自5月赖清德就任台湾新总统以来，台海紧张局势升级，中国随后在台湾周围进行了军事演习。拜登政府坚持根据《台湾关系法》协助台湾的义务，但同时也反对单方面改变现状或支持台湾独立。

一些中国学者认为，华盛顿正在鼓励台湾独立的势力，如果台湾宣布独立，可能会促使中国采取军事行动。习近平的这一说法揭示了中国决策环境中可能存在的错误信息问题，以及试图让欧洲远离美国对台湾问题的政策的可能性。

## 要点：
- 中国国家主席习近平声称，华盛顿正在试图挑拨北京攻击台湾。

 **Summary of Article:**

Chinese President Xi Jinping has claimed that the US is attempting to provoke China into attacking Taiwan, according to reports from people familiar with a meeting between him and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The warning was also reportedly given to domestic officials in China by Xi. This claim sheds light on the complex issue of Taiwan, which remains one of the most contentious points in US-China relations.

Tensions have escalated across the Taiwan Strait following May's inauguration of Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's new president and China's subsequent military exercise around the island. The Biden administration maintains its obligation to assist Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, but also opposes unilateral changes to the status quo or support for Taiwanese independence.

Some Chinese academics believe that Washington is encouraging independence forces in Taiwan and may be pushing China towards military action if a red line is crossed by declaring independence. The revelation of Xi's claim raises concerns about potential misinformation within China's decision-making environment, as well as the possibility of an attempt to distance Europe from US policies on the Taiwan issue.
