交易员在英国大选前下注碳信用额度价格上涨创纪录

**新闻摘要：** 

交易员们正在英国大选前大举押注碳信用额度的价格上涨。这一波上涨是由人们预期新当选的工党政府将采取更严格的气候政策驱动的，这会使工业污染者排放二氧化碳的成本更高。自首相里希·苏纳克宣布大选以来，英国碳市场许可证的基准价格已上涨9%，周五达到每吨二氧化碳47英镑。

**要点：**
- 交易员们大力押注工党政府将带来更严格的气候政策，从而导致碳信用额度价格上涨。
- 自宣布大选以来，英国碳市场许可证的基准价格上涨了9%，周五达到每吨二氧化碳47英镑。
- 对冲基金和资产管理公司持有价值3亿英镑的净多头头寸，这是该计划2021年推出以来的最高水平。
- 工党尚未公开其干预立场，但声称拥有一个长期计划，即使英国成为一个清洁能源超级大国。
- 与欧盟全面的交易系统相比，英国碳价格仍然折扣很大，这可能会导致欧盟碳边境税，并复杂化未来与爱尔兰的贸易安排。

 **Article Summary:** 

Traders are placing record bets on an increase in the price of carbon credits ahead of the upcoming UK election. This surge is driven by expectations that a newly elected Labour government would adopt stricter climate policies, making it more expensive for industrial polluters to emit CO₂. The benchmark price for UK carbon market allowances has climbed 9% since Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the general election and rose to £47 per tonne of CO₂ on Friday.

**Key Points:**
- Traders are betting heavily that a Labour government would bring in stricter climate policies, leading to higher carbon credit prices.
- The benchmark price for UK carbon market allowances has increased by 9% since the announcement of the general election and reached £47 per tonne of CO₂ on Friday.
- Hedge funds and asset managers are holding net long positions worth £300mn, the highest level since the scheme's launch in 2021.
- Labour has not publicly stated its stance on intervention but claims to have a long-term plan for making Britain a clean energy superpower.
- The UK carbon price still trades at a steep discount compared to the EU-wide trading system, which could lead to significant EU carbon border taxes and complicate trade arrangements with Ireland in the future.
