# 对冲基金老板保罗·马歇尔在打捞沉船白银案中败诉

对冲基金[**马歇尔·韦斯**](https://cn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A9%AC%E7%A7%91%E5%B0%94%C2%B7%E9%9F%A6%E6%96%AF%E5%AF%8C%E5%88%A9%E4%BA%9A)（**Marshall Wace**）的负责人**保罗·马歇尔爵士**在争夺二战沉船打捞的白银所有权一事上，与**南非政府**进行了法律斗争，但以失败告终。这些白银价值4300万美元。英国**最高法院**裁定，南非政府拥有**主权豁免权**，无须对其主权行为支付赔偿金，因此无需向马歇尔的公司[**“阿根廷探索”公司**](http://www.argentum-exploration.com/)支付赔偿。虽然“阿根廷探索”公司从1942年沉没的“提拉瓦”号（**SS Tilawa**）上打捞出了2364块白银，但法院推翻了先前的裁决，裁定这些白银并非用于**商业用途**。双方达成了**保密协议**，南非政府获得了这批白银的所有权。这一裁决开创了涉及历史沉船打捞作业的先例，凸显了在打捞作业中识别原始所有者和做出合同安排的重要性，以避免法律纠纷。

这一裁决突显了打捞法及其历史、商业和法律利益交织的复杂性。

# Hedge fund boss Paul Marshall loses case over silver salvaged from shipwreck

---

**Sir Paul Marshall**, who heads the hedge fund **Marshall Wace**, lost a legal battle with the **South African government** over rights to $43 million worth of silver bars salvaged from a WWII shipwreck. The UK's **Supreme Court** ruled that the South African government had **sovereign immunity** and was not liable for compensation to Marshall's company, **Argentum Exploration**. Argentum had retrieved 2,364 silver bars from the SS Tilawa, which sank in 1942, but the court found that the silver was not intended for **commercial use**, overturning previous rulings. A **confidential settlement** has since been reached between the parties, with the South African government taking ownership of the silver. The case sets a precedent for future salvage operations involving historical wrecks, highlighting the importance of identifying original owners and making contractual arrangements to avoid legal complications.

The ruling underscores the complexities of salvage law and the interplay of historical, commercial, and legal interests in such endeavors.
